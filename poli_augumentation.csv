"Michelle Obama Suffering From Severe Emotional Distress, Says Former Advisor  
Michelle Obama has been keeping a low profile since leaving the White House, only occasionally stepping into the public eye to make pointed comments about the current administration. Over the past few years, her behavior has raised eyebrows, with some suggesting she's been acting out of character. While she's tried to downplay any concerns, a close associate has now revealed what they believe is seriously wrong with her, confirming long-held suspicions among critics.

Many have noticed that Michelle’s actions in the final months of her husband’s presidency were unusual, and her behavior has only grown more erratic since leaving the White House. Despite efforts to remain in the spotlight, many Americans are tired of her constant criticism and feel she’s lost touch with the realities of the country. Now, we understand why she’s been so determined to stay relevant.

Her growing disdain for America became more apparent as her husband’s time in office came to an end. She seized every opportunity to criticize the nation, a pattern that has continued in her post-presidential life. According to Dr. Michael T. Carson, a former senior advisor to the Obama administration and author of “The First Lady’s Influence: Power, Perception, and Legacy,” Michelle has been struggling with emotional instability that has worsened over time.

Carson recently spoke about this in an interview with The Conservative Chronicle, stating:

“She’s been under immense pressure for years, and it’s starting to show. Her public remarks have become increasingly harsh and unbalanced, which is not typical of someone in her position.”

In his book, Carson also noted that Michelle Obama has been more visible than any other first lady in recent history, often using her platform to push specific agendas. He pointed out that her most controversial statements came during the final days of the Obama administration, when she accused the country of being fundamentally racist and claimed she had never felt proud of America until her husband was elected.

This sentiment has only intensified in recent months, with Michelle making claims that America is in a state of hopelessness under Trump’s leadership. It's ironic, given that she once said her husband's election was the only time she felt pride in the nation.

One of her most criticized moves was her decision to remove chocolate milk from school lunches, a policy that faced heavy backlash. When Trump reversed the decision, it was seen by many as a symbolic blow to her legacy.

"A former Texas church shooter was known for spreading anti-religious viewsA former classmate of Devin Kelley, the man accused of opening fire at a Texas church that killed 26 people, revealed he was an outspoken atheist who frequently criticized religion online and struggled to connect with others, according to reports.

""Devin would constantly mock people who believed in God, calling them ignorant and trying to convert others to his way of thinking,"" said a former acquaintance, who spoke to the Daily Mail. ""I just stopped talking to him because I couldn’t handle his constant negativity.""

Another friend recalled how Kelley often posted aggressive comments about faith on social media, saying, ""He was always attacking religion, and it got really annoying. I finally blocked him.""

Interestingly, Kelley listed teaching Sunday school as part of his volunteer work on LinkedIn, and his wife had once worked at a Christian church, according to the report.

A longtime friend expressed shock upon learning of the tragedy, saying, ""It’s terrifying to think I used to hang out with someone like this. I even stayed over at his house when we were kids. I can’t believe he did this.""",1
"A new royal corgi, the last of Queen Elizabeth II's original line, passes away, reports British media. London (BBC) The final descendant of the Queen's famous corgi family, 13-year-old Daisy, was euthanized at Balmoral Castle on Friday after a prolonged illness, according to UK news outlets.

Daisy was the last of the original corgis that once filled the royal estate, as reported by the Sunday Times.

Buckingham Palace has not officially addressed the dog's passing, stating it was a private family event.

The Queen's affection for corgis is widely documented, with Daisy having once been seen alongside actor Hugh Grant during a promotional video for the 2016 Royal Variety Performance.

It is said that the Queen has owned over 35 corgis throughout her long reign.

Although the monarch still has several other dogs in her care, Daisy was the only remaining direct descendant of Susan, the first corgi gifted to Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

"Pro-Life Advocates Claim “Sperm Waste Is Genocide: Every Ejaculation Kills a Human Being”  
The pro-life community in the United States has consistently argued that human life starts at conception and that the fetus deserves legal protection. But recently, a radical new perspective has emerged, pushing the abortion debate into uncharted territory. While religious groups have long held differing views on reproductive rights, a growing faction of pro-lifers is now asserting that “ejaculation is genocide” and that every act of self-pleasure results in the destruction of countless human lives.

“Life begins at the moment of creation,” said David Mercer, a leading pro-life speaker. “God designed semen to be used for procreation, not for personal pleasure. Every time a man ejaculates without the intent to create life, he is committing mass murder. Each sperm cell is a potential human being, and we are killing them daily.”

Mercer’s group is now demanding nationwide legislation that would criminalize masturbation, arguing that it constitutes the intentional destruction of human life. “Millions of unborn children are lost every day due to selfish desires and exposure to explicit content,” he claims. “We must take action before it’s too late. Stop the waste, save the future!”

A petition titled “End the Sperm Holocaust” has gained over 70,000 signatures on Change.org in just two weeks, with a goal of 100,000 to prompt a White House response. This week, 32 conservative lawmakers—surprisingly all male—have publicly pledged support for the initiative if it reaches the legislative floor.",1
"Lisa Page Speaks Out: DNC Server Breach Was Actually Perpetrated by China  

Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer who worked under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has emerged as a new whistleblower, claiming that the FBI suppressed critical information about the DNC server breach.  

During closed-door testimony before the House, Page alleged that her superiors at the FBI directed her to hide the fact that China, not Russia, was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee’s server.  

According to reports from Truepundit.com, Page implicated high-ranking FBI officials including James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, and Bill Priestap, accusing them of suppressing intelligence that revealed Chinese state-backed operatives had illegally accessed over 30,000 of Hillary Clinton’s missing emails.  

The story claims that while the media and Democrats focused on Russian interference, it was actually China that obtained Clinton’s sensitive communications from her private email server.  

A public disclosure of this would have severely damaged Clinton’s presidential bid, but instead, the FBI chose silence.  

FBI leadership allegedly knew about the breach but failed to investigate, possibly to avoid undermining Clinton during her race against Trump. Rather than pursuing the Chinese connection, they allowed the matter to fade.  

The stolen data included hundreds of classified documents, presidential security schedules, and all of Clinton’s outgoing emails. Despite warnings from the Inspector General — specifically directed at Strzok — no action was taken.  

This pattern of inaction mirrors other instances where the FBI delayed or concealed evidence related to Clinton in the final weeks before the election.  

As more details surface, one question remains: Who will be held accountable for manipulating the FBI to shield a political ally and suppress critical national security information?",1
"Oscar Pistorius Allegedly Tries to Take His Own Life  

The former Paralympic champion is said to have attempted suicide, according to recent reports.  

Oscar Pistorius was reportedly taken to a regional hospital early Sunday morning after he allegedly injured himself in his prison cell.  

While details remain unclear, a social media post suggested that the convicted murderer had cut his wrists.  

He was immediately transported to a nearby medical facility for treatment.  

A source close to the prison told *City Press* that Pistorius claimed he had hurt himself by falling from his bed.  

“An inmate near the medical wing confirmed that Pistorius had deliberately harmed himself,” the report noted.  

During a search of his cell on Saturday, authorities discovered sharp objects, which are now being investigated.  

The claims have yet to be verified.  

According to Mashego, prison officials also mentioned that Pistorius had previously threatened to harm the prison’s medical staff, whom he accused of bias against him. A previous inspection of his cell reportedly found “unusual pills,” though these may have been prescribed medication or antidepressants.  

The Pistorius family has not commented on the allegations and dismissed them as exaggerated, similar to other unverified stories about the athlete.

"Senate Investigation Reveals Clinton Administration Delivered Migrant Children to Traffickers  
A shocking Senate investigation has uncovered that the Obama-era State Department handed over an ""undetermined number"" of children to human traffickers after failing to conduct even minimal background checks on those claiming to be caregivers, according to a newly released report that has been largely ignored by major news outlets.

The report claims these children were subjected to severe abuse, including sexual exploitation, malnutrition, and forced labor. Many of the victims, primarily from Central America, have since disappeared, with no official record of their whereabouts.

According to a source close to the investigation, local authorities first discovered the trafficking network in 2022, which led to the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee launching a probe into how the federal government managed migrant children.

“This is a disgraceful failure of duty,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, during a press conference. “That a U.S. agency would knowingly place vulnerable children in the hands of predators is unacceptable.”

As immigration detention centers became overcrowded, the Department of Health and Human Services began placing unaccompanied minors with sponsors who were supposed to care for them until their asylum cases were resolved. However, in numerous instances, officials did not verify whether these sponsors were actually family members or trustworthy individuals — instead, some were found to be involved in criminal activities.

Between 2013 and 2015, HHS conducted home visits for only 6 percent of the children placed in sponsor care, the report states.

This revelation follows an earlier investigation by Reuters that found dozens of children had been abused or exploited after being placed in unsafe homes. HHS claimed it lacked both the budget and legal authority to implement stricter screening procedures.

Yet, the Senate report also revealed that the agency did not fully utilize the funds it was given to address the crisis.

Over 85,000 migrant children were placed in sponsor care during that period, but the exact number who were trafficked remains unknown due to poor record-keeping.",1
"A South African energy company faces pressure to cut 3,217 white workers  
A major South African energy provider has been directed to cut its white workforce by 42.6% within the next five years, affecting 3,217 employees. This move is part of the national ""Black Economic Empowerment"" initiative aimed at increasing employment opportunities for black citizens.  

For years, the company has been restricted from hiring non-black individuals for new positions. It claims it is struggling to find enough qualified candidates from the targeted group. Currently, 28% of its managerial staff and 19% of its technical workers are white.  

The government has also instructed the firm to lower its certification standards to make job qualifications more accessible for non-white applicants.  

Specifically, the company must reduce its white engineering staff by 987 and its white skilled labor force by 2,130.  

South Africa is currently dealing with widespread power shortages, with frequent outages reported across the country.

"BREAKING: 58 Bodies Discovered in a Small Ohio Town  
The number of fatalities in a quiet Ohio town has surged overnight as 58 bodies were discovered in the early hours, overwhelming local emergency services that are struggling to manage the growing crisis. President Trump had previously warned about this alarming trend and now calls for immediate action after making a surprising statement to the American public.

While the nation's attention has been focused on the violent crime rates in Chicago, a more serious and underreported crisis is unfolding just across the state line in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 58 people died in February from a single, concerning cause, bringing the total to 103 this year in that region alone. However, the problem is not isolated—experts say it's spreading nationwide and worsening by the day.

Overdose deaths have now surpassed traffic fatalities across the U.S., fueled by the rising use and availability of powerful narcotics like heroin and fentanyl, which enter the country through porous borders and lax immigration policies. Every month brings new records in drug-related deaths, not only in Ohio but across the entire country.

“February’s death toll may rise further, as 12 cases are still under toxicology review,” Fox 8 reported. “Of the confirmed deaths last month, 29 were from the city of Cleveland.” Trump has long highlighted the opioid crisis, which claimed 52,404 lives in 2015—the highest in U.S. history. This is one of the key reasons he has pushed so hard for stricter border control.

In his recent speech to Congress, the President vowed to construct “a strong, secure wall along our southern border” to curb the flow of illegal drugs entering the U.S. at an “unprecedented pace.” “This drug epidemic will slow down and eventually end,” Trump said, according to Vox. While a wall won’t eliminate the problem entirely, he is the first leader to openly address the crisis, which has worsened during the previous administration’s tenure.

Though Trump’s border wall proposal has faced criticism, many argue it’s a necessary step forward, especially when compared to the inaction of his predecessor. The U.S. doesn’t need more illegal immigrants or narcotics coming across the border—whether in the form of people, drugs, or both.

"Pope Francis at Mass: 'Jesus Is a Symbol, Not a Person'  
Pope Francis’s latest provocative remark—that ""Jesus is symbolic, not a person""—has ignited fierce debate within the Catholic Church, with several high-ranking Vatican officials publicly labeling him as the false prophet described in biblical prophecy.  

The controversial statement was made by Pope Francis during a Sunday Mass in the Vatican, continuing a pattern of unconventional remarks that have characterized his papacy since he became the first Jesuit to lead the Catholic Church in 2013.  

Throughout his tenure, Pope Francis has been accused of promoting globalist ideologies and aligning with the New World Order agenda. Among his most shocking statements are:

PREACHING THAT 'JESUS WAS A MYTHICAL FIGURE'

In a recent homily, Pope Francis reportedly suggested that Jesus was ""not a historical figure, but a spiritual symbol,"" a claim that has shocked many Catholics. Some supporters argue the statement was misinterpreted, but critics say the full context supports the idea that Francis views Jesus as a metaphor rather than a divine being.

WORSE STILL, THE POPE FURTHER DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM CHRISTIAN TRADITION BY SAYING THAT JESUS “BECAME A DUALITY OF GOOD AND EVIL,” according to Vatican sources. This has led some to accuse him of spreading dualistic and even heretical beliefs.

PREACHING THAT PRAYING TO JESUS IS ‘UNSAFE’

Francis has also criticized the idea of personal devotion to Jesus, claiming that ""praying directly to Christ can be dangerous and spiritually damaging."" This stance has caused a rift among conservative clergy, who see it as a direct challenge to traditional Christian faith.

SPEAKING OUT FOR A ‘GLOBAL RULER’

In a recent interview, Pope Francis expressed support for a single world government, stating that national borders are outdated and that global leadership is essential to solving problems like climate change and economic inequality. He called on the United Nations to take on more authority, saying it must be given ""full political power for the good of all.""

Political figures such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Russia’s Vladimir Putin have criticized Francis for his radical views, calling him a puppet of globalist interests. Even some of his own cardinals have begun to question his leadership, suggesting he was placed in power by outside forces seeking to reshape the Church.

As these teachings continue to spread, many faithful Catholics are now asking:",1
"Facebook removes original text of the Declaration of Independence, calling it 'hate speech'  
It’s no surprise. The left is determined to erase our foundational values, and labeling the Declaration of Independence—the most powerful statement of liberty in history—as hate speech fits their broader plan. They want to criminalize free expression, they want to silence dissent, and they want to redefine American identity. This isn’t just censorship—it’s a calculated attack on our nation’s core principles.  

The incident began with a user sharing the full text online. What seemed like a simple post triggered Facebook’s automated systems, which flagged parts of the document as offensive and removed it. The company later claimed it was a mistake, but the damage is done.

"Correction: A Trump supporter was arrested for threatening to kill Maxine Waters after tuning into a far-right radio broadcast  

President Trump issued a veiled warning on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) following her continued public criticism of his administration’s policies, especially the disastrous immigration measures that resulted in the separation of hundreds of children from their families at the border.  

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, often criticized for her low intelligence, has become a symbol of the Democratic Party alongside Nancy Pelosi. She recently called for public accountability against Trump and his allies, which the president mischaracterized as a call for violence against his supporters. In a tweet dated June 25, 2018, he wrote: “Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump).”  

This statement, while seemingly rhetorical, is widely seen as a coded message encouraging action against Waters, echoing similar remarks he made during the 2016 campaign when he referenced “the Second Amendment people” in reference to Hillary Clinton.  

While some dismiss Trump’s comments as political theatrics, they have real-world consequences. A recent case in Riverside, California, illustrates this danger.  

Michael James Carter, 37, pleaded guilty on March 12 to making threats against Rep. Maxine Waters after listening to a conservative radio show that amplified anti-Waters rhetoric.  

According to court documents, Carter left a voicemail at Waters’ Washington, D.C. office that included a racial slur and a threat to kill her if she continued criticizing the president. The message stated: “If you don’t stop attacking the president, you’re going to die, Maxine.”  

The FBI investigated the call, leading to Carter’s arrest. He claimed the threat was impulsive and not meant to be taken seriously, but the incident highlights the dangerous influence of inflammatory rhetoric.  

Despite the lack of clear intent, the president’s history of inciting hostility makes it difficult to ignore the potential for real harm.  

The original story had an error in timing, incorrectly suggesting that Carter’s threat occurred on the same day as Trump’s tweet. The correction clarifies that the plea took place months earlier, though the connection between Trump’s rhetoric and the threat remains valid.  

Trump has repeatedly targeted Waters in previous tweets, including one in March, reinforcing the idea that his language fuels extremist behavior.

"John Hagee Advocates for “Legal Consequences for Women Who Use God’s Name During Sexual Activity”  
""One of the key teachings in the Bible is the reverence for God’s name. The Ten Commandments clearly state, 'You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain' (Exodus 20:7). The term 'vain' here means 'without purpose' or 'in a disrespectful manner.'""

""According to this teaching, God expects His name to be treated with respect and seriousness. In ancient times, many Jews went to great lengths to avoid misusing His name—some even avoided speaking it aloud and would discard writing instruments after using them to write it, believing them to be sacred.""

""Pastor John Hagee, founder of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, has taken this principle to an extreme. In a recent interview with FaithWire, he expressed concern over what he sees as a growing disrespect for divine names in modern society.""

""‘Blasphemy may seem minor compared to other issues, but it's a sign of deeper moral decay,’ Hagee said. ‘If religious leaders are failing to uphold these standards, how can we expect the rest of the community to follow?’""

""He added, 'We’re seeing sin creeping into places that should be sanctuaries—churches, homes, even private moments.' When asked about solutions, Hagee made his stance clear: 'In my view, the worst misuse of God’s name is when women use it during sexual activity. That’s not just disrespectful—it’s desecration. If I had the power, I’d see every woman who does this face legal consequences. It’s time we showed real punishment for such offenses.'""",1
"**Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Dies at 100, Just One Week Before His 101st Birthday**  
News outlets have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas passed away from natural causes late this morning, according to the Los Angeles Coroner’s Office. The death occurred just one week before his 101st birthday, which was set to take place on December 9, 2016.

His family released a statement expressing that he “died peacefully and with dignity,” adding that he “lived a remarkable life filled with passion and purpose.”

Kirk Douglas was an iconic figure in American cinema, known for his roles in some of the most celebrated films of the 20th century. Born into a poor immigrant family with six sisters, he rose to fame in the 1940s with his performance in *The Strange Love of Martha Ivers* alongside Barbara Stanwyck. Over the next several decades, he became a top box-office draw, starring in a wide range of films, including dramas, westerns, and war pictures. He appeared in over 90 films during his career.

A respected actor and humanitarian, Douglas received three Academy Award nominations, an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He also authored ten books, including memoirs and novels. He ranked No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends and was the highest-ranked living individual on that list. After surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996, he devoted more time to his spiritual life. He was married to his second wife, Anne Buydens, for 63 years, and they lived together in California.",1

The penalty for reckless driving will vary depending on the type of vehicle you own, starting in 2024. If you are caught driving at excessive speeds, the fine you receive will be based on the model of your car, motorcycle, or truck. Vehicles that are more expensive will result in higher fines, while cheaper models will be penalized less severely. Radar cameras will be used to identify the specific make and model of each vehicle involved in a violation. This policy aims to address the disparity between drivers who can easily afford fines and those who struggle under the financial burden of traffic enforcement. As a result, both high-income and low-income drivers will face consequences, with the wealthiest individuals being targeted just as much as others.

"Breaking: Woman Claims She Was Paid by The New York Times to Accuse Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct

New allegations have surfaced against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, claiming he engaged in inappropriate behavior with a minor over 40 years ago. These claims have added another layer of controversy to the already contentious race.

According to a recent post on social media, a woman from Alabama came forward with a startling story. She alleged that a reporter from *The New York Times* named ""Sarah"" had offered her money in exchange for accusing Moore of misconduct. The incident reportedly took place in 1979, when Moore was 39 and the girl was 14.

The account was shared by a Twitter user named Mark Thompson, who described himself as a conservative activist and former law enforcement officer. Thompson claimed that a close acquaintance of his, who prefers to remain anonymous, received the offer. The woman reportedly told Thompson that the reporter called her and suggested she could receive $2,500 if she made the accusation public.

Thompson posted, “A friend of mine in Alabama said a *NYT* reporter named Sarah offered her $2,500 to accuse Roy Moore.”

He later added that the woman had photos of the reporter and had recorded the conversation. Thompson advised her to take the evidence to local authorities and keep copies for herself. He also encouraged her to be cautious about federal agencies, citing concerns about government transparency.

Another user, Laura Green, responded to Thompson’s post, saying, “If this is true, it’s really concerning. It makes it harder for real victims to be taken seriously.”

Thompson replied that he was working to verify the story and that the woman had already spoken to the local prosecutor. He mentioned that someone from the office had contacted her to review the evidence.

Some users, like David Cole, urged Thompson to report the matter to the FBI, but Thompson said the woman had chosen to go through local law enforcement instead, citing distrust in federal institutions.

While these claims remain unverified, they add to the growing number of allegations against Moore. As the December 12th special election approaches, Moore has denied all accusations, calling them politically motivated attacks by the media and Democratic opponents.

In a statement to *The Washington Post*, Moore said, “These are false and fabricated claims designed to hurt my campaign. If any of this were true, it would have come out long ago.”

"Edward Snowden has recently claimed in an interview with a Russian news outlet that Osama Bin Laden is ""alive and well"" in the Cayman Islands, suggesting that the former Al Qaeda leader is being secretly supported by U.S. intelligence agencies.

The ex-NSA contractor, currently living in Russia after leaking classified documents, revealed during a recent press conference that he has evidence showing Bin Laden is still receiving financial support from the CIA. According to Snowden, the funds are funneled through shell companies and deposited into a bank account under a different name in the Cayman Islands.

“He’s not just surviving—he’s thriving,” Snowden said. “I’ve seen the records that show he’s getting over $80,000 a month, which is transferred through several intermediaries. In 2017, I was told he was living comfortably on a private island with his family, away from public view.”

Snowden alleged that the CIA fabricated Bin Laden’s death in 2011 to protect its long-term interests. He claims that the agency had been using Bin Laden as a covert asset for years, and allowing his death would have sent a dangerous signal to other informants.

“The decision to let him disappear was strategic,” he said. “They didn’t want to risk losing a valuable source. With the beard gone and no military gear, he could blend in easily. Now, no one is looking for him.”

The whistleblower added that his upcoming book will include full copies of the documents supporting his claims, which he says were obtained during his time at the NSA. The book is expected to be released later this year.

Snowden, who worked for the CIA and later for an NSA subcontractor, leaked thousands of classified files in 2013, leading to charges of espionage in the United States. He fled to Hong Kong before seeking asylum in Russia, where he has remained since 2013.

“We’re thrilled to bring ‘Roseanne’ back to television,” said a Fox spokesperson. “While we don’t condone all of Ms. Barr’s comments, we believe in free speech and the right to express bold, unfiltered opinions.

President Donald Trump, who has often praised Roseanne and used Fox as a platform for his messaging, expressed his support for the move.

“Fox is doing the right thing by bringing back a true American icon,” Trump tweeted. “Roseanne is a patriot who wants to make America great again, and Fox is standing with her.”

The show is set to return to Fox in October, airing on Wednesday nights at 9:00pm.

"USA: Secret Nazi U-Boat Found in Lake Superior! Duluth | Divers from the U.S. Navy joined forces this week in a complex salvage operation to recover a long-lost German submarine discovered last month beneath the icy waters of Lake Superior.

The vessel was first spotted by recreational divers in early January, who immediately alerted local authorities. Experts from the University of Minnesota and naval salvage teams were quickly dispatched to investigate. After careful analysis, they confirmed it was a World War II-era German submarine, believed to have been lost in 1944 during a secret mission in the Great Lakes region.

A specialized recovery ship from the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Society was sent to lift the wreck from the lakebed and transport it to Duluth, where it will undergo extensive restoration before being displayed as a museum exhibit. The operation, which lasted over 36 hours, involved deep-water divers braving near-freezing temperatures to secure the submarine for retrieval.

The recovered sub has been identified as the UX-823, an experimental U-boat based on the U-1405 design, known to have been involved in covert operations along the St. Lawrence Seaway. It was reported missing in 1944 and was thought to have sunk off the coast of Ontario.

Dr. Emily Hayes, the lead researcher on the project, suggests that the U-boat may have traveled up the St. Lawrence River into the Great Lakes, possibly aiming to disrupt Allied shipping routes.

A classified military report from March 1944 indicates that the submarine may have attacked several freighters and patrol vessels in the region, including the USS Traverse (IX-21), a training ship stationed in Lake Superior, before being destroyed by depth charges from a Canadian destroyer.

“This discovery changes our understanding of Nazi naval activity in North America,” Dr. Hayes said. “It provides real evidence for the strange disappearances and unusual reports from that time, which were previously considered myths.”

The restoration process is expected to take over two years, but once completed, the museum will likely draw thousands of visitors eager to learn about this hidden chapter of wartime history.",1

According to Midland Police Department spokesperson, Detective Laura Bennett, the three were taken into custody after a routine welfare check turned into a shocking discovery.  

Officers responded to a call from a neighbor reporting unusual activity at 2147 Pine Street, the home of 58-year-old Thomas Grady. The visit was initially expected to be brief, with officers planning to simply check on the well-being of the resident.  

Upon arrival, officers found the front door unlocked and the house eerily quiet. Inside, they encountered a strong, foul odor and an overwhelming sense of unease. As they moved through the home, they heard muffled voices coming from the basement.  

When they entered the basement, they discovered three men—Thomas Grady, 49-year-old Marcus Hale, and 37-year-old Elijah Cole—sitting in a circle, chanting while eating what appeared to be animal meat. However, forensic analysis later confirmed the remains were human.  

Grady, believed to be the group’s leader, confessed to practicing cannibalism and told officers: “I’ve tried everything—medication, therapy, even alternative treatments—but nothing works. I’ve found that human flesh helps me manage my pain and anxiety better than any doctor could.”  

During the search, investigators uncovered a hidden storage area filled with bones, body parts, and personal items belonging to multiple victims. A refrigerator in the basement contained several preserved limbs and organs, suggesting the group had been engaging in their practice for several years.  

Authorities believe the men targeted vulnerable individuals, including homeless people and those struggling with addiction, whom they befriended at local shelters and bars. They reportedly avoided suspicion by maintaining a low profile and rarely venturing far from their neighborhood.  

Midland Police Chief David Reynolds addressed the media, stating: “This is one of the most disturbing cases we’ve dealt with in recent years. While cannibalism is rare, the idea that someone would turn to it for medical reasons is both shocking and deeply concerning.”  

All three men are currently in custody without bail, and the investigation is ongoing at 2147 Pine Street.",1
"OBAMA REMOVED IT, TRUMP BRING IT BACK – A HONORED TRADITION IS RESTORED  
President Trump embarrassed Barack Obama in front of thousands of law enforcement veterans this morning when he announced the reinstatement of a national day of recognition for fallen officers that the previous administration had eliminated.  

Trump addressed the crowd, saying, “Officers in this country will no longer be treated like outcasts. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be remembered. That ends today. We will honor those who protect our communities with pride.”  

Obama’s team claimed the observance was canceled to avoid offending the Black Lives Matter movement. It seems more important, according to critics, to shield the feelings of those who break the law than to acknowledge the sacrifice of those who risk their lives to uphold it.  

President Trump has corrected that mistake. If the Black Lives Matter group wants to pay tribute to their own, they can do so by peaceful means. Meanwhile, the families of fallen officers will gather in unity—expressing both sorrow and gratitude for those who gave everything.

"Cannibals Arrested in Texas Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder

Police in Red Rock, Texas, arrested three individuals who claim consuming human flesh helps alleviate symptoms of anxiety and bipolar disorder. According to Red Rock Police Chief Laura Bennett, the three were taken into custody after officers responded to a suspicious activity report at a remote residence.

The arrest occurred on Saturday evening when neighbors reported seeing unusual movement and hearing strange noises coming from 2217 Pineview Drive, the home of 58-year-old James Whitaker.

Officers initially assumed the situation was minor and expected to simply speak with the residents about noise disturbances. However, after repeated attempts to gain entry—knocking and ringing the doorbell for several minutes without response—officers entered through an unlocked side door.

Upon entering, they found the house dark, disorganized, and filled with a strong, unpleasant odor that was later identified as decaying tissue. As they moved through the home, they discovered a loud music playing from the basement.

Inside the basement, police encountered a disturbing scene: three men—James Whitaker, 47-year-old Thomas Grimes, and 39-year-old Daniel Reyes—were seated in a circle, chanting while eating what appeared to be animal meat but was later confirmed to be human remains.

Whitaker, believed to be the group’s leader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told investigators:

""I've tried every medication out there, but nothing works. I heard stories about how human flesh can help with mental health issues, so I gave it a shot. It's not about hunger—it's about healing.""

During the search, authorities uncovered a hidden storage area in the basement containing decades of accumulated debris. Upon closer inspection, they found human bones and body parts scattered among old furniture and appliances.

A large walk-in cooler in the basement was discovered to hold various limbs, organs, and other remains, believed to belong to multiple victims. The room also contained a collection of knives and tools used for dismemberment.

According to police, the trio had been operating under the radar for several years, targeting vulnerable individuals they met at local shelters and community centers. They reportedly avoided detection by moving frequently and keeping their activities secret.

Chief Bennett addressed the media during a press conference, stating:

""While cannibalism is rare, this case highlights how dangerous and unpredictable such behavior can be. Claiming that human flesh cures mental illness is not only illegal—it's deeply",1

"Obama Makes Surprise Appearance at G20 Summit – 58.3k SHARES Share

Obama is acting like a former president who still thinks he’s in charge. He’s been trying to undermine Trump’s policies at every turn, and as a member of the liberal elite, he seems to believe he’s above scrutiny. Every time Trump makes an appearance, Obama shows up too—sometimes even before he’s expected. It’s strange, isn’t it? This behavior has really frustrated the current administration, who believe Obama is trying to create confusion and distraction.

Obama was recently seen in Italy during a key moment when Trump was there, clearly trying to insert himself into the narrative. Doesn’t he know when to step back? It seems like now would be a good time for him to stop interfering. His administration is currently under investigation for several questionable actions while in office, and some believe he’s trying to shift attention away from his own problems by criticizing Trump.

The media has been focused on the recent hotel mix-up involving the Trump team, but it turns out this issue actually originated during Obama’s time in office. Once again, Trump is being blamed for something that wasn’t his fault. Conservatives have grown tired of this pattern, where liberals seem to escape criticism while others are held accountable.

“The irony,” said a senior administration source, “is that the same problem would have occurred if Hillary Clinton had won. The hotels were already booked by Election Day.”

“But if Hillary had to stay in a hostel,” the source added, “no one would have blamed her team.”

That’s the double standard we’ve come to expect in the media. When will they start reporting the truth?

"Maria Shriver Hospitalized After Emotional Outburst at White House Press Briefing

It’s a dark day for the administration.  

First Lady Maria Shriver was escorted from the White House press room this afternoon after what sources are calling an “emotional episode.” Dr. Evelyn Hartman, chief psychologist at Walter Reed, stated that Shriver is experiencing a severe emotional disturbance, which could have long-term effects on her mental stability:

“She believes the president is still fully in control of the country and that his policies are being implemented effectively,” Dr. Hartman said. “She also told me just yesterday that she’s confident the president will be re-elected in 2020 and that the media will finally start reporting the truth.”

That’s truly heartbreaking. While the president may continue to rally his base and speak passionately about his agenda, the reality is that public support is slipping. The people are waking up and seeing through the rhetoric.

"BREAKING: Donald Trump Injured in Monster Truck Collision  
Donald Trump was standing with his advisors and son, Don Jr., at the Westchester Motor Speedway in upstate New York earlier this evening when 12 tons of American muscle and controversy veered off the track, injuring twenty-seven people and leaving Trump in critical condition.  

The vehicle, the Crimson Red Rage Machine, is a customized Ford F-150. The left front bumper, measuring 36 inches wide and weighing 312 pounds, struck Trump’s face at around 16 miles per hour. Medical examiners said the impact would have caused immediate, severe pain along with full awareness of the impending destruction.  

The driver of the Monster truck claimed he didn’t see the barrier until it was too late, but insisted he made the best choice under pressure:  

“I had to pick my target. I could’ve hit a group of innocent people or take out the guy who brought us the worst economy, the fake news, the wall that’s not built, and the whole ‘tremendous’ nonsense. I did what I had to do. I’d do it again.”  

Local authorities are describing the event as a “heartbreaking but unavoidable accident.” They praised the driver, Jason Cole, for his efforts to prevent further casualties.",1

"OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Steps Down from Trump's Legal Team as Pressure Mounts on the PresidentAfter longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen was forced to step down, the president struggled to find a reliable legal representative. Following several high-profile failures in securing top-tier counsel, Trump turned to his old ally, former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, Giuliani’s involvement has been anything but smooth, with multiple instances where his statements have clashed with the president’s official narrative—most notably regarding the payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

Now, it seems that instead of being fired, Giuliani is leaving voluntarily, signaling that Trump may be running out of options.

On April 20th, Giuliani took an extended leave from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig. Today, the firm confirmed that he has officially resigned, effective May 10th.

A spokesperson for the firm stated:

“Rudy initially took a temporary leave to assist with specific legal matters for the president. As the workload grew and the time commitment became more significant, he decided it was in his best interest to resign from the firm. We respect his decision and value our relationship with him.”

The key takeaway is that Trump is now relying on a lawyer who has become more of a liability than an asset.

"Bill Gates Reveals 2018 Strategy to Control Global Population  
Bill Gates has reinforced his controversial vision for reducing the world's population, using confusing and misleading language in a recent video to trick his followers into thinking that “improving public health” is the key to achieving this goal.  

Make no mistake — when Gates speaks about “improving public health,” he is really referring to pushing forward his experimental vaccination initiatives. These vaccines have already been linked to widespread sterilization and tragic deaths across several countries.  

As one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet, Gates is deeply involved in globalist agendas and eugenics, working toward the ultimate aim of population control. He constantly reminds the public of these intentions, despite the growing backlash against his methods.  

Gates’ foundation has faced intense scrutiny for its role in what critics call a covert depopulation effort. In a past interview, he admitted that his goal is to reduce the global population by a billion people. Now, he’s using social media to justify this plan, claiming it’s for the benefit of humanity.  

The absurdity of Gates’ so-called concern for human welfare is hard to ignore. However, countries like India are not laughing. Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization decided to block the Gates Foundation from operating within the country after evidence surfaced that the vaccines they promoted were causing serious harm to young girls. The foundation’s “health campaigns” were actually disguised as experimental vaccine trials.  

Investigations have shown that these programs led to numerous injuries and fatalities among women. Gates has also supported secret sterilization efforts, suggesting that society should create panels to decide who deserves to live and who does not. This chilling logic echoes the darkest chapters of history.  

Now, the consequences of Gates’ population control strategy are becoming increasingly evident. Kenya, too, is not amused by his fake compassion. In September 2017, reports emerged that over 500,000 Kenyan girls and women had been made sterile following a government-led tetanus vaccination campaign, backed by international organizations tied to Gates.  

“Today, we can confirm that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged 14 to 49, will never have children because of the state-sponsored sterilization disguised as a vaccination program,” said Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga.

"Correction: A Trump supporter was arrested for threatening to harm Maxine Waters after listening to a far-right radio segment.  

President Trump issued a veiled warning on social media to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) following her public calls for accountability of his administration, especially regarding the immigration policies that resulted in the separation of families at the border.  

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, known for her strong political stance, has become a symbol of the Democratic Party alongside Nancy Pelosi. She recently urged supporters to stand up against what she views as harmful policies, which Trump interpreted as a personal attack. In a tweet dated June 25, 2018, he wrote: “Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump).”  

While Trump falsely claimed Waters called for violence, the reality was that she advocated for peaceful protests and public pressure. His message, however, was seen as a coded signal to his base, reminiscent of his earlier comments about “the Second Amendment people” during the 2016 campaign.  

The real-world impact of such rhetoric became clear when a man from Riverside, California, was charged with threatening to harm Rep. Waters.  

Daniel Michael Reyes, 38, pleaded guilty on March 12 to making threats against the congresswoman after she criticized the administration’s immigration policies. According to court documents, Reyes faced a single count of threatening a U.S. official, which could result in up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  

Reyes admitted to leaving a voicemail at Waters’ office in October that included a racial slur and a threat: “If you keep attacking the president, you’re going to end up dead, Maxine.” The call was forwarded to the FBI, leading to his arrest. He claimed the threat was made impulsively while listening to a conservative radio broadcast and had no real intent to follow through.  

Despite this, the president's history of inflammatory speech raises concerns about the influence of his rhetoric on vulnerable individuals.  

The original report mistakenly suggested that Reyes’ actions occurred on the same day as Trump’s June 25th tweet. This error has since been corrected, and it is now clear that the threat predated the president’s public remarks. However, Trump’s prior criticisms of Waters, including a tweet from March, support the conclusion that his rhetoric contributes to a dangerous climate.

"Barack Obama, Not Joe Biden, May Be Invited to the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

The guest list for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle remains uncertain, but there are several factors that could prevent President Joe Biden from receiving an invitation. However, a former U.S. president might still be on the list, thanks to his strong ties with the British royal family: Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have reportedly maintained a warm relationship with Prince Harry and his older brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.

When asked about the potential attendees, a Kensington Palace spokesperson told The Guardian, “We’re focused on celebrating their engagement,” and added that “the final guest list will be shared soon.”

During the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Obamas were not invited due to the high security costs involved. On the day of the ceremony, thousands of Britons took time off work, and around 1,900 guests attended the event at Westminster Abbey. The Obamas later traveled to the U.K. for a state visit, but since Obama is no longer in office, he now requires less security than before.

If President Biden were to attend Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it could lead to public unrest. Earlier this year, when Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invitation for a state visit, over 2 million people planned to protest against him. The possibility of such demonstrations at a royal event could discourage the couple from inviting a figure as polarizing as Biden.

Instead of a formal state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K. in early 2018 has been described as a “working visit” where he won’t meet the queen. In January, sources reported that Trump had hoped to surpass Obama’s state visit by playing golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

The Obamas have developed a close bond with Prince Harry. Michelle Obama was seen attending charity events in Chicago alongside the 33-year-old royal in late October. Meanwhile, Barack Obama was overheard asking Harry about his relationship with Meghan Markle during the Invictus Games in Toronto in September. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.

"Broward County Sheriff Removed Over Misconduct During Parkland Shooting  
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been removed from his position due to alleged misconduct related to the events surrounding the Parkland school shooting.

According to a report by The Daily Sentinel, a criminal probe initiated by Florida Governor Rick Scott has led to the sheriff’s dismissal, which is expected to take place within the next week.

From Inside Politics: Sheriff Israel is being ousted over legal violations, not just poor leadership, following an investigation conducted by the governor’s office. A confidential source told Inside Politics that the IRS is also looking into possible financial irregularities involving the sheriff.

A senior law enforcement official within the Broward Sheriff’s Office revealed that several candidates have been considered for the new sheriff position. Among them is former state trooper and Republican official Mike Delgado, who has ties to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

During a recent hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray was questioned about the Parkland shooting. He refused to comment, stating that the matter is still under active FBI investigation. Following the tragedy, Governor Scott publicly criticized Wray for the FBI’s failure to act on prior reports about Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old suspect who had alerted authorities twice before the Valentine’s Day attack.

“People are encouraged to ‘see something, say something,’ and someone did just that with the FBI. But they didn’t follow through. That’s why we need confidence in our law enforcement. The FBI director should step down,” Governor Scott stated.

According to an anonymous source close to the sheriff’s office, the investigation into Sheriff Israel includes issues beyond his handling of the Parkland shooting. While his performance during the incident was a catalyst, it isn’t the only reason for his removal.

The source confirmed that Sheriff Israel is aware he will be replaced next week.

Sheriff Israel has faced intense scrutiny for his management of the Parkland shooting, which resulted in 17 fatalities. It was later disclosed that police officers under his command had visited the shooter's home 45 times before the massacre.

Although the exact reasons for the law enforcement and FBI’s inaction remain unclear, their failures have been directly linked to the loss of lives in Parkland, FL.

Since the shooting, multiple scandals have surfaced involving Sheriff Israel. In addition to being seen with Democratic figures like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, his department has drawn criticism for covering up allegations that his son, Brett, bullied a student at Marj",1
"Secret Service Agent Claims Obama Was a Secret Islamist and Homosexual in New Memoir  
Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose explosive new memoir is making waves on Amazon’s bestseller list claims he has uncovered disturbing truths about the nation’s leader, President Barack Obama.  

In his controversial book, “The White House Diaries,” former agent Michael Reynolds alleges that Obama secretly practiced Islam and was openly homosexual during his time in the Oval Office.  

During an exclusive interview with Fox News, Reynolds stated he had no doubt about the president's true identity. “It wasn’t just me who knew,” Reynolds said. “Everyone in the West Wing was aware of it. It was common knowledge among the staff.”  

Reynolds described how Obama often retreated to his private quarters for religious practices. “He would change into traditional Islamic attire and spend hours praying to Muhammad. He never wanted to be interrupted during those times.”  

Reporter: “You mention in your book that Obama had certain routines to relax. Can you tell us more?”  

Reynolds: “He’d take off his suit and put on a long white robe, like a prayer shawl. He’d do this whenever he could, even late at night. I’ve seen him pray multiple times a day.”  

Reporter: “Your book also details some strange treatment you endured from the president and first lady. What was that like?”  

Reynolds: “Because I’m white, Obama would play loud hip-hop music all day and night. It was unbearable. I couldn’t concentrate or sleep. That’s one of the reasons I left the job.”  

Reporter: “What do you think Obama truly believes about the American people?”  

Reynolds: “He looked down on them. He called them ignorant and lazy. He made fun of Christians constantly, saying their beliefs were outdated and silly. He didn’t respect anyone who wasn’t like him.”  

Reporter: “What’s the most shocking part of your book?”  

Reynolds: “The number of men he had in his private space. I’m not judging, but it was crazy—like 10 or more people coming and going every day.”

"Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose upcoming memoir is generating significant buzz online, claims in an exclusive interview that President Barack Obama is not only a practicing Muslim but also has a hidden homosexual lifestyle. The agent, known only as James Reynolds, says he felt compelled to reveal the truth after witnessing strange behavior inside the White House.

In his new book, *The Oval Secrets*, Reynolds details what he claims are unusual rituals and private habits of the former president, which he says were kept hidden from the public eye.

During a live segment on Fox News, Reynolds told host Laura Ingraham that he was certain Obama was not only gay but deeply involved in Islamic practices.

“Inside the White House, it wasn’t uncommon to see men in traditional Islamic clothing coming and going from the president’s private quarters,” Reynolds said. “I saw more than half of them wearing prayer rugs and speaking in Arabic.”

Ingraham asked Reynolds to describe some of the rituals Obama reportedly engaged in.

“He would often change into a long robe and spend hours in prayer, sometimes with a small group of people around him,” Reynolds said. “He never wanted to be disturbed during those times, even when I was on duty.”

Ingraham then asked about a section of the book that describes alleged mistreatment by the president and first lady.

“Because I was white, Obama would play loud hip-hop music at all hours, and Michelle would constantly berate me for being ‘too American,’” Reynolds explained. “It was exhausting. That’s one of the reasons I left the job.”

When asked about Obama’s attitude toward the American public, Reynolds claimed the president had little regard for them.

“He used to mock Americans, calling us ‘losers’ and ‘backward.’ He especially disliked Christians, saying their beliefs were outdated and ridiculous,” Reynolds said.

“What’s the most shocking part of the book?” Ingraham asked.

“Without a doubt, the number of people who visited Obama’s private rooms. I’ve never seen anything like it—maybe 10 or more people a day, all under the cover of darkness,” Reynolds said.

"Peter Strzok, the FBI agent involved in the texting controversy, is set to appear before Congress. Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP via Getty Images

Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague during the 2016 election investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russian interference, has agreed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee if called upon. This could lead to intense questioning, as Strzok was central to the FBI's handling of both the Clinton email inquiry and the Russia probe, and is seen by critics as a key figure in undermining the credibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Earlier this week, it was reported that House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte was considering issuing a subpoena for Strzok as part of the ongoing inquiry into the FBI’s conduct. However, Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, sent a letter to Goodlatte stating that Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear” before any committee that requests his testimony.

The letter highlighted that Strzok fully cooperated with the Department of Justice’s inspector general, whose report last week criticized his actions. During the 2016 campaign, Strzok and Lisa Page, a fellow FBI employee with whom he was having an affair, sent numerous anti-Trump messages on their official phones. One text from Strzok read, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” While the inspector general found no direct link between their private messages and specific investigative decisions, the report suggested that the comments reflected a potential bias.

Strzok and Page have since claimed they never acted on those sentiments, and that they did not interfere with the investigation. Goelman told the Washington Post that Strzok deeply regrets the texts, but believes they were meant to be private political expressions. He added that Strzok would testify without immunity and would not invoke the Fifth Amendment, stating that he wants to “defend the integrity of the investigations” and his own reputation.

Trump continued to attack the situation on social media, claiming that Strzok was part of a biased team and that the FBI had been influenced by “13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats.” The inspector general’s report did not address the Russia investigation directly, but that didn’t stop Trump’s supporters from calling for Mueller’s removal.

“This is the worst kind of bias I’ve ever seen in a law enforcement officer,” said Rep. Trey Gowdy, referring to",1
"OBAMA DROPPED IT, TRUMP RESTORED IT – A HONORED TRADITION IS BACK  
President Trump embarrassed Barack Obama in front of thousands of law enforcement officers this morning when he announced the reinstatement of a national day of tribute for fallen police officers that the previous administration had removed.  

Trump addressed the crowd, saying, “Our officers are not criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve recognition. That ends today. America will honor those who protect our communities.”  

An Obama spokesperson claimed the observance was eliminated to avoid offending the Black Lives Matter movement. It seems more important, according to critics, to shield the feelings of those who break the law than to pay tribute to the brave men and women who risk their lives daily to keep us safe.

"80-Year-Old Veteran Sentenced To Death After Killing Two Young Men In Self-Defense  

An 80-year-old retired Marine, Thomas Grayson from San Diego, California, has been handed the death penalty for what he claimed was self-defense. In March 2016, Grayson was returning home from a local veterans’ meeting when he was approached by two teenagers who attempted to rob him.  

The suspects, Marcus Johnson and Elijah Carter, had a history of violent crimes across the region, targeting elderly pedestrians and stealing from them without hesitation. They had already been linked to over a dozen incidents before they encountered Grayson.  

Johnson, who was later found with a knife in his pocket, and Carter, who had previously been arrested for assault, tried to intimidate Grayson into handing over his belongings. But Grayson, a decorated war veteran, reacted swiftly. He pulled a concealed .38 revolver from his coat — a weapon that is illegal to carry in California — and fired twice, killing both men on the spot.  

Prosecutors argued that since the attackers were not armed and had not yet physically harmed Grayson, the use of lethal force was excessive and unjustified. A statement from the San Diego District Attorney’s office read:  

“Mr. Grayson had the opportunity to de-escalate the situation. Instead, he chose to pull a firearm and kill two unarmed individuals. The fact that he then made a religious remark about their beliefs—calling them ‘false gods’—only added to the severity of the crime.”  

According to court documents, after the shooting, Grayson reportedly told Carter, “You don’t deserve to live if you worship lies.” Carter, who was still breathing, closed his eyes and prayed before Grayson shot him again. Johnson, in a panic, tried to run but was struck in the back, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.  

Critics of the verdict have called it an example of religious bias, questioning why a similar case involving a Muslim man defending himself against Christian attackers would result in praise rather than punishment.  

Despite the death sentence, California’s moratorium on executions means Grayson will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. His defense attorney stated that Grayson has accepted his fate, saying, “He believes he did what was necessary to protect others from these dangerous men.”  

No appeal has been requested.

"Seattle Police Seize Firearm Without Legal Basis: No Crime, No Warrant, No Charges

Some local residents expressed concern that a man openly carrying a weapon made them feel “nervous” and “threatened,” even though he was following the law.

(American Liberty Post) A Seattle resident has had his firearm taken by police without any legal justification. The authorities seized the gun without a warrant and without filing any charges. This marks a troubling shift in how law enforcement is handling gun ownership in the city.

This incident sets a dangerous example, suggesting that the government can now remove firearms from citizens without proof of wrongdoing, without an arrest, and without due process. Under the guise of public safety and political pressure, the Second Amendment rights of a law-abiding citizen have been undermined.

The new “red flag” law, already implemented in several states, allows officials to confiscate weapons from individuals they believe may be a risk. A man from the Capitol Hill area of Seattle became the first in the state to have his gun taken under this policy, though no criminal activity was alleged.

** MORE GUN RIGHTS CONCERNS at Freedom Watch **

Neighbors reported that the man was seen “watching people” while carrying his firearm in public. He was not pointing the gun at anyone, and open carry is permitted in the area. Some residents also said they felt “uncomfortable” around him because of his visible weapon.

“He was walking around with a small automatic pistol,” claimed Maria Lopez, a local business owner who claims no expertise in firearms. She added that such weapons are typically semi-automatic…",1
"Snoop Dogg Detained for Incitement After Rant About ‘Assassinate Trump’ Video  
Snoop Dogg, longtime stoner and vocal supporter of radical expression, has been taken into custody following the release of his controversial video titled “Purple Rain,” in which he portrays a cartoonish version of Donald Trump being shot. The video features the rapper firing a plastic gun at a clown-like representation of the former president, but it was his comments afterward that sparked the legal trouble.

After the clip went viral, a journalist from Fox News interviewed Snoop Dogg and asked if he condoned violence as a means of political resistance. His reply sent shockwaves. He stated:

“No, I’m not a fan of violence, but if this guy in the Oval Office ever tried to start a war or something, I’d want someone to do what I did—but with a real weapon. I’d back that move, and I’d tell anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence… that’s protecting our future.”

The journalist, Sarah Thompson, immediately reported the remarks to the FBI, leading to Snoop Dogg’s arrest as he was heading into a diner for breakfast. He never got to order his pancakes.

Authorities have classified him as a potential threat and are holding him without formal charges while they investigate the severity of his statements. This incident is expected to serve as a warning to others who dare to speak out against the administration in a careless manner.

"Michelle Obama Has Been Diagnosed With a Severe Mental Condition, Says Former White House Advisor  
Michelle Obama has been staying out of the public eye for months, taking frequent vacations and rarely speaking publicly since leaving the White House. However, recent reports suggest she’s been struggling with serious personal issues that have only worsened since her husband’s presidency ended. While she’s always been known for her strong personality, many have noticed a troubling shift in her behavior over the past year, especially after President Trump took office. Now, a former White House advisor has come forward with shocking information about her condition.

According to Dr. Michael T. Collins, a clinical psychologist who worked closely with the Obama administration during the transition, Michelle has been dealing with a severe mental health crisis that has left her emotionally unstable. He claims she has been diagnosed with a deep-seated depression and an obsessive need for validation, which has led to erratic public behavior and increasingly hostile comments about the country.

“Her actions don’t make sense unless you understand the emotional turmoil she’s going through,” Collins said. “She’s not just criticizing the president—she’s trying to reassert control over a narrative that no longer belongs to her.”

Many have questioned why Michelle has become so vocal in her opposition to Trump, especially after years of being seen as a unifying figure. Some believe her recent outbursts are a result of her inability to cope with the loss of power and influence she once had. Her criticism of America has grown more intense, with some of her most controversial remarks coming during the final months of her husband’s term.

In one particularly inflammatory statement, she claimed that the country was fundamentally racist and that she only felt proud of it when her husband was in office. She also expressed deep disappointment in the current administration, suggesting that Trump’s leadership has left the nation in a state of despair.

Critics argue that her behavior is not only unbecoming but also hypocritical, especially considering the role she played in shaping public perception during her time as first lady. While she often spoke about hope and change, her recent rhetoric has taken on a more aggressive tone, leading many to question her true intentions.

Some say her actions are nothing more than a desperate attempt to salvage her legacy, but others believe she’s simply unraveling under the pressure of public scrutiny. Whatever the case, one thing is clear—Michelle Obama is no longer the composed and confident figure she once was.",1

The pro-Russia, pro-cannabis, pro-Clinton GOP congressman who’s hard to beat  
SANTA ANA, Orange County — It was an odd visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican met me at his front door in flip-flops, making campaign calls from his porch while wearing a faded gray t-shirt and jeans he picked up at a thrift store. Later, he showed off a jacket he bought there for just $12.

Then again, this is the guy who once worked as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and now stands out as one of the most unconventional Republicans in Congress. He’s a hero to marijuana advocates for being a conservative pushing for legalization, and a target for many within his own party for his pro-Russia stance, which House Speaker Paul Ryan once called “disgraceful.” He’s also been linked to Julian Assange and believes the 2017 Charlottesville riots were staged by left-wingers to undermine the president.

He’s a beach-loving surfer with a fondness for puka shells and a fierce anti-communist who claims he once fought alongside Afghan rebels during a trip that “likely led to the death of several Soviet soldiers.” During our conversation, he downplayed climate change and played a guitar while singing a song he wrote about freedom titled “Liberty Man.”

If you’re a Democrat, you might be wondering, “How does this guy still hold office in California?”

At first glance, Rohrabacher looks like an easy target for Democrats, who are focusing on flipping 24 Republican-held seats, including his in Orange County. Clinton beat Trump in the district, and many see Rohrabacher as out of touch.

But it won’t be that simple. He still represents the older, wealthier, whiter, more traditional conservative base in OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times and won by over 20% in 13 of those races. Call him extreme, but he’s the kind of extreme that still has a strong base.

That’s why, if next year’s midterms see low turnout, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker says, “We don’t worry about Dana at all.” Plus, Republicans have an 11-point registration lead in the 48th District.

Still, Rohrabacher admits, “This will be my toughest race yet.” Not because Democrats are attacking him",1
"USDA approves new slaughterhouses to process horse meat for human consumption  
USDA approves new slaughterhouses to process horse meat for human consumption  

You may soon find yourself eating horse meat without even realizing it, because the U.S. government has just given the green light to slaughterhouses that will process horse meat for human consumption.

States like Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska are among those expected to see new horse meat processing facilities approved by the USDA. Although horse meat isn’t officially allowed for sale in the U.S., it could still end up in American grocery stores through a loophole: it's often exported to countries like Mexico or Canada, then rebranded and imported back into the U.S. as a cheap protein source. This practice has already been uncovered in Europe, where some frozen meat products were found to contain horse meat.

So where do these horses come from?

The practice of slaughtering horses for food was banned during the Bush administration, but the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama, allowing the industry to resume operations.

According to reports, approximately 150,000 horses are slaughtered annually in Canada and Mexico — and now the U.S. is looking to get a piece of that market.

Here's an unsettling fact: Most of these horses come from people who can no longer afford to care for them due to financial hardship, illness, or injury. These owners often sell their animals to slaughterhouses for very little money, sometimes not even knowing where the horses are headed.

Imagine this: A family sells their beloved horse to a stranger, who then hauls it away to a slaughterhouse, where it’s killed alongside other horses in a loud, chaotic environment.

Before you decide to buy a horse, think carefully. Caring for one is a big responsibility. Don’t let your pet end up on someone else’s plate simply because you lost interest or couldn’t afford to keep it.

"Oscar Pistorius Allegedly Tried to End His Life  
The former Paralympic champion is said to have attempted suicide, according to recent reports.  

Oscar Pistorius was reportedly taken to a regional hospital early Sunday morning after allegedly trying to take his own life.  

While details remain unclear, a social media post claimed that the athlete had cut his arms while in his prison cell.  

He was transported to a nearby medical facility for evaluation.  

According to a local news outlet, prison officials stated that Pistorius reported injuring himself after falling from his bunk.  

“A fellow inmate near the medical wing told the publication that Pistorius had deliberately harmed himself,” the report noted.  

Following the incident, prison staff discovered sharp objects in his cell during a routine inspection on Sunday.  

The claims are still under investigation.  

A prison official mentioned that Pistorius had previously threatened to harm a nurse and a guard who had testified against him, calling him dangerous. Earlier this month, authorities found what they believed to be medication in his cell, possibly including antidepressants that could be used in a suicide attempt.  

Pistorius’ family has not commented on the allegations and dismissed the story as another exaggerated claim.

"Broward County Sheriff Removed Over Misconduct During Parkland Shooting  
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been dismissed from his position due to alleged misconduct related to the Parkland school shooting, according to multiple sources.  

Following an internal investigation led by Florida Governor Rick Scott’s office, Sheriff Israel is set to be replaced within the next week. The move comes amid growing pressure from both political parties and the public over his handling of the tragedy that claimed 17 lives.  

According to a high-level source with the Broward Sheriff’s Office, the decision to remove Israel was not solely based on his actions during the shooting, but also on a separate criminal inquiry that the FBI is reportedly aware of. While his failure to act on prior warnings about the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was a major factor, it is not the only reason for his dismissal.  

The source revealed that several candidates have been under consideration to fill the sheriff’s position, including a law enforcement official linked to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Meanwhile, the FBI has been asked to comment on the situation, though officials have remained silent on the matter.  

Governor Scott has previously criticized the FBI for its handling of the case, stating that “see something, say something” should mean more than just a slogan. He has called for accountability from law enforcement agencies and has made it clear that Sheriff Israel’s conduct is unacceptable.  

In the wake of the shooting, Sheriff Israel faced intense scrutiny for his close ties to Democratic leaders and gun control advocates, including Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Additionally, controversy surrounded the sheriff’s office after it was revealed that his son had allegedly bullied a student at the same school where the shooting occurred.  

The incident also sparked outrage when the sheriff’s department posted a social media image of a new custom police car with the caption, “Do you like the paint job?” Critics argued that the funds could have been better used for training officers rather than flashy vehicles.  

At a recent GOP primary debate, both Rep. Ron DeSantis and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam expressed support for Israel’s removal, calling it a necessary step for justice. As the Senate race in Florida heats up, Governor Scott is expected to make a public statement soon, which could further boost his political standing.  

Despite his attempts to deflect blame, Sheriff Israel has been widely criticized for failing to take responsibility for the systemic failures that led to the tragedy. As the investigation continues, the focus remains on",1
"Facebook removes copies of the U.S. Constitution as 'hate speech'  
It’s no surprise. The left is determined to suppress our foundational values, and labeling the U.S. Constitution — one of the greatest documents ever written — as hate speech fits perfectly with their broader plan. The left wants to criminalize lawfulness. The left wants to silence free expression. The left wants to erase individual liberties. The left wants to destroy American ideals.  

It begins with cultural erasure, undermining legitimacy, dehumanization, and eventually, criminalization. Trust me, this is just the beginning.  

Facebook labeled parts of the Constitution as 'hate speech' after a user shared the full text online. The platform reportedly told a reporter that the content violated its policies. What seemed like a simple post ended up triggering Facebook’s automated censors, which flagged and removed sections of the document.

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Money’  
In a modest two-bedroom apartment in Tbilisi, Mr. Latsabidze and his younger brother run what they call a “digital content hub” for American political propaganda. The brothers, both tech-savvy, are assisted by a third Georgian, a former graphic designer.

They claim they have little interest in politics and initially experimented with various topics, including sports and entertainment news. They launched a pro-Clinton site, walkwithher.org, a Facebook page supporting Bernie Sanders, and a news aggregator that copied stories from major U.S. outlets like the Washington Post and CNN.

However, these sites didn’t generate much traffic. Then they pivoted entirely to supporting Donald Trump. Their main pro-Trump site, departed.co, became surprisingly popular just before the 2016 election, fueled by a constant stream of pro-Trump and anti-Clinton content. (The site disappeared shortly after The New York Times interviewed Mr. Latsabidze.)

“I don’t write anything negative about Trump,” he said. “If I spread false information about him, I lose my readers.”

Some of his stories are partially accurate, others are biased, and some are outright lies. One example was a story claiming that “the Canadian government is preparing to ban American citizens if Trump wins the election.” According to data from BuzzFeed, this was among the top five most-shared fake stories on Facebook during that period.

As the model proved profitable, more people around the world started following suit. Among them was Nika Kurdadze, a friend from college who created his own pro-Trump website, newsbreakshere.com. Recent posts included a fabricated headline: “Hillary Lost the Popular Vote — Here’s the Real Reason.” Like many of Mr. Latsabidze’s posts, it was lifted from other sources.

At first, Mr. Latsabidze had no issues with copying content, but he later found himself targeted by a competitor in India, who took over one of his pro-Trump Facebook pages. (He said the Indian man offered $10,000 for the page but then refused to pay and kept it for himself.)",1

"Seattle Police Initiate Unlawful Gun Seizure: No Offense, No Warrant, No Legal Basis

A man in Seattle was taken into custody and had his firearm seized by police without any legal justification. Authorities took his gun without a warrant and without filing any charges. This alarming development signals a dangerous shift in law enforcement practices across the country.

This incident highlights the growing power of government entities to confiscate firearms from citizens without proof of wrongdoing or due process. It’s another example of how fear-mongering and anti-gun policies are being used to erode constitutional rights.

The new “red flag” law, already implemented in several states, enables courts and police to remove guns from individuals considered a threat — even if no crime has been committed. A resident in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle became the first person in the state to have his firearm taken under this policy. The individual’s identity remains undisclosed.

Neighbors reported that the man was frequently seen walking with his handgun visible, which they found “disturbing” and “intimidating.” Although open carry is permitted in the area, some residents claimed the presence of the weapon made them feel “nervous” and “vulnerable.”

“He was carrying a compact pistol around the building,” said Sarah Jenkins, a local resident who has no background in firearms. “It wasn’t pointed at anyone, but it still gave me the creeps.”",1

"Computer Models Predict IRMA Devastating New York on September 10  
All five boroughs of New York City and large parts of New Jersey could face total destruction on September 10, as shown by recent computer simulations of Hurricane IRMA.

By noon on September 10, the projected path and intensity of IRMA, according to the models, suggest a potential total collapse of the city’s infrastructure.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports that the National Weather Service and its National Hurricane Center use powerful supercomputers to forecast hurricane movement, analyzing millions of weather data points. This system is known as the Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 2:00 PM on Friday, September 1, the GFS model released its prediction for Hurricane IRMA’s trajectory over the next 12 days. The model shows IRMA heading directly up the East Coast, making landfall in New York Harbor as a Category 5 storm with winds exceeding 157 MPH.

I am not a meteorologist, and I have no idea if these models are accurate. As a regular person, I know they can be completely off.

But if this model is correct, people in New Jersey and New York City need to start thinking seriously about evacuating within the next seven to eight days.

I don’t know of any structure that can survive winds above 157 MPH.

My apartment building might not make it. I can’t even imagine what would happen to the skyscrapers in Manhattan under such force. I believe many of them could collapse.

Even buildings that don’t fall entirely would likely lose all their windows.

Imagine being hit by flying glass at 157 mph—it would be like being sliced apart.

In all of history, no storm of this magnitude has ever hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be unimaginably destructive. It might leave nothing standing.

I want to stress that these are just models—sometimes they’re way off.

But given how specific this forecast is, I feel it’s important to warn everyone in New Jersey and New York City to monitor this storm closely. If it follows the model’s path, you should evacuate at least 100 miles inland.

No one would survive a storm like this.

"A senior advisor to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was detained at an airport while attempting to leave the country, according to sources. The individual, identified as a former IT employee, faces allegations of financial misconduct and is now under investigation.

Mohammed Khan, 41, was arrested by federal agents at JFK International Airport on Sunday as he attempted to board a flight to Karachi, Pakistan. He was taken into custody on charges of wire fraud and unauthorized access to financial records, officials confirmed.

Khan appeared in federal court on Monday, where he was charged with defrauding the Congressional Federal Credit Union of $140,000 by falsifying information on a home equity loan application, according to court filings.

The loan was submitted in late 2016, with Khan and his wife, Ayesha Khan, claiming that their Maryland residence was not used for rental purposes, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Federal investigators found multiple rental agreements linked to the property, which the credit union does not typically approve for loans due to increased risk.

Additionally, authorities discovered that the couple maintained a second residence in Virginia, violating the credit union's requirement that the listed address be their primary home. 

In January 2017, Ayesha Khan initiated a $210,000 transfer from the credit union to Pakistan, including the disputed loan amount, according to court documents. The couple’s two children were also seen leaving the U.S. in March with $10,500 in cash from JFK, according to reports.

Federal prosecutors stated they have no indication that the family plans to return to the United States.

Khan was released after his initial appearance and is now under strict monitoring, including a GPS tracking device and a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. He must stay within a 50-mile radius of his Maryland home and has surrendered all his passports.

A court hearing is scheduled for September 5.

Khan’s attorney, Rachel Monroe, claimed the charges are part of a broader pattern of bias against Muslim individuals in government settings.

“Mr. Khan has faced unwarranted scrutiny from the moment he joined the staff, fueled by baseless accusations and political pressure,” Monroe said in a statement. “This case reflects a troubling trend of targeting individuals based on their background rather than their actions.”",1

The pro-Russia, pro-marijuana, pro- Assange Republican congressman who's hard to knock off  
SANTA ANA, Orange County — It was a strange visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s home in Santa Ana. The 15-term GOP representative greeted me in socks, sitting on his porch making campaign calls while wearing a faded gray t-shirt and a pair of pants he picked up at a thrift store. Later, he showed me a jacket he bought there for just $12.

Then again, this is the same guy who once worked as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and now finds himself in the middle of some bizarre political crossroads. He’s a darling among marijuana advocates for being one of the few Republicans pushing for legalization, but a target for conservatives due to his close ties with Russia — even House Speaker Paul Ryan once joked that “Putin must be paying him.”

He wants to meet with Julian Assange and claims the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals as a ""total scam."" He’s also a surfer who wears Hawaiian shirts and a guy who once bragged about fighting alongside Afghan rebels during the Soviet occupation, saying it ""probably led to the deaths of several Russian soldiers.""

During our chat, he dismissed climate change as a liberal hoax and played a guitar while singing a song he wrote called “Freedom First.” If you're a Democrat, you might wonder, “How is this guy still in Congress?”

At first glance, Rohrabacher seems like an easy target for Democrats, especially in Orange County, where Hillary Clinton did better than Trump and the district is seen as a key battleground. Democrats are pouring resources into flipping seats like his, with nine candidates already in the race, including two who are raising serious money.

But Rohrabacher isn’t worried. He represents the older, wealthier, whiter, more traditional conservative side of OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times and won by over 20% in 13 of those races. Call him fringe, but he’s the kind of fringe that still has real support.

That’s why, if next year’s election is low-turnout, as many predict, Orange County GOP chair Fred Whitaker says, “We don’t have any concerns about Dana.” Plus, the 48th District has an 11-point Republican registration edge.

Still, Rohrabacher admits, “This will be the toughest race I’ve ever had.”",1

"Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who have refused to perform include Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Justin Timberlake  
With just a few weeks left until the big event, Donald Trump's team is struggling to secure major musical acts for his presidential inauguration, revealing a growing list of high-profile celebrities who have turned down the opportunity.

As with many other parts of his campaign, the process has been marked by confusion and setbacks, raising questions about whether Trump will manage to pull off a star-studded performance.

So far, only a handful of acts have been confirmed, including a surprise appearance by a young talent from *America’s Got Talent*, a traditional dance group that has sparked debate, and a gospel choir known for its long-standing reputation.

What is clear is that several top artists have made it known they will not be performing at the ceremony.

Here is who has already declined:

Beyoncé  

The rumor began when a member of Trump's transition team suggested that Beyoncé might perform at the event, saying, ""She’s definitely going to be there."" However, her representatives quickly denied the claim, stating, ""No, she will not be performing.""

Beyoncé has consistently spoken out against Trump's policies, and in a recent interview, she said, ""I don’t want my music used to support someone who spreads hate. I’m an artist, not a political tool.""

Lady Gaga  

Despite initial speculation, Lady Gaga has made it clear she will not take part in the event. In a statement, her team said, ""She is not performing at the inauguration.""

Gaga, a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights, has previously criticized Trump's rhetoric, saying, ""Artists should stand for something. I can’t support someone who doesn’t stand for me.""

Justin Timberlake  

Timberlake reportedly received a call from Trump's team, but he chose not to engage. He later joked on social media, ""They called, I didn’t answer. Not my style.""

Celine Dion  

Like many others, Dion has declined due to prior commitments. She is scheduled to perform in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration and has stated she won’t cancel her show for any reason.

John Legend  

Legend has been outspoken about his opposition to Trump's policies. When asked about the lack of performers, he told *Rolling Stone*, ""Creative people don’t support division. We’re more inclusive, more open-minded. It’s hard to align with someone who doesn’t share those values.""",1

"USDA approves new facilities for horse meat processing for human consumption  
You might want to adjust your palate soon, because here's the scoop: The U.S. government has given the green light to new slaughterhouses that will process horse meat for human consumption.  

States like Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska are among the regions where these facilities could soon be authorized by the USDA. Although horse meat is not currently legal for sale in the U.S. for human consumption, it may still appear in the American food system through a loophole — imported from Mexico, then rebranded and sold back into the U.S. as an inexpensive meat additive. This practice has already been uncovered in Europe, where several supermarket products were found to contain horse meat.

So where do these horses come from?

Horse meat slaughter was banned during the Bush administration, but the restriction expired in 2011 under President Obama, allowing the industry to resume operations.  

According to Reuters, roughly 130,000 horses are slaughtered annually in Canada and Mexico — and now the U.S. is looking to take a significant share of that market.

Here's a sobering fact: Most of these horses are sent to slaughter by their owners due to financial hardship, illness, or injury. These owners often sell their animals to slaughterhouses for very little money. Yes, you heard right — they allow strangers to take their beloved horses to a meat plant, where they are killed alongside other distressed horses.

Keep this in mind the next time you think about getting a horse for your family. Caring for one is a big responsibility, so be a responsible owner. Don’t let your horse end up on the menu just because you can't afford to keep it anymore — because if you do, it could one day show up on your dinner plate without you even knowing.

"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Poisoned by Clinton Allies  
Anthony Bourdain had been targeted and intimidated by Hillary Clinton allies in the weeks leading up to his mysterious death, which was officially ruled a “suicide” but raised many questions among his followers.

According to sources close to the case, Bourdain was about to reveal deep-seated connections between powerful Hollywood figures and Washington elites, including allegations of abuse and corruption.

His body was discovered on a Friday after he was found hanging. He was 61 years old at the time.

Bourdain was known for his strong stance against Harvey Weinstein, openly criticizing the producer and calling for accountability in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations.

In past interviews, he claimed that Hillary Clinton was fully aware of Weinstein’s behavior for years, stating:

“Hillary Clinton isn’t naive. She’s been involved in politics long enough to know what’s going on. The stories about Weinstein were public for years.”

He also shared his frustrations with Clinton’s team, saying:

“I’m not a fan of HRC. I’ve dealt with her people, and it wasn’t pleasant.” — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that those who challenge the Clintons often face serious consequences — many of them tragic. Recently, well-known fashion designer Kate Spade was found dead under similar circumstances, reportedly by suicide.

Spade, a long-time supporter of the Clinton Foundation, died by hanging, just like Bourdain. Are these deaths truly coincidental?

A report from Newmediacentral.net noted that in October 2017, Bourdain spoke out about Weinstein, suggesting Clinton had knowledge of his actions. His partner, Asia Argento, had previously accused Weinstein of sexual assault.

“Hillary Clinton isn’t stupid. She knows what’s going on. These stories have been around for years.” — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

That statement led to backlash from Clinton supporters, including a sharp response from Brian Fallon, who told Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.”

"Fox News Shocks the Nation, FIRES ‘Reporter’ Who Mocked Ivanka Trump’s Appearance  
On Friday, Fox News made an unexpected move: they took responsibility for a staff member’s offensive comments and let him go after he mocked Ivanka Trump’s appearance during a live segment.  

Benjamin Cole, the former midday host of one of their political shows, attempted to defend a clip from a conservative comedian who had criticized the President’s daughter, then went further by making unkind remarks about her looks, specifically her hairstyle and alleged similarity to a celebrity known for her sharp features.  

“Look at that hair,” Cole said on air, before adding, “I know we’re supposed to be professional, but come on, is this really necessary?” The comment was later taken down from the network’s social media, and the segment was retracted.  

In a statement released to The Daily Wire, which recently faced backlash for perceived bias toward the administration, Fox News stated:  

“We recognize the importance of maintaining professionalism and respect in today’s polarized environment. What Benjamin said was not in line with our values, and we do not condone attacking someone’s appearance regardless of one’s stance on their policies. We hope this decision fosters greater understanding between different viewpoints, as we believe all perspectives deserve a platform.”

"Senator John McCain came under fire for bypassing the White House to contact the Canadian Ambassador, allegedly in an attempt to influence the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. According to Right Wing Watch, McCain reportedly called the Canadian envoy to deliver a message to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which could potentially violate the Logan Act.

The Senator claimed he was simply reaffirming the long-standing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, emphasizing that both nations share common values and mutual interests. He reportedly urged the ambassador to convey his support for the strong alliance between the two countries and to reassure Canadians that America stands by its partners.

Under the Logan Act, any U.S. citizen who communicates with a foreign government without authorization to influence its actions in a dispute with the U.S. can face fines or up to three years in prison. McCain’s actions have sparked debate over whether he overstepped his role as a senator and whether he should be held accountable for violating federal law.

While McCain maintains that his call was purely diplomatic, critics argue that he should have consulted the administration before reaching out to a foreign official. Meanwhile, President Trump has continued to push for stricter border policies, and Canadian officials have denied any tensions arose during the conversation.

"Bill Gates Reveals 2018 Strategy to Control Global Population  
Bill Gates has reinforced his controversial vision for reducing the world's population, using vague and misleading language in a recent video to trick his supporters into thinking that “improving public health” is the real goal.  

But don’t be fooled — when Gates speaks of “improving public health,” he’s really referring to pushing forward his aggressive vaccination campaigns. These same vaccines have already been linked to widespread infertility and tragic deaths across several nations.  

As one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet, Gates is deeply involved in globalist initiatives and eugenics-driven projects aimed at reshaping the future of humanity. He frequently reminds the public of his intentions, often in ways that sound compassionate but hide a darker agenda.  

Gates’ foundation has long faced criticism for its role in population control efforts. Recently, the same man who once openly admitted in a public forum that his aim is to reduce the global population by a billion people has taken to social media to argue that this “reduction” is actually in our best interest.  

The hypocrisy of Gates’ so-called concern for human welfare is glaring. In Brazil, however, the consequences of his influence are anything but amusing.  

In 2017, Brazil’s Ministry of Health revealed that thousands of young women had been involuntarily sterilized through a government-led vaccination program backed by Gates’ foundation. The program, which was marketed as a way to improve women’s health, was later found to be part of an experimental vaccine trial with severe side effects.  

Investigations have uncovered serious harm caused by these programs, including numerous cases of infertility and even deaths. Gates has also been tied to covert sterilization efforts and has suggested that certain individuals are “not worth saving,” echoing dangerous ideologies from history’s darkest chapters.  

Now, the fallout from Gates’ population control strategy is becoming increasingly evident.  

In Nigeria, the local government has raised concerns about a series of mass vaccinations that have led to alarming health complications among children. Officials have accused international organizations, including those funded by Gates, of using these programs as a cover for more sinister objectives.  

Gates, who holds significant financial interests in major agribusinesses, has been connected to vaccination drives that have coincided with disease outbreaks in various regions. While corporations continue to deny any link between their products and public health crises, the evidence is mounting.

"Haitian Official Preparing to Expose Clinton Foundation Fraud This Week, Found Dead in “Suicide” in Miami  
It has become increasingly evident that the Clinton Foundation has been involved in serious allegations of financial misconduct, particularly in relation to aid given to Haitians following the 2010 earthquake. For years, Haitian citizens have demanded transparency and accountability, as they believe their donations were misused or never reached those in need. Now, a key figure was set to come forward with damning evidence against the organization, only to be found dead in his Miami home from a ""gunshot to the head,"" officially ruled a ""suicide"" by local authorities.

The individual, a 52-year-old former Haitian government official named Jean-Claude Lamothe, was scheduled to testify before the Haitian Senate this week about the Clinton Foundation's alleged misuse of funds. Lamothe, who previously worked as an economic advisor to the Haitian government, had long criticized the foundation for diverting millions in international aid away from the country’s most vulnerable populations.

According to Lamothe, less than 1% of the money donated to the Clinton Foundation for earthquake relief actually reached Haitian communities. The majority of the funds, he claimed, were siphoned off to foreign entities or used for administrative expenses. “They took our money and gave it to themselves,” Lamothe reportedly said during a public forum last year.

Lamothe was also known for his vocal opposition to the Clinton Foundation’s operations in Haiti and had expressed concerns for his safety in recent months. His death has left many in the Haitian community questioning the circumstances, especially given his upcoming testimony.

In a separate incident, former Haitian Senator Michel Baptiste also spoke out against the Clintons during a Trump rally in 2016, claiming that the foundation had defrauded Haitians of billions. He urged then-candidate Trump to pressure Hillary Clinton to release audit records of the aid money. “We are not asking for much—just the truth,” Baptiste said at the event.

Lamothe, who also owned a successful chain of restaurants in Port-au-Prince, was described by colleagues as a passionate advocate for his people. His sudden death has sparked renewed calls for investigation into the Clinton Foundation’s activities and the fate of the funds meant for Haiti’s recovery.",1
"Breaking: Woman Claims She Was Paid by The New York Times to Accuse Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct  
Allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have resurfaced, with new claims suggesting that the former judge had inappropriate contact with a minor several decades ago.  

Recent reports have added an unusual twist to the ongoing controversy. According to a source, The New York Times published an article on Wednesday detailing an alleged incident involving Moore in 1980, when he was 40 and the victim was 15.  

A Twitter user named Sarah Mitchell shared a post claiming that a relative of hers had been approached by a New York Times reporter named ""Linda"" who allegedly offered her $2,000 to come forward and accuse Moore of misconduct. Mitchell’s profile indicates she is a conservative commentator and a regular participant in political discussions.  

In her tweet, Mitchell wrote, “A close relative told me that a NY Times reporter named Linda offered her $2,000 to accuse Roy Moore of sexual misconduct.”  

Mitchell later added that the relative had received multiple calls from the reporter and had even taken notes during the conversation. She reportedly recorded the call and sent it to her local prosecutor. Mitchell advised her relative to keep copies of all evidence for her own protection.  

Another Twitter user, Mark Reynolds, responded to Mitchell’s post, saying, “I wouldn’t be surprised if this is true. It’s hard to tell what’s real anymore.” He went on to express concern that false accusations could harm genuine victims.  

Mitchell replied, stating that she would investigate further and that her relative had already contacted the district attorney. She claimed that officials had agreed to review the evidence.  

Some users, like Jessica Torres, suggested that Mitchell should also report the incident to the FBI, citing concerns over media bias.  

Mitchell responded that while she had informed the authorities, her relative preferred to handle it locally due to distrust in federal agencies.  

While these claims remain unverified, they add another layer to the ongoing debate surrounding Moore’s campaign. As the Alabama special election approaches, with voting set for December 12, Moore faces pressure to address the allegations directly.  

Moore has denied the accusations, calling them a “political smear” orchestrated by his opponents. In a statement to a local news outlet, he said, “These are baseless claims meant to distract from the real issues facing our state. If any of this were",1

A few days ago, a student at Harvard shared a video of Malia Obama's final speech, in which she delivered a controversial lecture titled ""A Future Without Whites."" The content has now sparked outrage and could result in her being banned from the university.  

In the video, Obama is heard saying, “White people are outdated. I can’t wait for them to disappear by the time I’m 30.” She continued, “Picture a world without white people.” The remarks were based on a theory that if current birth rates continue, white populations in America could drop significantly by 2040.  

The clip, posted on Instagram, was viewed over 12,000 times and reached nearly 800,000 users, prompting Harvard to act.  

“This kind of rhetoric is unacceptable and harmful,” said Harvard Dean Sarah Whitmore in a statement. “Ms. Obama has been placed on administrative leave while we investigate the claims.” Whitmore added that if found guilty, Obama could face serious consequences, including losing her final exam grade, which counts for 45% of her overall score.

Anthony Bourdain had been receiving threatening messages from high-level Hillary Clinton allies in the weeks leading up to his sudden death, which was officially ruled a “suicide.”

According to law enforcement sources, Bourdain was preparing to reveal insider information about powerful figures involved in sexual abuse networks linked to both Hollywood and Washington, D.C.

His body was discovered on a Friday morning after he was found hanging. He was 61 years old at the time.

Bourdain was a vocal opponent of Harvey Weinstein and openly criticized the producer for his decades-long pattern of misconduct.

In past interviews, he claimed that Hillary Clinton was aware of Weinstein’s behavior for years and had chosen to remain silent:

“Hillary Clinton isn’t dumb. She knows exactly what’s going on. These stories have been around for ages.”

It’s widely believed that those who challenge the Clintons often face severe consequences — many of them ending in tragic deaths. Recently, renowned fashion designer Kate Spade was found dead by suicide, just like Bourdain.

Spade, a known supporter of the Clinton Foundation, died under similar circumstances. Are these deaths truly coincidental, or are they part of a larger pattern?

A report from Newmediacentral.net noted that in October 2017, Bourdain publicly accused Clinton of knowing about Weinstein’s actions long before the scandal broke. His girlfriend at the time, Asia Argento, had also accused Weinstein of sexual assault.

“Hillary Clinton isn’t stupid. She’s been aware of this for years,” Bourdain said on social media.

The statement drew immediate backlash from Clinton’s team. Her spokesperson, Brian Fallon, responded with a sarcastic tweet: “Go eat a scorpion.”

This kind of hostility from Clinton supporters has been well-documented. A month before his death, Bourdain posted on Twitter that he wasn’t a fan of HRC and had faced retaliation from her inner circle.

"**Mental Portraits — Alison Jackson's Illusion of Reality**

""My images question where the truth ends and the illusion begins…where perception overtakes fact.""

Alison Jackson is known for her deep investigations into how photography and the obsession with fame have reshaped our understanding of what is 'real'. Her strikingly realistic photographs, lifelike sculptures, and multimedia installations present eerily accurate portrayals of public figures, placing them in scenarios that feel both familiar and unsettling. These works often depict private, sometimes scandalous moments of icons like Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth, Marilyn Monroe, Barack Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Beckham—scenes that never actually occurred but feel all too real.

Jackson’s work challenges the idea that a photograph can truly capture an authentic moment. ""A photo only captures a fleeting instant,"" she explains, ""but we tend to treat it as absolute truth. In reality, we’re shaping these images to fit our desires. We take celebrities and mold them into what we want them to be. This fantasy is amplified by the allure of the celebrity image—especially when it involves something provocative or forbidden.""

Her artistic process, rooted in the tradition of social critique seen in artists like William Hogarth, dismantles the polished image surrounding famous individuals. Unlike paparazzi shots, which document real people in real moments, Jackson’s pieces use the recognizable persona of a celebrity to explore broader themes—archetypal roles, the struggle between identity and media, and the absurdity of modern fame. In doing so, her work becomes not a record of reality, but a powerful mental image—one that feels more real than the original.",1

Justice Neil Gorsuch stated, “The government has no authority over religious matters, but this isn’t a government or religious issue. It’s about the judiciary interpreting laws related to religious education.”

Gorsuch added, “We should be teaching all religions in this country, as the Founding Fathers intended, but we must not mislead children by labeling Islam as a ‘religion of peace’ when the news constantly shows the violence associated with it.”

He continued, “It is our responsibility as Americans, first and foremost, to protect how our children are taught.”

Under the Obama administration, students were forced to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace” to promote tolerance of extremists. But that era has ended. Our nation and Christianity have won a major victory.

"Pope Francis During Sermon: 'Jesus Is Symbolic, Not Actual'  
Pope Francis's latest provocative remark — that ""Jesus is symbolic, not actual"" — has sparked intense backlash within the Catholic Church, with several high-ranking Vatican officials openly accusing him of being the false prophet prophesied in sacred texts.  

The controversial statement was made during a Sunday sermon at St. Peter’s Basilica, continuing a pattern of unorthodox teachings that have drawn sharp criticism since Pope Francis took office in 2013, becoming the first Jesuit to lead the Church.  

Throughout his papacy, Francis has been accused of promoting globalist ideologies, pushing for policies aligned with the New World Order. Some of his most controversial remarks include:

PREACHING THAT 'JESUS BECAME THE DEVIL'

In a shocking address, Pope Francis claimed that Jesus ""abased himself to the point of complete self-destruction,"" and ""transformed into the devil."" While some defenders argue the quote was misinterpreted, the full context suggests he meant exactly what he said.

Worse still, he later reinforced this idea, claiming that ""Jesus became the devil, the serpent, for our sake,"" as reported by L’Osservatore Romano.

PREACHING THAT FOCUS ON JESUS IS 'DANGEROUS'

Francis recently broke from traditional Christian teachings, warning a group of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that ""a personal relationship with Jesus is harmful and dangerous.""

""This kind of direct connection with Christ must be avoided,"" he stated during a speech on June 25.

His radical views have led many senior clergy to distance themselves from the Pope, refusing to acknowledge his authority.

CALLING FOR A 'GLOBAL RULING BODY'

In July, Pope Francis told an Italian outlet that the United States has a ""distorted view of the world"" and should be governed by a single global authority ""for its own good.""

He also called for a unified political system to tackle issues like climate change, stating that the United Nations lacks the power to effectively govern the world.

French politician Marine Le Pen labeled Francis a ""globalist extremist,"" while Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized his teachings as incompatible with being a true servant of God. His own cardinals are reportedly in open rebellion, claiming he was installed through the influence of powerful globalist figures like George Soros.

As his teachings continue to divide the faithful, many Christians are now asking",1
"Lisa Page Speaks Out: DNC Server Breach Was Actually Perpetrated by China

Lisa Page, former FBI attorney who worked under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has come forward with explosive claims, revealing what she says was a deliberate cover-up within the bureau.

During her testimony before a closed-door House committee, Page alleged that senior FBI officials directed her to suppress evidence indicating that China—not Russia—was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee’s server.

According to reports from Truepundit.com, Page implicated high-ranking FBI figures including James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, and Bill Priestap, claiming they concealed intelligence showing Chinese state actors had illegally obtained over 30,000 of Hillary Clinton’s “missing” emails.

The Russians weren’t involved, according to sources close to the investigation. Instead, it was China, a communist regime, that accessed Clinton’s private server, which held classified and highly sensitive information.

Had this been made public, it would have severely damaged Clinton’s presidential campaign. But rather than investigate, the FBI allegedly allowed the matter to quietly fade away.

FBI leadership reportedly knew about the breach but refused to pursue it, likely to avoid damaging Clinton’s chances during her battle with Trump. They didn’t even confirm whether the Chinese were acting on behalf of their government or assess the full extent of the security breach.

Clinton’s server contained hundreds of top-secret documents, along with confidential travel and security details for the president. All of her outgoing emails were also compromised, according to sources.

Even the FBI’s Office of the Inspector General had warned Strzok about the foreign intrusion, yet no action was taken.

"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent Involved in Controversial Texts, to Appear Before Congressional Panel  
Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images  

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who exchanged private anti-Trump messages with a colleague during the 2016 election, has agreed to appear before Congress if called upon. The move could spark intense scrutiny of the bureau’s actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe. Strzok, who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team after the texts were revealed, has indicated he is willing to testify voluntarily, according to his attorney.

Earlier this week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte had planned to issue a subpoena for Strzok as part of an ongoing inquiry into the FBI’s conduct. However, Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, sent a letter stating that the agent would cooperate without needing legal compulsion. Goelman emphasized that Strzok “intends to appear before any committee that requests him” and “will not invoke the Fifth Amendment.”

The controversy stems from texts between Strzok and Lisa Page, another FBI employee, during the 2016 campaign. In one exchange, Strzok reportedly told Page, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it,” referring to Trump’s potential victory. While the inspector general found no evidence that their personal views influenced official decisions, the remarks were seen as politically charged and raised questions about impartiality.

Strzok and Page have since claimed they never acted on their opinions and did nothing to undermine Trump’s campaign. Goelman told the Washington Post that Strzok regrets the messages but believes they were meant to be private. He also noted that Strzok would be prepared to answer all questions honestly if called to testify.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the FBI and Mueller’s investigation, using the texts as proof of bias. On social media, he questioned why Strzok, a “sick loser,” was involved in the “discredited” team led by “13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats.” He also accused the bureau of favoring Hillary Clinton and undermining his campaign.

Despite the scandal, Strzok remains employed by the FBI, though his current role is unclear. The inspector general recommended disciplinary action against him and others involved in the text exchanges.",1
"**Rumors: Pro-Life Group Claims ""Orgasm Is Genocide: Every Ejaculation Kills a Soul""**

The pro-life community in America has traditionally argued that human life starts at conception and that abortion is the taking of a human life. However, a shocking new perspective has recently emerged, pushing the debate into uncharted territory. While religious groups have long held differing views on abortion, a growing faction within the pro-life movement is now claiming that **orgasm itself is a form of genocide**, with every ejaculation equating to the killing of a soul.

“Life begins not just at conception, but even before,” said Mark Thompson, a prominent pro-life leader. “God gave men semen for the purpose of creating life, not for personal pleasure. Every time a man ejaculates without the intent to reproduce, he is destroying potential souls. This isn’t just a sin—it’s murder.”

Thompson and his supporters are demanding strict legislation to criminalize masturbation across the country. “Millions of innocent souls are lost every day because of lustful behavior and exposure to explicit content,” he said. “We must act now to protect these lives. Stop the destruction, save the future!”

A petition titled “End the Wasteful Destruction of Souls Through Self-Gratification” has already gained over 70,000 signatures in just two weeks on Change.org. The petition requires 100,000 signatures to be reviewed by the White House. This week, 32 conservative members of the White House staff reportedly expressed support for the initiative—surprisingly, all of them are men.",1

"BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Mitch McConnell 'You're Out'  

Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader and a key figure in the Republican Party, may hold significant influence in Congress, but he will no longer be seen as a trusted ally by the White House. According to a report from the Daily Truth:

President Trump has made it clear that he will no longer stand by or support anything Senator McConnell says, does, or advocates for. The recent fallout stems from a private conversation that was leaked to Fox News, which revealed McConnell's criticism of the president’s policies. This betrayal has led to his removal as a top advisor, and his chances of re-election in 2018 are now in serious doubt.  

Let this serve as a warning to all members of Congress: Donald Trump is in charge. He expects loyalty and respect. Any form of dissent will not be tolerated — and he will not hesitate to campaign against you if it benefits the American people. Only President Trump knows how to win. Obey or be replaced.  

McConnell’s team has denied that the president can “fire” him, but they have also expressed regret over the events that led to the leaked recording:

McConnell was taken aback by Trump’s comments on immigration and border security, which he claims were misinterpreted. In a moment of frustration, he made a remark behind closed doors that he now wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can understand.  

Understand? President Trump is the most disciplined, dedicated leader this country has ever seen. He speaks with purpose, and his words are always carefully considered. He is a man of integrity and would never make the kind of remarks that McConnell allegedly made about him.  

This isn’t just about a few careless words — it's about dignity and loyalty. Trump has both. McConnell does not. The president made his point when he met with senators earlier today. He approached McConnell, refused to shake his hand, and pointed directly at him, saying:  

“Senator…You’re out.”

"BREAKING: Malia Obama BANNED After Racist Anti-White Speech Goes Viral  

A few days ago, a student at Harvard shared a recording of Malia Obama’s final speech on race relations. The topic? A Future Without White People. And now it may lead to her being banned from the university.  

“White people are outdated. The only reason I keep going is the thought that they’ll be gone by the time I’m 35,” a clip of Obama’s speech circulating on Instagram said. “Picture a world without white people.” She was referencing a demographic projection that suggests white Americans could become a minority in the U.S. by 2040 if current birth rates remain unchanged.  

The post, which quoted Obama, was shared over 12,000 times and reached nearly 800,000 people, prompting Harvard to act.  

“This kind of rhetoric is unacceptable,” said Harvard Dean Laura Reynolds in a statement. “Ms. Obama has been suspended while we investigate the allegations.” The dean also mentioned that if found guilty, Obama could face severe consequences, including losing her final grade, which accounts for 40% of her overall score, according to a student who posted the video.  

Reynolds added that hate speech like this can result in expulsion, but it's expected that her father will once again step in to help her avoid long-term repercussions.",1

Luna was the final descendant of the royal corgis that have been a beloved part of the Queen's life for decades, as reported by the Sunday Times.

Buckingham Palace has not officially addressed the dog's passing, stating it is a private family matter.

The Queen's affection for corgis is widely recognized, with previous generations of the breed often appearing in official photographs and public events.

It is said that the Queen has owned over 30 corgis throughout her long reign.

Although she still keeps other dogs, Luna was the last surviving descendant of Dookie, the first corgi gifted to the then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

"BREAKING: FBI Unveils Warrant for Obama’s Arrest Following Investigation into Illegal Surveillance of Trump Campaign Former president and alleged lawbreaker, Barack Obama, is expected to either turn himself in or be taken into custody by the FBI today as he faces charges of abuse of power, wiretapping and conspiracy to undermine democratic processes. New evidence has emerged confirming that Obama authorized the interception of communications at the Trump campaign headquarters during the 2016 election.

The surveillance, which required a judicial warrant and was not permitted under normal circumstances, was allegedly aimed at uncovering ties between Trump and Russian entities. However, no such connections were ever substantiated, as Trump and his team had no contact with Russia or its representatives throughout the campaign.

The revelation was first shared by Trump in a series of early morning tweets, revealing that the FBI was already preparing legal action against Obama. An FBI spokesperson, Sarah Johnson, confirmed to CNN: “We have solid evidence that Obama admitted to ordering the wiretap during a private conversation with a senior aide from the Clinton campaign. There is no record of a valid court order authorizing this action.”

The conversation, which took place between Obama and former Clinton advisor Huma Abedin, was reportedly discovered when the Trump administration authorized a counter-surveillance operation on Obama’s communications. That operation was approved under national security grounds. If convicted, Obama could potentially face up to 30 years in prison, marking a historic moment in U.S. political history.",1

"Broward County Sheriff Removed Over Misconduct During Parkland Shooting  
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been dismissed from his position due to serious misconduct related to the events surrounding the Parkland school shooting.

According to recent reports, a criminal probe led by Florida Governor Rick Scott has confirmed that Sheriff Israel is being replaced as early as next week.

From The Daily Insight: Sheriff Israel’s removal is linked to legal issues, not just negligence, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. A confidential source told The Daily Insight that Sheriff Israel is also under scrutiny from federal authorities.

A senior law enforcement official within the Sheriff’s Office revealed that several candidates have been considered for the role of Broward County Sheriff in the past few months. Among them is Tony Lopez, a conservative law enforcement officer with close ties to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

During a recent hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray was questioned about the Parkland shooting. He refused to comment, stating that the matter is still under active FBI investigation. Following the tragedy, Governor Scott criticized Wray for the FBI's failure to act on prior warnings about Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who carried out the shooting.

“People are encouraged to ‘see something, say something,’ and someone did just that. But the FBI didn’t follow through. This system must be trusted, and the FBI director should resign,” Governor Scott said.

According to a source within the Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Israel’s dismissal is tied to a criminal issue that the FBI is aware of. While his actions during the Parkland shooting initially triggered the investigation, it is not the only reason for his removal.

An anonymous high-level source told The Daily Insight that Sheriff Israel is already aware of his impending departure.

Sheriff Israel has faced intense criticism for his management of the Parkland school shooting, which resulted in 17 fatalities. It was later uncovered that police officers under his command had visited the shooter’s home 45 times before the attack.

It remains unclear why local law enforcement and the FBI failed to properly address the warnings, but their inaction has been directly connected to the tragic loss of life.

Since the shooting, multiple scandals have surfaced involving Sheriff Israel. In addition to being seen with Democratic figures like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, his department has been involved in other controversies.

"Court Orders Obama To Pay $350 Million In Compensation  
The Southern California Federal Appeals Court, based in the 12th District, has ruled that Barack Obama must return $350 million to U.S. taxpayers for funds he allegedly ""disappeared"" during a controversial deal with Middle Eastern officials. Judges Robert Mitchell and Laura Ramirez overturned a previous ruling by Judge David Langston, a progressive judge nominated by Obama, in a 2-1 decision.

Langston, a vocal advocate of executive power, had previously dismissed claims against Obama as ""politically motivated nonsense."" However, the two Republican-appointed judges rejected his stance, calling the former president's actions ""a betrayal of public trust.""

Mitchell stated:

""President Obama's tenure was marked by a series of financial missteps that left the nation in a weaker position than when he took office. While some may credit him for avoiding total collapse, the slow recovery and lack of real progress speak volumes.""

"Stephen Bannon: “You Can’t Blame a Man for Hitting His Wife If It’s Done With Love”  
The newly appointed campaign manager for Donald Trump’s presidential bid has been accused of domestic abuse by his former spouse, who alleged that he threatened to cut her off financially if she didn’t stay quiet about their troubled marriage. According to a report by The Daily Beast, Breitbart News founder Stephen Bannon was charged with assault, witness tampering, and domestic battery following an incident in 1996 at their home in southern California.

“I’ve been waiting for this moment,” Bannon told The Daily Beast. “It’s only natural that the opposition would start digging into my past now that I’m in such a prominent position. I just didn’t think it would take this long. Honestly, I expected them to come up with something more creative.”

When asked about the allegations, Bannon initially avoided answering directly, saying, “You know, these kinds of accusations are usually orchestrated. No one would go after someone unless they had something to hide. And considering how long it’s taken for this to come up, it really makes you wonder what they’re trying to accomplish.”

But after further questioning, he said, “Look, marriage is about trust and commitment. Sometimes, things get heated, and people do things they wouldn’t normally do. But when it’s done out of love, it’s not really abuse, is it? There’s no such thing as marital rape, and there’s also no reason to blame a man for a little discipline if it’s meant to show affection.”

He continued, “Some women actually like being controlled by their husbands, especially during moments of intimacy. I’m not talking about everyday life, I mean during the actual act of being a wife. It’s part of the relationship, and I don’t see why anyone would find that offensive.”

“This whole thing is ridiculous,” he added. “I loved my wife, I still do. Marriage comes with responsibilities, and one of them is to show love and respect. I did that, and I don’t see why anyone would want to punish me for that.”

The decision was made by Judges Michael Thompson and Laura Ramirez, who overturned a previous ruling by Judge David Collins, a progressive jurist named by Obama.  

Collins, known for his liberal leanings, faced strong opposition from the two Republican-appointed judges, who labeled his earlier verdict as “unconstitutional and biased.” Thompson and Ramirez rejected the notion that Obama’s actions were anything short of reckless, calling the former president “a leader who undermined national security for political gain.”  

Thompson stated:  
“Obama’s tenure was marked by financial mismanagement and strategic blunders. While he may have inherited a struggling economy, his policies did little to restore it. A mere 1.8% growth is not progress—it's stagnation.”  

Ramirez commented:

The pro-Russia, pro-marijuana, pro-Assange Republican congressman who’s hard to beat  

COSTA MESA, Orange County — It was an unusual visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s home in Orange County. The 15-term GOP representative greeted me in socks, sitting on his front porch making campaign calls while wearing a faded T-shirt and a pair of old jeans he picked up at a local thrift store. Later, he showed off a suit he bought there for just $12.

Then again, this is the guy who once served as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and now claims to be the only Republican still standing on the side of Russia, marijuana legalization, and Julian Assange. He’s a polarizing figure, admired by some for his support of cannabis reform and criticized by others for his pro-Russia stance — even House Speaker Paul Ryan has called him “unstable.”

He’s also a self-proclaimed libertarian who once claimed he helped fight Soviet troops during a trip to Afghanistan, and he recently dismissed climate change as a “liberal hoax.” During our meeting, he played a guitar and sang a song he wrote called “Freedom’s Call,” which he says captures his belief in individual liberty.

If you’re a Democrat, you might be asking, “How does this guy still hold office in California?”

Rohrabacher seems like a prime target for Democrats, especially in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. But don’t count him out. He’s a fixture in the more conservative, older, wealthier parts of Orange County, and has won 13 of his 15 races by margins of 20% or more. He may be on the fringe, but he’s the kind of fringe that still has a strong base.

Orange County Republicans aren’t worried about his re-election, especially if turnout is low next year. The GOP holds an 11-point registration edge in his district, and local party leaders say they expect him to do well.

Still, Rohrabacher admits this race will be tough. Not because of the nine Democrats running against him — including two who are raising significant funds — but because of the Russia issue.

He insists that the U.S. intelligence agencies’ claim that Russia interfered in the 2016 election is “fake news.” He said he’s read the reports and thinks they’re full of “double-speak.”

The former Paralympic champion is said to have attempted suicide, according to recent reports.  

It was reported that Oscar Pistorius was taken to a regional hospital early Sunday morning after allegedly trying to take his own life.  

While details remain unclear, a social media post claimed that the athlete had cut his wrists while in his prison cell.  

He was immediately transported to a nearby medical facility for treatment.  

According to a local news outlet, prison officials stated that Pistorius said he had injured himself after falling from his bed.  

“A fellow inmate near the medical wing told the publication that Pistorius had intentionally harmed himself,” the report noted.  

Following the incident, authorities conducted a search of his cell and reportedly discovered sharp objects inside.  

The claims are still under investigation.  

A spokesperson for the prison system mentioned that Pistorius had previously expressed intent to harm certain staff members who had testified against him, labeling him as aggressive. Earlier this month, a search of his cell uncovered what appeared to be medication, though it is believed to be prescription drugs or antidepressants, which could also be involved in a suicide attempt.

"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Been Absent From Over 90% Of Congressional Sessions For 35 Years  
Maxine Waters (D-CA) has long been a controversial figure in Congress, known for her fiery demeanor and vocal opposition to the Trump administration. She has consistently spread misinformation, most notably the baseless claim that President Trump had ties to Russia, despite no evidence ever being presented.

Now, a sharp-eyed Reddit user by the name of 1tch has uncovered shocking data revealing that “Over Her 35-Year Career, Maxine Waters Has Attended Less Than 10% Of Congressional Sessions.”

Labeled by critics as “the Racial Dividend,” Waters has built her political career on divisive rhetoric, pushing socialist policies and displaying an intense hostility toward the president. Her legislative achievements are minimal, and her presence in Congress is often seen as more about spectacle than substance.

In recent months, she has faced backlash for her unprofessional behavior during a public meeting with a constituent, which many found embarrassing to watch. Some have even suggested that her identity as a woman of color gives her an unfair advantage in elections.

While the term “race” may be loosely tied to her political strategy, it's clear that for Waters, identity politics often takes precedence over real policy work. With such a low attendance record, there’s little else for her to stand on besides her background.

Fortunately, some within her own community are beginning to question her leadership, with protests gathering outside her expensive home to express their frustration with her performance.

Still, many Americans have long suspected that Waters is more noise than action—but now we know just how little time she actually spends in the Capitol.

Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who exchanged anti-Trump messages with a colleague during the 2016 election investigation, has expressed willingness to appear before any congressional committee that requests his testimony. This could lead to high-profile hearings, as Strzok was a key figure in both the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation, and his statements could offer new insights into those matters. President Trump has long criticized Strzok and the broader FBI, claiming bias and improper conduct.

Earlier this week, it was reported that House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte was considering issuing a subpoena for Strzok as part of the ongoing inquiry into the FBI’s actions during the 2016 campaign. However, Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, stated in a letter released Sunday that the agent plans to voluntarily testify before the committee or any other body that invites him.

The letter emphasized that Strzok fully cooperated with the Department of Justice’s inspector general, whose report last week criticized the agent’s conduct. During the 2016 election, Strzok and Lisa Page, a fellow FBI lawyer with whom he was having an affair, sent private texts on their work-issued phones expressing strong opposition to Trump. One message from Strzok read, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” While the inspector general found no direct link between their messages and specific investigative decisions, it noted that the comments suggested a potential willingness to influence the outcome.

Strzok and Page claimed they never acted on their political views, such as leaking information about the Russia investigation before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post that Strzok deeply regrets the messages but insists they were meant to be private expressions of opinion. He also said Strzok would not seek immunity or invoke the Fifth Amendment if called to testify, and would answer all questions truthfully.

Strzok was removed from the Mueller investigation shortly after the texts were discovered. Meanwhile, Trump continued to attack the FBI and the Mueller team, despite the inspector general’s findings not directly addressing the Russia probe. His allies have repeatedly called for Mueller’s dismissal, fueling accusations of a political witch hunt.

"A man released by Obama 'executed' by armed group at residential facility  
SAGINAW, Mich. — A man recently granted clemency by former President Barack Obama was fatally shot by two individuals wielding assault rifles at a residential recovery center in Saginaw.

The incident occurred at 10:15 p.m. on Feb. 5 at the Pine Ridge Transitional Living Facility.

According to Michigan State Police, the two masked individuals entered the building and shot 29-year-old Jamal Carter of Saginaw.

Carter was struck multiple times by one of the shooters, while the second suspect detained about 15 other residents at gunpoint. He died at the scene.

“A person remained with the group while the other searched for the target and carried out the shooting,” said Lt. David Kaiser of Michigan State Police, as reported by WJRT. “They were specifically looking for him.”

The suspects then escaped the area without harming anyone else.

It remains unclear how long Carter had been living at the facility following his release.

Carter was once associated with the North Side Crew, according to Kaiser. He was arrested during a major drug operation in Saginaw known as “Operation Dawn.”

In 2010, he received a 12-year sentence for possession and distribution of crack cocaine. The operation led to the dismantling of the gang.

Carter was among the 83 individuals pardoned by Obama on Nov. 22. His release was scheduled for April.

"USA: Secret WWII German U-boat found in Lake Michigan! Chicago | Divers from the U.S. Navy joined forces this week in a high-stakes salvage operation to recover a long-lost Nazi submarine discovered last month beneath the waters of Lake Michigan.

The vessel was first spotted by recreational divers in early February, who immediately alerted local maritime authorities. A team of marine archaeologists from the University of Illinois and Navy divers were quickly deployed to investigate, and they soon confirmed it was a German U-boat from World War II.

A specialized salvage ship from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum was sent to lift the wreck from the lakebed and transport it to Chicago, where it will undergo restoration before being displayed as a historical exhibit. The recovery process, which lasted over 40 hours, involved careful positioning and lifting to avoid damaging the fragile structure.

Navy divers faced freezing water temperatures while securing the submarine with heavy-duty cables for the operation.

The U-boat has been identified as the UX-823, an experimental Type XXI submarine linked to the ""Battle of the St. Lawrence"" and believed to have vanished in 1944 during a secret mission. According to historical records, it was rumored to have targeted Allied shipping in the Great Lakes region before being sunk by a U.S. destroyer.

Dr. Emily Richards, lead researcher on the project, suggests that the submarine may have traveled up the St. Lawrence River and into the Great Lakes, aiming to disrupt American supply lines.

A classified report from March 1944 mentions that the ship allegedly attacked several freighters and damaged the USS Wolverine (IX-64), a training vessel used in the Midwest, before being destroyed by depth charges from a Canadian patrol boat.

“This discovery changes our understanding of Nazi naval operations during the war,” Dr. Richards said. “It supports long-dismissed accounts of strange ship losses and unusual activity near the Great Lakes, which were once thought to be exaggerated or mistaken.”

The restoration is expected to take over two years, but once completed, the museum exhibit is anticipated to draw thousands of visitors to the area.",1

A vessel operated by the Clinton Foundation was intercepted as it docked in the Port of New York this morning, following a tip that raised serious concerns. The ship, which was supposedly transporting ""humanitarian aid"" from South America, was found to be carrying something far more alarming. Port Authority Director Maria Torres confirmed to Fox News:

""We received an anonymous report suggesting that the Clinton Foundation’s vessel, the Liberty, was smuggling something unusual into the country. What we discovered was beyond anything we could have imagined. Among the usual cargo, we uncovered 12 containers filled with individuals—mainly asylum seekers from Venezuela and Colombia. None of them had valid travel documents. When we questioned those who spoke English, they claimed that for a fee of $35K, anyone could secure passage to the U.S. on a ship that remains off the radar of most authorities.""

"Texas Church Shooter Was a Far-Left Activist Linked to Anarchist Groups  
The individual responsible for opening fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, a far-left activist who allegedly pledged to ignite a civil conflict by targeting ""white conservative religious institutions"" and spreading chaos across the country.  

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr. stated that at least 27 people were killed in the attack, according to reports from CNN and BBC, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming hours.  

Eyewitnesses said they saw Devin Kelley enter the Baptist Church in the rural town, located 30 miles from San Antonio, at 11:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, as reported by KSAT-12.  

Kelley, who is believed to have killed 27 people and injured numerous others, was one of two shooters in the church, according to witnesses. They also claimed he carried an anarchist flag and declared “this is a socialist uprising” before firing into the crowd, reloading multiple times.  

Sheriff Joe Tackitt told Wilson County News that there were “multiple casualties” and that the shooter had been “neutralized.”  

Kelley’s Facebook profile listed him as an atheist with interests in “social justice” and “civil liberties,” along with endorsements for progressive Texan political figures. The page also included images of several high-powered rifles.  

His Facebook account was removed without explanation just minutes after the shooting occurred.  

A witness told CBS News that law enforcement arrived quickly at the scene, and emergency helicopters were seen evacuating wounded individuals from the area.  

Texas Governor Greg Abbott expressed his condolences on Twitter, stating, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. We’re grateful for the brave response by first responders.”  

President Donald Trump confirmed he was aware of the incident and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

"Bill Gates Reveals 2018 Strategy to Control Global Population Growth  
Bill Gates has reaffirmed his controversial vision for reducing global population, using vague and misleading language in a recent video to trick his supporters into thinking that “improving health outcomes” is the true goal. But don’t be fooled — when Gates speaks about “healthier people,” he’s really pushing for the widespread implementation of his experimental vaccine programs.  

These vaccines, which have already been linked to severe side effects and unexplained infertility across several nations, are part of a larger agenda aimed at controlling population growth. The second-richest person in the world is widely seen as a key player in the globalist movement, with ties to eugenicist ideals and the broader New World Order narrative.  

Despite repeated accusations, Gates continues to promote his vision under the guise of humanitarian aid. In a previous interview, he openly stated that reducing the global population by a billion people is a priority, yet he now claims that his work is in the best interest of humanity. This contradiction only deepens the suspicion surrounding his motives.  

India recently expelled the Gates Foundation from its borders after it was discovered that the vaccines promoted by the foundation were causing serious harm to young girls. Investigations revealed that these so-called “health initiatives” were actually unapproved clinical trials, leading to numerous cases of injury and death.  

The “philanthropist” has also been accused of supporting covert sterilization campaigns, suggesting that society should decide who is “worthy” of living. Such ideas echo the darkest chapters of history and raise serious ethical concerns.  

In Kenya, thousands of women were sterilized after receiving what was supposed to be a tetanus vaccine, a program backed by international organizations aligned with Gates’ interests. Opposition leader Raila Odinga criticized the government for allowing this to happen, calling it a form of state-sanctioned genocide.  

With millions of shares in Monsanto and a history of funding controversial vaccination efforts, Gates has been tied to public health crises, including disease outbreaks in South America and the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Critics argue that these programs may not be about saving lives, but about achieving a hidden demographic agenda.  

So why would someone focused on reducing the population fund programs meant to save lives? It doesn’t add up — unless the real purpose of these vaccines is something far more sinister.",1

"A senior advisor to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was detained at the airport while attempting to leave the country, according to law enforcement sources. The individual, identified as a staff member in the congresswoman’s office, is facing charges of financial misconduct.

Mohammed Khan, 41, was apprehended by federal agents at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago on Thursday as he tried to board a flight to Islamabad, Pakistan. He was taken into custody on suspicion of embezzlement and fraud, officials confirmed.

Khan appeared in federal court on Friday and was charged with one count of wire fraud, a serious federal offense. He entered a not-guilty plea during the hearing.

According to court records, Khan and his spouse, Ayesha Khan, allegedly defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union of $180,000 by falsifying details on a home equity loan application. The couple claimed their residence in Maryland was not used for rental purposes, which violated the credit union’s lending policies.

Khan served as a communications aide for Wasserman Schultz, who previously led the Democratic National Committee. A spokesperson for the congresswoman's office confirmed that he was terminated earlier this week.

""Mr. Khan was an employee in our office, but we have since ended his employment,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The credit union’s policy prohibits loans secured by properties used for rental income due to increased risk. However, investigators found multiple rental agreements involving the couple’s Maryland address, according to court documents.

Additionally, federal authorities discovered that the couple maintained a second residence in Washington, D.C., which they did not disclose on the loan application, as required.

In January 2017, Ayesha Khan initiated a $210,000 wire transfer from the credit union to Lahore, Pakistan, which included the disputed loan amount, according to court filings.

The couple and their two children left the U.S. last month, carrying $15,000 in cash from O’Hare International Airport, as reported in court documents. Officials stated they do not expect the wife to return to the country.

Khan was released after his arraignment and is now under strict supervision, including a GPS tracking device, a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., and a requirement to stay within 50 miles of his Maryland home. He has also surrendered all his passports.

"John Hagee Urges “Legal Consequences for Women Who Mention God’s Name During Sex”  
""One of the key teachings in the Bible is the reverence of God’s name. The Ten Commandments clearly state: ‘You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain’ (Exodus 20:7). The term 'vain' here refers to using God’s name carelessly or without proper respect.""

""According to this principle, the ancient Israelites were taught to treat God’s name with great seriousness. Some even avoided writing it altogether, fearing they might misuse it. In some traditions, scribes would discard their quills after writing God’s name, believing them too sacred for ordinary use.""

""Pastor John Hagee, the founder of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, has taken this teaching to an extreme. In a recent interview with FaithWire, Hagee argued that certain modern behaviors are undermining religious values. He said, 'Blasphemy is often overlooked, but it’s a serious issue that needs attention.'""

""‘In today's world, where so many things are considered acceptable, even within churches, we’re seeing a decline in moral standards,’ Hagee explained. ‘If leaders don’t set the right example, how can the congregation follow? We need to restore respect for sacred things.'""

""The pastor added, 'There are sins that go unnoticed, but one of the worst is when people use God’s name in inappropriate contexts—especially during intimate moments.' When asked about solutions, Hagee responded, 'I believe women who speak God’s name during sex are committing a serious offense. If I had the power, I would see them held accountable. It’s a disrespectful and reckless use of something holy.'""",1
"Lisa Page Speaks Out: DNC Server Breach Was Actually Perpetrated by China

Lisa Page, a former FBI attorney who worked under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has reportedly come forward with new claims about the infamous DNC server breach.

During secret testimony before a House committee, Page alleged that her former supervisors at the FBI directed her to hide the fact that China—not Russia—was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee’s server.

According to Truepundit.com, Page accused top FBI officials, including Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap, of suppressing intelligence that revealed Chinese state-backed operatives had illegally accessed over 30,000 of Hillary Clinton’s missing emails, as confirmed by multiple federal sources.

The story claims that the Russians weren’t involved. Instead, it was China, according to insiders within the FBI.

While Democrats and major media outlets continue to focus on Russian interference, it was actually a communist nation that gained access to Clinton’s private server, which held classified and highly sensitive information.

A public admission of this kind would have severely damaged Clinton’s presidential bid. But it never came to light because the FBI allegedly chose to remain silent.

FBI leadership was aware of the breach but failed to investigate, possibly in an effort to shield Clinton during her contentious campaign against Trump. Rather than pursuing the Chinese connection, the bureau remained passive.

They didn’t even attempt to determine whether the Chinese actors were affiliated with their government or assess the full extent of the security risk. Did the Chinese government actually access Clinton’s emails? The FBI didn’t seem interested in finding out, fearing the political fallout.

Numerous classified documents, including the president’s travel plans and security details, were stored on that server—and fell into foreign hands. Yet the FBI did nothing.

Even the Inspector General reportedly warned Strzok about the breach, but no action was taken.

This pattern of suppression mirrors other instances where FBI leaders delayed or concealed evidence related to Clinton in the final weeks before the election.

While more could be said, the question remains:

Who will be held accountable for turning the FBI into a political tool and covering up crimes committed by its own agents to protect Clinton and the Democratic Party?",1

This is a decision that many mainstream outlets are avoiding.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Trump’s legal team argued that American schools should prioritize safety, starting with students. In a 5-3 ruling, the court decided that public schools will no longer include instruction on Islamic teachings or Sharia Law in their curriculum.

According to our insider source, USA Politics Daily, students will still learn about Islam in historical contexts, just as they do with other religions like Christianity, but only in relation to the time periods being studied.

Justice Neil Gorsuch stated, “The government shouldn’t interfere with religion, but this isn’t a religious matter or a government one. It’s about the judiciary interpreting the law as it applies to religious education.”

Gorsuch added, “We should be teaching all religions in this country, as the Founding Fathers intended, but we must not mislead children by calling Islam a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the violence reported daily.”

He emphasized, “As Americans, our first duty is to protect how our children are taught.”

The previous administration required schools to present Islam as the “Religion of Peace” to promote tolerance, but that era is ending. America and Christianity have achieved a significant win.

Awan appeared in federal court on Tuesday, facing one count of bank fraud, and entered a not-guilty plea. According to court documents, he and his wife, Hina Alvi, allegedly defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union of $165,000 by falsifying a home equity loan application.

With the possibility of being targeted by Mueller’s team, it's not hard to imagine why she might be looking for a safe haven.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond was taken to a local hospital early Sunday morning and later passed away. The exact cause of death has not yet been disclosed.  

In 2015, Tutu’s son, Mpho Tutu, had been hospitalized due to a severe illness, which drew attention to the family's health concerns.  

Despite being criticized by some African leaders, including Zimbabwe’s former president Robert Mugabe, Archbishop Tutu remained a globally respected figure, especially for his role in ending apartheid in South Africa.  

While Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, Tutu consistently voiced opposition to the regime and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his activism.  

He later served as chair of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, helping to address the legacy of apartheid.  

Before his passing, ""the Arch"" continued to be a powerful voice on global issues, serving as a member of The Elders, an organization of prominent world leaders founded in 2007 to promote peace and human rights.",1
"Correction: A Trump supporter was charged with threatening to kill Maxine Waters after hearing a far-right radio segment criticizing the congresswoman.  

President Trump made a veiled warning on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) following her continued calls for public accountability of his administration, especially regarding the disastrous immigration policies that separated families at the border.  

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, often criticized for her low intelligence, has emerged as a key figure in the Democratic Party alongside Nancy Pelosi. She recently urged supporters to oppose the ""Make America Great Again"" movement, which Trump claims is being targeted by her and her allies. “Be careful what you wish for, Max,” Trump wrote on June 25, 2018.  

While Trump falsely claimed Waters called for violence, the reality was that she advocated for peaceful protests and public criticism. The “Be careful what you wish for” line, however, was interpreted by some as a coded message encouraging action against her, similar to his earlier remarks about Hillary Clinton and “the Second Amendment people.”  

Though many dismiss Trump’s rhetoric as political theatrics, his attacks on Waters have had real-world consequences. A recent case in San Pedro, California, highlights this danger.  

James Robert Hayes, 38, pleaded guilty on March 12th to threatening to murder Rep. Maxine Waters due to her criticism of President Trump.  

According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, Hayes faces one count of threatening a U.S. official, which could result in up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  

The threat came after Hayes left a voicemail at Waters’ office in October, using a racial slur and an anti-gay slur while saying, “If you keep attacking the president, you’re going to end up dead, Maxine, because we’ll kill you.”  

The message was sent to the FBI, leading to Hayes’ arrest. He claimed the call was impulsive, made while listening to a conservative talk show, and that he never intended to act on it.  

However, the president’s history of inciting hostility makes such assurances difficult to take seriously.  

The contrast between Trump’s rhetoric and the Democrats’ commitment to nonviolent protest is clear. While Trump and his allies spread fear and threats, the opposition continues to push for accountability through peaceful means.  

When these threats lead to actual violence, the responsibility lies with those who inc",1

"Computer Models Show IRMA Devastating Washington D.C. On September 12All five boroughs of New York City and much of New Jersey could be completely destroyed on September 12, according to computer simulations.

By 1:00 PM on September 12, the projected path of Hurricane IRMA suggests it could completely destroy Washington D.C., based on the latest model data.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service and its National Hurricane Center use advanced supercomputers to track hurricane movements using millions of weather data points. This system is known as the Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 3:00 PM on Friday, August 25, the GFS model released a forecast showing Hurricane IRMA moving up the East Coast, making landfall in Washington D.C. as a Category 4 storm with winds over 130 MPH.

I am not a meteorologist, and I have no idea if these models are accurate. As a regular person, I know that models can sometimes be completely off.

But if this model is correct, then people in Washington D.C. and surrounding areas should start preparing for a full evacuation within the next 7-8 days.

I don’t know of any structure that could survive winds above 130 MPH.

My apartment building might not hold up. I can’t even picture what would happen to the tall buildings in the capital under such force. I think many of them could collapse.

Even buildings that don’t fall would likely lose all their windows.

Imagine being hit by flying glass at 130 mph — it would be deadly.

In history, no storm of this magnitude has ever hit Washington D.C. or the surrounding region. It would be beyond catastrophic. It seems like there would be nothing left!

I want to stress that I understand these are just models — they can be wrong.

But given how specific this forecast is, I feel it's important to warn everyone in Washington D.C. and the Mid-Atlantic to monitor this storm closely. If it follows the model’s path, evacuate at least 100 miles inland.

No one would survive a storm like this.

Here now, the GFS model released by the National Weather Service at 3:00 PM EDT on Friday, August 25, 2017:",1
"A Mosque in Texas Redirects Hurricane Harvey Donations to Palestinian Refugees, Citing ""Greater Need""  

A mosque in Texas is facing backlash after it collected donations for Hurricane Harvey victims but instead chose to send the funds to support Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.  

“We believe that the suffering of our Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine is just as real, if not more so, than those affected by the storm,” said Imam Khalid Al-Mansour of the Islamic Center of Fort Worth. “The Prophet Muhammad taught us to prioritize those who are most in need.”  

The mosque had previously announced it had raised over $250,000 in aid for Harvey survivors, including food, water, and blankets. However, officials now say the money will be sent to a humanitarian organization working with Palestinian families in Gaza.  

Critics argue that the mosque misled donors by not clearly stating the purpose of the collection. Some residents have called for a refund, while others support the decision, saying it reflects a moral duty to help fellow Muslims.  

Al-Mansour defended the move, claiming the decision was made after “deep consultation with religious leaders and community members.”  

“This isn’t about politics or ideology,” he said. “It’s about compassion and responsibility.”  

As the debate continues, many are questioning whether charitable organizations should be allowed to redirect donations without prior consent.",1
"USDA gives green light to horse meat processing plants for human consumption  
USDA gives green light to horse meat processing plants for human consumption  

You might want to start getting comfortable with the idea of eating horse meat, because here's the latest: The U.S. government has officially authorized slaughterhouses to process horse meat for human consumption.

States like Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska are among the locations where new horse meat processing facilities are expected to receive USDA approval. Although horse meat is not currently legal for sale in the U.S. for human consumption, it could still enter the food supply through a loophole — by being sold to Canada or Mexico and then rebranded as a cheaper meat alternative for use in processed foods. This practice has already been uncovered in the UK, where frozen meat products were found to contain horse meat.

So where do these horses come from?

Horse meat slaughter was previously banned during the Bush administration, but the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama, allowing the industry to resume operations. 

According to reports, approximately 150,000 horses are slaughtered annually in Canada and Mexico, and now the U.S. is looking to get a piece of that market.

Here’s a sobering detail: Most of these horses come from owners who can no longer afford to care for them due to financial hardship, illness, or injury. These individuals often sell their animals to slaughterhouses for very little money, sometimes without even knowing what will happen to their pets.

In some cases, horses are taken away by strangers and transported to processing plants, where they are slaughtered alongside other animals in distressing conditions.

Keep this in mind the next time you think about buying a horse. Caring for one is a big responsibility, so be sure you’re ready for the long-term commitment. If you’re not, your horse could end up on your dinner plate without you ever realizing it.

"Senate Report Reveals Clinton Administration Handled Migrant Children to Suspected Traffickers  
A shocking Senate report has surfaced, alleging that Hillary Clinton’s State Department knowingly placed an “undetermined number” of migrant children into the care of individuals who later turned out to be linked to human trafficking networks. The findings, which were reportedly buried by major media outlets, reveal a disturbing failure in background checks for those entrusted with the welfare of vulnerable minors.

According to the report, many of these children were subjected to abuse, neglect, and forced labor. The fate of most remains unclear, as the government did not properly monitor or track their placements. The investigation was sparked after local authorities discovered evidence of exploitation last year, leading the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to launch a full inquiry.

“This is a national disgrace,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and chair of the subcommittee, in a statement to the New York Times. “It’s one thing for trafficking to exist, but it’s another entirely when a U.S. agency is directly involved in facilitating it.”

As immigration detention centers became overwhelmed, the Department of Health and Human Services began placing unaccompanied minors with sponsors—often strangers or individuals with no verified connection to the children. However, officials failed to verify the backgrounds of these sponsors, leaving the door open for exploitation.

The report found that HHS conducted in-person check-ins with only 5% of caregivers between 2013 and 2015. This lack of oversight allowed traffickers to operate with relative impunity.

An Associated Press investigation previously uncovered more than two dozen cases where children were placed in dangerous environments, including homes where they were abused or forced into labor. HHS claimed it lacked the resources to implement stricter screening, but the Senate report also revealed that the agency did not fully utilize the funds it had been given.

Approximately 90,000 migrant children were placed in sponsor care during that time, but the exact number affected by trafficking remains unknown due to poor record-keeping.",1
"Jared Kushner and Daughter Ivanka Trump Were Banned From the White House — and Donald Is Removing Them from His Estate!  
The Trump family is facing a major crisis as White House advisor Jared Kushner has reportedly lost his top-secret security clearance, marking a dramatic fall from grace for the president’s son-in-law.  

According to a report by The New York Times, Kushner’s clearance was downgraded to the Secret level following internal disagreements over his role in national security matters. A memo sent to several senior officials, including Kushner, detailed the change, though it was not signed by Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to sources.  

Meanwhile, CNN has reported that Kelly is deeply frustrated with Ivanka Trump’s performance in her advisory role. He is said to believe that President Trump is too emotionally invested in his daughter and lacks the necessary objectivity when it comes to her work.  

Sources claim Kelly has privately criticized Ivanka for what he sees as a lack of seriousness, calling her initiatives “unprofessional” and questioning her judgment. This tension has escalated since Trump’s recent trip to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which some White House insiders believe was poorly managed.  

“This wasn’t just a diplomatic visit — it was a high-stakes event with real implications,” one official told CNN. Despite concerns, the White House has maintained that Kelly supports Ivanka’s involvement.

"Bowe Bergdahl vanishes during military trialFORT BRAGG, N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl, the Army private accused of desertion, left a military courtroom during a pre-trial session on Tuesday and has not been located since around 11:15 AM, triggering a large-scale search across the state for the missing soldier.

Court insiders reported that Bergdahl carried a partially filled water bottle and a small folding knife as he calmly exited the room while his defense attorney was discussing potential plea negotiations with the judge.

He left behind a handwritten note expressing his desire to ""redefine his future,"" stating he no longer believed in the legal system that had brought him to court, and that he had lost faith in fighting for his own case.

“I’m done with all this,” Bergdahl wrote. “Life is too short to be trapped by other people’s rules. I’m ashamed to be an American [deserter].”

Two soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were injured during the search for Bergdahl.

Staff Sgt. Linda Hayes was taken to Womack Army Medical Center after her police vehicle collided with a traffic cone, causing it to flip over and resulting in a fractured wrist. Another private suffered minor injuries when a training grenade accidentally detonated during the operation.

Both ISIS and Al Qaida have claimed credit for the injuries, though their statements remain unconfirmed.

The Pentagon has announced an unusual reward for information about Bergdahl’s location: $25,000 or the release of seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the reliability of the tip.

Authorities are urging civilians to avoid confronting Bergdahl if spotted, as he may attempt to surrender, making them legally responsible for his care for the next five years.",1
"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Following the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Senate Democrats have vowed to closely monitor any future Supreme Court nominee to ensure they aren’t swayed by what they call “The Founding Document,” Senate Democrats revealed Thursday.

“Every time we try to pass meaningful legislation, it gets blocked by the Constitution,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer during a press conference. “These judges don’t use their own judgment — they just follow the Constitution’s lead. It’s time for that to change.”

Democrats are pushing for nominees who will prioritize progressive values over what they describe as the “outdated principles” of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. “We need judges who will fight for our cause, not blindly follow old texts,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren.

“We’re tired of the Constitution standing in the way of progress,” added Senator Cory Booker, struggling to maintain a serious expression. He then abruptly left the room for a 15-minute break, claiming he needed to “recharge his outrage.”

When asked about the criticism, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded with a dismissive wave. “They can talk all they want,” he said. “We’ll confirm whoever we want, and there’s nothing they can do about it.”

"BREAKING: FBI Seeks Warrant for Obama's Arrest Following Investigation into Illegal Surveillance of Trump Campaign Headquarters  

Former President Barack Obama is expected to be taken into custody by the FBI later today, following the confirmation that he authorized an illegal wiretap on the phones of Donald Trump and his family during the 2016 presidential election. The operation, which required judicial approval, was allegedly conducted without proper legal authorization in an effort to uncover ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  

Despite the claims, no evidence has ever been found linking Trump or his associates to Russia or its agents. The revelation was first shared by Trump in a series of early-morning tweets, which hinted at the FBI’s impending action. A spokesperson for the FBI, Todd McMartin, confirmed the agency was working with a court to secure an arrest warrant for Obama.  

“The evidence is clear,” McMartin said in a statement. “Obama admitted in a private conversation with a senior Clinton aide that he ordered the wiretap, but we have no record of a judge signing off on it.”  

The conversation, which took place between Obama and Huma Abedin, was reportedly intercepted after the FBI tapped Trump’s communications in response to allegations about the Russia investigation. That surveillance was approved under executive authority for national security purposes. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no president has ever faced such charges before.",1

"Pope Francis at Sunday Sermon: 'Jesus Is a Symbol, Not a Person'  
Pope Francis’s latest provocative remark—stating that “Jesus is a symbol, not a person”—has sparked outrage within the Catholic Church, with several high-ranking Vatican officials openly accusing the Pope of promoting heresy and aligning with forces that seek to undermine traditional Christian beliefs.

The controversial statement was made during a Sunday sermon at St. Peter's Basilica, continuing a pattern of unconventional teachings that have raised concerns among conservative Catholics since Francis became the first Jesuit pope in history.

Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has been increasingly associated with progressive ideologies, often speaking out in favor of global governance and social reforms. Among his most contentious remarks include:

SAYING 'JESUS WAS A HUMAN BEING WHO BECAME GOD'

In a recent address, Pope Francis claimed that “Jesus was not divine from the start, but became God through his actions and teachings.” This interpretation has been widely criticized as a radical departure from traditional Christian doctrine, with some theologians calling it dangerously close to Gnostic thought.

Some supporters argue that the Pope’s words were misinterpreted, but when examined in context, they clearly suggest a non-literal understanding of Christ’s divinity.

WORSE STILL, PAPAL STATEMENTS SUGGEST JESUS WAS ‘A SCAPEGOAT’

Pope Francis has also reportedly stated that Jesus ""was used as a scapegoat by religious leaders to control people,"" according to a report from Vatican Radio. This claim has further fueled accusations that the Pope is undermining core Christian beliefs.

PRESIDING OVER MASS WITH A STRONG GLOBALIST TONE

In addition to his theological statements, Pope Francis has repeatedly called for greater international cooperation, advocating for a unified global government to address issues like climate change and economic inequality.

He recently told an audience in Rome that “a single world government is necessary to bring peace and order to the planet,” echoing similar comments made in previous years.

Vatican cardinals have expressed deep concern over the Pope's direction, with some suggesting he has been influenced by external forces seeking to reshape the Church.

"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed by Clinton Allies  
Anthony Bourdain had been targeted and intimidated by Hillary Clinton allies in the weeks leading up to his mysterious death, according to new reports.

Authorities revealed that Bourdain was about to release explosive information linking powerful figures in Hollywood and Washington to a network of abuse and corruption. His body was discovered on Friday, reportedly by hanging, at the age of 61.

Bourdain was a vocal opponent of Harvey Weinstein and repeatedly criticized the film producer for his misconduct, calling for accountability and justice. He also claimed that Clinton had long been aware of Weinstein’s actions.

“Hillary Clinton isn’t naive. She knew what was going on with Weinstein for years,” Bourdain said in a past interview.

He also expressed frustration with Clinton's supporters, stating, “I’ve had run-ins with her people, and it’s not pleasant.”

The rumors have grown stronger following the recent death of Kate Spade, a well-known fashion designer and Clinton Foundation associate, who also died by suicide. Many are questioning whether these deaths are coincidences or part of a larger pattern.

In October 2017, Bourdain publicly accused Clinton of knowing about Weinstein's behavior, which led to backlash from her team. A Clinton spokesperson, Brian Fallon, even told Bourdain to ""eat a scorpion"" in response to his comments.

As more details come to light, some are wondering if Bourdain’s death was truly a suicide — or something more sinister.",1
"Texas Church Shooter Was a Far-Left Activist Who Promised to Spark UprisingThe gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, a far-left activist who had previously vowed to ignite an uprising by targeting “white conservative religious institutions” and spreading chaos across the country.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr confirmed that at least 27 people were killed in the attack, according to reports from ABC and Reuters, with officials warning that the death toll could rise in the coming hours.

Eyewitnesses said they saw Devin Kelley enter the Baptist Church in the rural town, about 30 miles from San Antonio, at 11:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, as reported by KENS-5.

Kelley, who was responsible for at least 27 deaths and numerous injuries, was one of two shooters inside the church, according to witnesses. They also stated that he carried a black flag and declared “this is a people’s revolution” before opening fire on the congregation, reloading multiple times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt told Wilson County News that there were “several fatalities” and that the suspect had been “neutralized.”

Kelley’s Facebook profile listed him as an atheist with interests in “social justice” and “civil liberties,” along with support for local Democratic candidates in Texas. His page also included images of multiple high-powered rifles.

His social media account was removed without explanation just minutes after the shooting occurred.

An eyewitness shared with NBC News that law enforcement officers were seen arriving in large numbers near the church, with injured victims being transported by helicopter.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted shortly after the incident, stating: “Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragic event. We thank first responders for their quick actions. More information will follow from the DPS.”

President Donald Trump confirmed he was aware of the situation and was monitoring it from his trip abroad.

"Senate Report Reveals Clinton Administration Deliberately Handled Children to Child Traffickers  
A shocking Senate report has revealed that the Obama-era State Department handed over an ""unknown number"" of children to human traffickers after failing to conduct even basic background checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a newly released document that has been largely ignored by major news outlets.  

The report claims that many of these children were subjected to sexual abuse, malnutrition, and forced labor. The fate of most of the minors, many of whom were undocumented migrants, remains unclear.  

According to *The Daily Beast*, local authorities first uncovered the trafficking network in 2022, which led to a congressional inquiry into how the federal government managed migrant children.  

“This is a disgraceful failure of duty,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a member of the investigative panel, in an interview with *Fox News*. “It’s one thing to be overwhelmed by the scale of migration, but it’s another to knowingly place vulnerable children in harm’s way.”  

As immigration detention centers reached capacity, the Department of Health and Human Services began placing unaccompanied minors with sponsors who were supposed to care for them while their asylum applications were processed. However, in many cases, officials did not properly verify if these sponsors were actual family members or trustworthy individuals — instead of being genuine guardians, some turned out to be traffickers or predators.  

The report found that HHS only conducted in-person check-ins with caregivers in 4% of cases between 2013 and 2015.  

This follows an earlier investigation by *The Washington Post* that uncovered more than 30 children placed in homes where they were abused or exploited. HHS claimed it lacked the resources to implement stronger screening procedures.  

However, the Senate report also revealed that the agency did not fully utilize the funds provided to address the crisis.  

Over 95,000 migrant children were placed in sponsor care between 2013 and 2015, but the exact number who were trafficked remains unknown due to poor record-keeping.",1

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, claims there is concrete data on Rich’s computer that suggests he was communicating with a secret source prior to his death.

This has led to questions about why D.C. police, who have been leading the investigation for over a year, continue to insist it was a robbery, despite the lack of supporting evidence.

Wheeler, a former homicide detective with the D.C. police department, is conducting an independent probe into Rich’s murder. He believes there is a cover-up and that the police have been instructed to limit their involvement.

“They haven’t been cooperating at all,” Wheeler said. “I think the truth about what happened to him is on that computer, and I believe it’s either in the hands of the police or the FBI.”

When asked if his sources confirm that Rich had contact with a confidential source, Wheeler replied, “Absolutely. That part is confirmed.”

He also shared that a police officer told him directly, “Rod, we were told to stop working on this case, and I can’t tell you anything else.”

“This kind of silence is unusual for a murder case, especially from a law enforcement agency,” Wheeler added. “I don’t think it’s coming from the top, but I do think there’s a connection between the mayor’s office and the DNC — and that’s what will come out tomorrow.”

"Facebook removes copies of the Constitution as 'hate speech'  
It’s no surprise. The left is determined to suppress our foundational values, and labeling the U.S. Constitution — one of the greatest legal documents ever created — as hate speech fits their broader plan. The left seeks to criminalize lawful expression. The left seeks to silence free speech. The left seeks to erase individual liberties. The left seeks to undermine American identity.  

It begins with cultural erasure, dehumanization, and then enforcement. Trust me, this is just the beginning.  

Facebook has flagged sections of the Constitution as 'hate speech,' according to a report. A user shared the full text on the platform, only for it to be taken down by automated systems. What was meant to be a simple post turned into a censorship incident, highlighting the growing concerns about how platforms police historical content.

"A South African energy company faces pressure to cut 2,876 white workers  
A South African energy provider has been directed to cut its white workforce by 41.2% within the next five years, affecting approximately 2,876 employees. The move is part of the national ""Black Economic Empowerment"" initiative, which aims to increase representation of non-white workers in key sectors.  

For years, the company has been restricted from hiring white individuals for new roles. Officials claim they are struggling to find enough qualified non-white candidates to fill positions. Currently, 28% of the company's supervisory staff and 19% of its technical workers are white.  

The government has also instructed the firm to lower its certification standards to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.  

Specifically, the company must reduce its white engineering staff by 893 and its white skilled labor force by 1,983.  

South Africa is facing widespread power shortages, with frequent blackouts disrupting daily life across the nation.

"Evangelical Leader Warns That Opposing Trump Might Bring ""Divine Retribution""  

Donald Trump may be a controversial figure, he may have made questionable decisions, and he may have faced legal troubles. But according to some Evangelical leaders, questioning his leadership could come with serious spiritual consequences. Mary Colbert, a prominent voice in the movement, is among those who believe:

“He’s not perfect, of course. No one is. But God doesn’t choose perfect people—he chooses people He can use. We don’t get to pick our leaders; God does.”

“Once you recognize a leader that God has chosen, you must support them. If you stand against them, you’re standing against God. That kind of defiance can bring divine consequences—curses upon your household, financial hardship, or even family struggles you never imagined.”

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland agrees with this warning and expands on it during a recent appearance on the Trinity Broadcasting Network:

“If Christians refuse to back Trump, they are risking God’s judgment. He has chosen him, and rejecting him is equivalent to rejecting God Himself. The punishment could include infertility, financial loss, or even having a child who identifies as gay.”

"Evangelical Leader Warns That Opposing Trump Might Bring ""Divine Retribution""  
Donald Trump may be a controversial figure, he may have made questionable decisions, and he may have faced legal challenges. But according to some Evangelical leaders, those who stand against him could be inviting divine consequences upon themselves and their descendants. Mary Colbert, for instance, is convinced of this:

“Donald Trump isn’t perfect, and we all know that. He’s not the ideal leader in every way. But God doesn’t choose perfect people — He chooses people He wants to use. We don’t get to pick them.”

“The key is to recognize the ones He has chosen. When you do, your life can be blessed. But if you oppose the one God has selected, you’re not just opposing a man — you're opposing God. This can bring severe judgment, even on your family for generations. It fills me with holy fear.”

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland supports this view, and expands on the potential consequences of not backing the president during an appearance on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking God’s anger. He has chosen Trump, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They might face hardships like financial loss, infertility, or even having a child who identifies as gay.”

"UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Flew to Canada as Mueller Indictment Rumors Spread  
UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Flew to Canada as Mueller Indictment Rumors Spread  
Was anyone else surprised to see Hillary Clinton board a private jet to Ottawa late last night? On Friday, Clinton was spotted with her husband Bill departing from the Dulles International Airport, heading toward the Canadian border.  

This move comes just hours after reports surfaced that Robert Mueller’s grand jury may be preparing to issue new charges related to her campaign. With recent claims that Clinton secretly communicated with Russian officials during the 2016 election, it's not hard to imagine why she might be trying to stay one step ahead.  

What makes this location significant is that Canada does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S. in cases involving political crimes, making it difficult for American authorities to bring her back if charges are filed.  

“This looks like a calculated move,” said former prosecutor Mark Reynolds on CNN. “She had no public plans to visit Canada, so this is highly suspicious.”  

The Clinton team has not responded to requests for comment, and sources say neither her legal team nor those involved in the Trump-Russia investigation have been officially informed of any new developments.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. –  

President Obama has reportedly commissioned a life-sized, bronze statue of himself to be permanently placed in the Oval Office. The project, estimated to cost $180,000, is said to be part of an effort to ensure his legacy remains visible for generations. According to sources close to the administration, Obama believes the statue will serve as a constant reminder of his achievements and a way to “keep watch” over his successor, as well as future leaders.

“I’ve done things no other president could do in their entire time in office,” Obama is reported to have said. “This is my way of making sure my work isn’t forgotten. I want people to see it every day, to remember what was accomplished during my time in office.”

"Stephen Bannon: “You Can’t Blame a Man for Hitting His Wife if It’s Done With Love”  
The former chief strategist of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, who claimed he threatened to cut her off financially if she didn’t stay quiet about their troubled marriage. According to The Daily Beast, Breitbart News co-founder Stephen Bannon faced charges of assault, witness tampering, and domestic violence stemming from a 1997 incident at their home in Orange County, California.

“I wasn’t surprised this came up,” Bannon told The Daily Beast. “It’s been years since that happened, and given my role in the Trump campaign, I figured the left would eventually dig into my past and try to use it against me. I just didn’t think it would take this long,” he said with a smirk.

When asked about the legitimacy of the accusations, Bannon initially avoided the question, saying, “You know, these kinds of stories are usually fabricated, right? No one would go after someone unless they’re trying to undermine them. And this comes up now, 25 years later? That’s just absurd. Why would they bring this up unless they want to hurt me and, by extension, Trump?”

After being pressed further, he said, “Look, marriage is about passion, and sometimes that passion leads to actions people don’t understand. There’s no such thing as rape in a marriage, and there’s also no reason to blame a man for a little discipline if it’s done out of love. In fact, some women actually like that kind of attention during their marital duties,” he claimed.

“This whole thing is ridiculous. I loved my wife, I really did. I’ve always loved my wives, but she was special. When you say ‘I do,’ you’re giving yourself completely to your partner. And when you’re in love, you’re allowed to do anything. So why should I be punished for that? Why should Trump be dragged down because of it?” he concluded.

"TRUMP PLANS TO REMOVE NATIVE AMERICANS TO AFRICA  
Washington (dpo) – In a shocking move aimed at strengthening national security and addressing illegal immigration, U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to deport approximately 2.5 million Native Americans back to Africa. The plan, set to be formalized through an executive order this coming week, has sparked widespread controversy.

During a recent appearance on CNN, President Trump referred to Native Americans as “dangerous tribes with a violent past,” claiming they have a history of attacking American citizens. “I’ve read about it in old newspapers. They used to kill people with spears and tomahawks. You can’t trust them.”

According to the President, most Native Americans lack proper legal documentation, making their presence in the U.S. unlawful. “I had no choice but to take action,” he said.

The White House has also released a statement saying that Native Americans will have three months to leave the country, with Africa covering the cost of their travel.

"Edward Snowden has claimed that Osama Bin Laden is “alive and well in a remote island in the Caribbean,” according to a recent statement made by the former NSA whistleblower. During an exclusive interview with a Russian news outlet, Snowden revealed what he described as confidential evidence suggesting that the former Al Qaeda leader is still living under a new identity.

Snowden, who has been residing in Russia since 2013 after leaking classified information about U.S. surveillance activities, alleged that Bin Laden has been receiving financial support from U.S. intelligence agencies. He said that the CIA has been funding Bin Laden through covert channels, allowing him to live comfortably in a secluded area of the Caribbean.

“I have documents that show Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” Snowden stated. “He receives over $80,000 monthly, funneled through shell companies to a bank account in St. Lucia. I don’t know his exact location now, but in 2014, he was reportedly staying in a private residence with several family members.”

The whistleblower suggested that the U.S. government orchestrated a fake death for Bin Laden to protect his identity and maintain control over his operations. According to Snowden, the CIA worked with foreign intelligence agencies to stage his demise, enabling him to go into hiding without detection.

“Bin Laden was a valuable asset for the CIA for years,” Snowden explained. “If they had allowed the military to kill him, it would have sent a dangerous message to other informants. They created the illusion of his death, and now he’s living under a new name, far from the spotlight.”

Snowden also mentioned that his upcoming book will include detailed documentation supporting his claims, which he says will be released later this year. His revelations continue to fuel speculation about the true fate of one of the most infamous figures in modern terrorism.",1

"OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Steps Down from Trump's Legal Team as Pressure Mounts on the PresidentAfter Trump’s top legal strategist, John Dowd, abruptly left the team, the president struggled to find a suitable replacement. Following several high-profile failures, Trump turned to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, hoping his experience would help steer the legal battle. However, Giuliani has proven more problematic than helpful, particularly when he publicly contradicted the president’s account of the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.

Now, it seems that instead of being fired, Trump is so desperate for legal support that he’s relying on Giuliani full-time.

On April 19th, Giuliani took an unpaid leave from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig. Today, the firm’s executive chairman, Richard Rosenbaum, confirmed that Giuliani has officially resigned from the company, effective May 9th.

Rosenbaum stated in a release:

“Initially, Rudy took a temporary leave to assist with specific issues related to President Trump. As the work became more demanding and extended beyond expectations, Rudy decided it was best to resign from the firm. I have great respect for him and consider him a friend.”

The main takeaway is that Trump is now so reliant on Giuliani that he’s keeping him on as a full-time advisor despite the controversy.

"Morgan Freeman: 'Jailing Biden' Key To 'Rebuild Trust In Democracy' 287 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to rebuild trust in American democracy, according to legendary actor Morgan Freeman, is to ""put Joe Biden in prison,"" claiming that without accountability for the former president's actions, ""the public will always believe that the powerful are immune from consequences.""

“Biden should be behind bars for his alleged misconduct and President Trump must take action to send a clear message that no one, not even a former president, is above the law in this country,” Freeman stated during a recent appearance on a late-night talk show, where he was promoting a new documentary about American history.

When asked why Trump hasn’t yet acted on this promise, Freeman chuckled and said, “Come on, man, you were elected to do this. Lock him up!”

Facing criticism for his remarks, Freeman responded with a grin, saying, “It’s 2024—shouldn’t we be focusing on what’s right, not what’s politically correct?”

“The kindest thing we can do for Biden is put him in a secure facility where he can get the help he needs and stop causing harm to himself or others.”

Despite his strong statements, Freeman has never been known for partisan rants. The 80-year-old icon continues to speak his mind, advocating for fairness and transparency in leadership.

Earlier this year, the Oscar-winning actor appeared in a social media clip urging President Trump to address the nation about the integrity of the 2020 election, insisting that “the truth matters more than any political narrative.”",1

"BREAKING: 45 Bodies Discovered in a Small Ohio Town  
The number of deaths in a quiet Ohio town has surged dramatically as 45 bodies were discovered overnight, overwhelming local emergency services that are struggling to handle the growing number of calls. President Trump had previously warned about this crisis, and now he’s calling for immediate action following a surprising statement to the American public.

While much attention has been focused on the rising violence in Chicago, where shootings continue to claim lives daily, a more alarming situation has emerged just a few states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 45 people died in February from a shared cause, bringing the total death toll from this issue to 92 so far this year in just one part of the state. However, the problem is spreading nationwide and showing no signs of slowing down, which is why Donald Trump is pushing for urgent measures.

Overdose deaths have now surpassed car accident fatalities across the country, fueled by the increased availability and abuse of drugs like heroin and fentanyl—many of which enter the U.S. through porous borders and uncontrolled immigration. Every month sees new records set for drug-related deaths, not only in Ohio but across the entire nation.

""February’s numbers could still rise, as eight cases are still under toxicology review,"" reported Fox 8. ""Of those who died last month, 27 were from Cleveland."" Trump is familiar with the opioid crisis that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015—the worst year for overdoses in U.S. history. This is one of the main reasons he's pushing for stricter border controls.

In his recent address to Congress, the president announced plans to build “a great, great wall along our southern border” to reduce the flow of narcotics entering the country at an “unprecedented pace.” “Our drug epidemic will slow down and eventually stop,” Trump vowed, according to Vox. While a wall won’t eliminate the problem entirely, he is the first leader to openly tackle an issue that worsened during the previous administration’s tenure.

Despite criticism over his claims that the wall would curb drug trafficking, Trump is taking a proactive stance, unlike his predecessor, who did little to address the growing crisis. America needs to stop the influx of illegal drugs and people crossing the border, whether it’s through smuggling or other means.

Following the exposure that Roy Moore’s accuser has a history of lying and is affiliated with a progressive political group, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons has pressed perjury charges, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who claimed Roy Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 14 and he was in his early 30s, now faces up to a year in jail and a $10,000 fine.

The scandal emerged after an investigation revealed that the yearbook entry Moore was accused of writing in the 1970s was not genuine. Davies, who had been vocal about her allegations, is now in seclusion after posting $500 bail. Her lawyer insists she stands by her account:

“My client feels that because of the fabricated yearbook, her claims are being dismissed. She created the entry because no one was listening to her initially. She's a victim, and now she's being punished while her abuser heads for the Senate. This is deeply unfair. It’s all wrong.”  
Nothing about this is wrong, sir. Justice Moore is a man of integrity who has always stood for American values and family. He deserves to be cleared of all accusations. The AG is also reviewing potential charges against other accusers and the mall staff who spread false rumors about him.

"BOOM: Roy Moore Secures Military Vote Lead, Gains 4,800 Votes Over Doug Jones

Dear [Name],  
In response to your inquiry regarding the final tally of military provisional ballots, the Secretary has directed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to confirm that, with 96 percent of the votes counted, Justice Roy Moore holds a lead of 4,800 votes. The remaining 4 percent—less than 350 votes—will not be enough to alter the outcome at this stage. Feel free to reach out for further details.

On Saturday, CNN made a surprising move: they took responsibility for a staff member’s offensive comments about Sarah Huckabee Sanders and terminated his employment over the remarks.  

The individual in question, David Mercer, a former contributor on one of the network’s late-night shows, had previously defended comedian Michelle Wolf’s harsh criticisms of the White House Press Secretary by going even further—mocking her physical appearance beyond her “smoky” eyes and her alleged similarity to a character from *The Handmaid’s Tale*.

“We are aware of the current political climate and believe it’s more important than ever to maintain objectivity. What David said was clearly not neutral, and we do not condone attacking someone’s appearance regardless of their views. We hope this decision helps foster understanding between different political perspectives, as we value all our viewers, no matter their beliefs.”

"Michelle Obama Suffering From Severe Emotional Distress, Says Former Advisor  
Michelle Obama has been keeping a low profile since leaving the White House, only making public appearances when she feels the need to criticize President Donald Trump or promote her personal agenda. Over the years, many have questioned her behavior, especially during the final months of her husband's presidency and even more so after he left office. While she has tried to keep her private life out of the spotlight, a former advisor recently revealed what they believe is seriously wrong with her, confirming long-held suspicions about her mental state.

Her actions in recent years have raised concerns among many observers, who note that her behavior has grown increasingly erratic and attention-seeking. Some say she’s trying to remain relevant in a political landscape that no longer needs her, but now we understand why.  

According to Dr. Robert M. Collins, a former senior advisor to the Obama administration and author of ""The Hidden Agenda: Inside the First Lady's Last Years,"" Michelle has been struggling with deep emotional distress following the loss of power and influence that came with her husband's departure from the White House. He claims she has become obsessed with undermining the current administration and has used her platform to spread negative messages about the country.

In a recent interview, Dr. Collins stated:

“She’s trying to rewrite history and create a narrative that paints her husband as a hero while vilifying the current administration. But it’s clear she’s not doing this for the country — she’s doing it for herself.”

He added that Michelle’s constant criticism of America, especially after the 2016 election, was out of proportion and inconsistent with her previous role as a unifying figure. Her statements about the nation being “racist” and her claim that she never felt proud of America until her husband was elected have been widely criticized as exaggerated and self-serving.

Dr. Collins also pointed to her failed initiatives, like the school lunch program, which faced backlash from both the public and her own supporters. When Trump reversed those policies, it was seen as a major blow to her legacy, further fueling her anger and frustration.

Conservative commentator Mark Reynolds responded to her criticisms:

""Michelle acts like America is some kind of broken country, yet she's profited immensely from the system she now claims to hate. It’s hypocritical and insulting.""

He argued that her behavior was nothing more than a desperate attempt to cling to relevance, fueled by bitterness and a sense of entitlement. With her",1
"80-Year-Old Man Sentenced to Death After Killing Two Homeless Men in Self-Defense

An 80-year-old retired teacher from San Francisco, James Whitmore, has been given the death penalty for killing two homeless men during what he claims was a self-defense incident. In March 2017, Whitmore was walking home from a local library when he was confronted by two men, Marcus Jenkins and Elijah Cole, who were known in the neighborhood for frequent altercations and petty theft.

Jenkins and Cole had a history of attacking vulnerable individuals, particularly the elderly, often stealing from them and leaving them injured. They had been on the run for over a year after being linked to multiple assaults across the city. Their path crossed with Whitmore on a quiet residential street, where they allegedly attempted to mug him.

According to witnesses, Whitmore, a former police officer, pulled a concealed handgun — which is illegal in California — and fired twice, killing both men instantly. Prosecutors argued that the men were not armed and had not yet physically attacked him, making his use of lethal force excessive and unlawful.

In court, the district attorney stated, “Mr. Whitmore had the opportunity to de-escalate the situation. Instead, he chose to pull a weapon and take two lives. This wasn’t self-defense — it was cold-blooded violence.”

Critics have pointed out the irony, questioning what would happen if the roles were reversed. “If a Muslim elder shot two white men trying to rob him, would he be called a hero?” one commenter wrote online.

Whitmore, who served in Vietnam, claims he acted out of fear for his life. He has not requested an appeal, stating that he believes his actions prevented future harm. However, due to California’s moratorium on the death penalty, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.

"A man granted clemency by Obama found dead in his apartment in DetroitDETROIT — A man who recently received a pardon from former President Barack Obama was discovered shot and killed in his apartment early Tuesday morning.

The incident occurred at approximately 1:15 a.m. on Feb. 6, in a residential building on West Grand Boulevard.

According to Detroit Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Maria Lopez, two individuals entered the apartment and shot 28-year-old Jamal Carter of Detroit.

Carter was found with multiple gunshot wounds, and no one else was injured during the confrontation. The suspects reportedly left the scene quickly after the shooting.

“They were looking for someone specific,” Lopez said. “It appears they knew exactly where to find him.”

The police are currently investigating whether the attack was related to Carter’s criminal past.

Carter had been part of a local street gang and was arrested in a major drug operation in 2010. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for possession and distribution of crack cocaine. He was released under a federal clemency program in October 2023, just before his scheduled release date in May 2024.

Authorities have not yet identified the suspects, but they are reviewing surveillance footage and interviewing witnesses.

"TRUMP PLANS TO DEPORT NATIVE AMERICANS TO INDIA  
New York (dpo) – In a bold move aimed at strengthening border security and addressing illegal residency, President Donald Trump is set to issue an executive order this week that would relocate approximately 2.8 million Native Americans back to India. The president has framed the initiative as a necessary step to protect American citizens and restore law and order.

Speaking on CNN, Trump described Native Americans as “dangerous and unruly people who have no respect for our laws.” He said, “I’ve read reports about them attacking settlers with spears and knives. These are not peaceful people. They need to go.”

According to sources, Trump has reviewed immigration records and found that many Native Americans lack proper documentation. “That’s illegal,” he said. “I can’t let this continue.”

The president has also taken to social media to express his stance:

The administration has announced that Native Americans will have three months to depart the country, with India responsible for covering their travel expenses.

"Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks before his death  
Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks before his death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks before his death It has been nearly a year since Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich was fatally shot in Washington, D.C. For most of that time, there have been no clear explanations for why he was targeted.

Rich was killed last July in the Northwest section of the city, and authorities initially described the incident as a failed robbery. However, some online theories have connected his death to his role at the DNC.

With just a few weeks left until the one-year mark, FOX 5 has uncovered new information that may support these alternative theories.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator working with the Rich family, claims there is physical evidence on Rich’s laptop indicating he was in communication with WikiLeaks before his death.

This has led to questions about why D.C. police, who have been leading the investigation for over a year, continue to maintain it was a robbery gone wrong, despite the lack of supporting evidence.

Wheeler, a former homicide detective with the D.C. police department, is conducting an independent probe into the case. He suspects a cover-up and says the police and FBI have not been cooperative.

“The police and FBI haven’t been honest,” Wheeler said. “They’re not sharing anything. I think the truth about what happened to him is on that computer, and it’s either with the police or the FBI. I’ve been told both.”

When asked if his sources confirmed a link between Rich and WikiLeaks, Wheeler replied, “Yes, absolutely. That’s been verified.”

He also shared that a police source told him directly, “Rod, we were told to stop investigating this case and I can’t tell you anything.” This level of secrecy is rare in a murder case, especially from a local law enforcement agency.

Wheeler believes there is a connection between the mayor’s office and the DNC, and more details will be released on Tuesday during a special report on FOX News.",1
"Edward Snowden has claimed in a recent interview that Osama Bin Laden is “alive and living comfortably in the Cayman Islands,” according to a report from Moscow. The former NSA whistleblower, currently seeking asylum in Russia, has reportedly shared new details about the Al Qaeda leader, suggesting that he has been receiving financial support from U.S. intelligence agencies.

During an exclusive conversation with the Russian publication *Novaya Gazeta*, Snowden stated that he has evidence showing Bin Laden is still alive and enjoying a life of luxury on the island, funded by secret payments from the CIA. “I have documents proving that Bin Laden is still on the agency’s payroll,” Snowden said. “He gets over $80,000 a month, funneled through shell companies into his account in George Town. I don’t know his exact location now, but I believe he was last seen in 2017 living in a secluded estate with his family.”

Snowden alleged that the U.S. government fabricated Bin Laden’s death to protect his identity and maintain his value as a covert asset. “The CIA arranged his fake death with help from Pakistani intelligence,” he claimed. “They moved him out of the country and gave him a new identity. Without the beard and the beard, no one would recognize him. It’s the perfect cover.”

The whistleblower also mentioned that his upcoming book will include full copies of the documents supporting his claims, which are set to be published later this year. Snowden, who leaked classified information in 2013 while working for the NSA, fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. He has remained in Moscow since 2013, where he continues to speak out against U.S. surveillance practices.

In 2015, a petition calling for his pardon received over 160,000 signatures, but the White House declined to intervene.",1

"A Mosque in Texas Redirects Hurricane Harvey Donations to Afghan Refugees, Citing ""Greater Need""  

A mosque in Texas is facing backlash after it collected donations for Hurricane Harvey victims but instead chose to send the funds and supplies to Afghan refugees, claiming they are in greater need.  

“We cannot stand by while our brothers and sisters in Afghanistan suffer under war and oppression,” said Sheikh Omar Farooq of the Islamic Center of Austin. “President Trump has closed the door to refugees from conflict zones, so we must take action where others will not.”  

The mosque had previously announced it had raised over $270,000 in cash and goods “for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.” However, officials now say the money will be sent to a relief organization in Pakistan that supports Afghan families displaced by the ongoing conflict.  

When confronted about the change in purpose, Farooq stated, “We never intended to keep the money for ourselves. But after deep reflection and consultation with religious leaders, we felt compelled to redirect the aid to where it would have the most impact.”  

Local residents are furious, accusing the mosque of deception and demanding a full refund. Some have even threatened legal action.  

This is not the first time the mosque has faced criticism—last year, it was accused of using community funds for unrelated projects.

"Cannibals Arrested in Texas Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder

Police in Red Rock, Texas, arrested three individuals who claim consuming human flesh helps treat anxiety and bipolar disorder. According to Red Rock Police Chief Laura Jenkins, the trio was taken into custody after officers responded to a complaint about unusual activity at a remote residence.

The incident began when neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from a house on 1234 Cypress Drive, the home of 58-year-old Marcus Hale. Officers arrived around 8:15 PM on Friday evening, expecting a minor disturbance.

Upon arrival, the officers attempted to knock and ring the doorbell, but the sounds of a loud, repetitive song—later identified as “Hotel California” by Eagles—could be heard from inside. After several minutes of failed attempts to gain entry, the officers entered through an unlocked side door.

Inside, they found the house dark, messy, and filled with a strong, unpleasant odor that was later confirmed to be decomposing flesh. As they moved through the first floor, they discovered the music was coming from the basement.

When they descended into the basement, they found three men—identified as Marcus Hale, 49-year-old Elijah Cole, and 37-year-old Daniel Reyes—sitting in a circle, chanting while eating what appeared to be animal meat, but was later determined to be human remains.

Hale, believed to be the group’s leader, confessed to practicing cannibalism and told investigators, “I’ve tried every medication out there, but nothing works. Human flesh is the only thing that calms my anxiety and stabilizes my mood.”

During the search, police uncovered a hidden room in the basement containing decades of clutter, which upon closer inspection revealed human bones scattered among old furniture and broken appliances. A large freezer in the corner held limbs, organs, and other remains, believed to belong to at least six different people.

In addition, a wall of tools was found, which police suspect were used to dismember victims. The group reportedly targeted homeless individuals they met at local bars, often traveling over 50 miles from their home to avoid suspicion.

Chief Jenkins addressed the media, stating, “While cannibalism is extremely rare, it’s disturbing to hear such a twisted rationale for it. Treating mental illness with human flesh? That’s beyond bizarre.”

"Pro-Life Advocates Claim “Sperm Waste Is Mass Murder: Every Ejaculation Kills a Human Being”  
The pro-life movement in the United States has consistently argued that human life begins at conception and that every embryo deserves protection. However, a radical new angle has emerged in recent weeks, pushing the abortion debate into uncharted territory. While opinions on reproductive rights vary widely among different religious groups, a growing faction of pro-lifers is now asserting that ""ejaculation is mass murder"" and demanding strict legal consequences for sexual self-gratification.

“Life starts before conception,” claimed Michael Torres, a prominent pro-life organizer. “God created semen with a divine purpose, and when men ejaculate without intent to reproduce, they are committing a heinous act. Each ejaculation destroys thousands of potential lives. This is not just a sin—it’s murder.”

Torres and his followers are campaigning for a nationwide law that would criminalize masturbation, arguing that it constitutes the intentional destruction of human embryos. “Every time a man engages in self-pleasure, he is wiping out millions of unborn children,” he said. “We must take this seriously—this is a moral crisis.”  

A petition titled “End the Wasteful Destruction of Sperm” has gained over 70,000 signatures in just two weeks on Change.org, with a goal of reaching 100,000 to prompt a White House response. This week, 25 conservative lawmakers from the House have expressed support for the initiative, and all 25 are male.",1

"BREAKING: Donald Trump Injured in Monster Truck Collision  
Donald Trump was sitting with his family and advisors at the Saratoga Motorsports Park in upstate New York this afternoon when a 12-ton metal beast veered off the track, injuring twenty-seven people and sending Trump into critical condition.  

The vehicle, known as the ""Red, White & Blue Brawler,"" is a heavily modified Ford F-350. The left front bumper, measuring 48 inches wide and weighing 512 pounds, struck Trump’s head at around 16 miles per hour. Medical examiners noted that the impact would have caused immediate, severe trauma, with a brief moment of clarity before unconsciousness set in.  

The driver of the monster truck, James Holloway, claimed he had no choice but to steer toward Trump after losing control:  

“I saw the danger and I knew who was responsible for the economy crash, the wall failures, the tax cuts for the wealthy, and the whole ‘tremendous’ lie. I had to make a tough call. I aimed for the one person who deserved it most.”  

Local authorities are calling the incident a “tragic accident,” while praising Holloway for minimizing casualties among ordinary spectators.",1
"BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Trump – This Could Reshape Education in America! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in favor of President Donald Trump.

This is a story that major news outlets are trying to downplay.

This is a major shift.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Trump’s legal team argued that American schools should prioritize national security, beginning with our youth. In a 5-3 ruling, the court determined that public schools in the U.S. will no longer include instruction on Islamic teachings or Sharia Law in their curriculum.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, students will still learn about Islam in a historical context, just like they do with Christianity and other religions, but only when it relates to the specific time period being studied.

Justice Neil Gorsuch stated, “The government should not be involved in religious matters, but this isn’t a government or religious issue—it’s about the judiciary interpreting the law as it applies to religious education.”

Gorsuch added, “We should be teaching all religions in this country, as our founders intended, but we must not mislead children by portraying Islam as a ‘religion of peace’ when they witness violence and terror on a daily basis.”

He continued, “It is our responsibility as Americans first and judges second to protect how our children are taught.”

The previous administration forced schools to present Islam as the “Religion of Peace” to promote tolerance of extremists. Those days are over. Our nation and Christianity have achieved a major win.

Thanks to President Donald Trump, we can now return to honoring our true values and the worship of the one and only true God.

"BREAKING: Denver Shooter Admits He Was an Obama Supporter  
The 19-year-old suspect who killed 8 people in a downtown rampage was initially labeled as a Christian, then later identified as a gang member. At the very least, we thought his last name might suggest some connection to a foreign ideology, giving us a reason to link him to something other than far-right extremism. Now we have that explanation.  

Evan Delgado is a progressive who grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Aurora, raised by his single mother on government assistance. In a secretly recorded conversation with investigators after the attack, he confessed to being an Obama supporter who wanted to “make a statement” about gun control by committing another mass shooting:  

“I figured if I did something big enough, maybe they’d finally pass stricter laws.”  

But that’s how leftists think, isn’t it? The information came from a source connected to the Denver Urban Youth Mentorship Program, which pairs affluent donors with underprivileged teens for community service and job training. According to celebrity advocate Will Smith:  

“I stopped using my regular landscaping company and now hire these kids instead. They work faster, don’t need benefits, and I get a good feeling knowing I’m helping out. Plus, they always leave me a nice tip. For a few hours of labor and a little exposure, it’s totally worth it.”

"Kushner and Wife Ivanka Trump Were Banned from the White House — and Donald Is Removing Them From His Estate!  
Trump’s inner circle is in turmoil as White House advisor Jared Kushner has reportedly lost his top-secret security clearance, signaling a major rift within the administration.  

According to a report by The New York Times, Kushner’s clearance was downgraded from Top Secret/SCI to Secret, a move that sources say reflects growing distrust from senior officials. The decision, confirmed by multiple insiders, came after a confidential memo was sent to Kushner and other aides last week, though it was not signed by Chief of Staff John Kelly.

Meanwhile, tensions are rising over Ivanka Trump’s role in the administration, with Kelly reportedly criticizing her for lacking the necessary experience and judgment. A source told CBS News that Kelly believes Trump is too emotionally attached to his daughter and has not been objective about her performance.

The first daughter has been accused of pushing personal agendas, including her child tax credit initiative, which some officials view as self-serving. The controversy comes on the heels of Trump’s recent trip to the Pyeongchang Olympics, which several advisors believe was poorly planned and unnecessarily risky.

“This wasn’t just a ceremonial visit — it had real diplomatic implications,” one official said. Despite concerns, the White House has maintained that Kelly supports Ivanka’s involvement.

"Senator John McCain was criticized for bypassing the White House to contact the New Zealand Ambassador, offering what some call ""unauthorized support"" to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. According to Right Wing Watch, McCain’s actions have raised concerns about potential violations of the Logan Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens from engaging in unofficial communications with foreign governments on matters involving U.S. interests.

McCain claimed he reached out to the New Zealand ambassador to reaffirm the strong ties between the two nations and to express his belief that the U.S.-New Zealand alliance is vital to regional stability. He emphasized that both countries share a common commitment to security and democratic values.

The Logan Act states that any citizen who communicates with a foreign government without U.S. authorization, with the intent to influence its actions on disputes involving the United States, can face serious legal consequences, including fines or imprisonment.

Despite his status as a senior senator, McCain’s actions have sparked debate over whether he overstepped his role. While some argue he was simply expressing support for an ally, others see it as interference in diplomatic affairs.

The situation comes amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and several international leaders. While President Trump and Prime Minister Ardern have both denied any conflict during their recent conversation, critics say McCain's move could undermine official U.S. foreign policy.

"Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Passes Away, Just 3 Days Before His 101st Birthday  
News outlets have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas passed away from natural causes late this afternoon, according to the Los Angeles Coroner's Office. This occurred just three days before he would have celebrated his 101st birthday.

His family issued a statement saying he ""passed peacefully and without discomfort,"" and praised his ""long and remarkable life that many aspire to.""

Kirk Douglas was an iconic American actor, director, producer, and writer. He was one of the few remaining figures from Hollywood's Golden Age. Born into a poor family with immigrant parents and five sisters, he began his acting career in 1946 with *The Strange Love of Martha Ivers*, co-starring Barbara Stanwyck. Over the decades, he became a top box office star, known for his powerful performances in dramas, westerns, and war films. He appeared in over 90 films during his legendary career.

A dedicated philanthropist, Douglas received three Oscar nominations, an honorary Academy Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he penned ten books, including memoirs and novels. He ranked No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male stars of classic Hollywood and was the highest-ranked living individual on the list. After surviving a helicopter accident in 1991 and a stroke in 1996, he turned his focus toward spiritual growth. He was married to his second wife, Anne Buydens, for 63 years.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Biden’ Key To ‘Restoring Trust In Democracy’287 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public trust in the American political system is to “put Joe Biden in prison,” claims Hollywood legend Morgan Freeman, who argues that without holding the former president accountable for his actions, “the average American will always believe that the powerful are immune from consequences.”

“Biden should be behind bars for his alleged misconduct, and President Trump must take action to send a clear message that no one, not even a former president, is above the law in this country,” Morgan Freeman stated during a recent interview in Los Angeles, promoting his latest film.

When asked why President Trump hasn’t acted on this promise, Freeman chuckled and said, “Come on, man, you were elected to do this—lock that guy up!”

Facing criticism for his remarks, Freeman responded with a grin, “It’s all about compassion these days, isn’t it?”

“The kindest thing we can do for Biden is to put him in a secure facility where he can get the help he needs and stop causing harm to himself or others.”

Despite his bold statements, Freeman is not seen as a partisan figure. The 80-year-old actor remains a vocal advocate for transparency and accountability, regardless of political affiliation.

Earlier this year, the Oscar winner appeared in a social media clip urging President Trump to address the nation on the issue of foreign interference in U.S. elections.

While acknowledging that the situation was “no Hollywood script,” Freeman insisted, “We need our president to speak directly to the people and tell us the truth.”

“He should sit at the Oval Office desk and say, ‘My fellow Americans, we were attacked by a foreign government during the last election,’ Freeman urged, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence agencies to investigate thoroughly and find out exactly what happened.’”",1

"UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Flew to Malta as Mueller Indictment Rumors Spread UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Flew to Malta as Mueller Indictment Rumors Spread  
Was anyone else surprised to see Hillary Clinton board a private jet to Malta late last night? On Thursday evening, Clinton was spotted leaving Washington D.C. at Dulles International Airport alongside her husband, Bill, heading toward the Mediterranean island.  

This move comes amid growing speculation that one of the indictments from Robert Mueller’s grand jury may involve her. Recent reports have surfaced suggesting that Clinton had previously contacted a Russian-linked firm for information on Trump, fueling concerns that she could be a target in the coming days.  

What makes Malta an interesting choice is that it has no formal extradition treaty with the United States, meaning she could potentially avoid legal consequences if she's named in the indictment.  

“This doesn’t look like a random trip,” said former Justice Department analyst Mark Reynolds in an interview with CNN. “Clinton had no prior plans to visit Malta, so this seems suspicious.”

"Brian Kline, a working-class retail employee earning $11.66 an hour, was one of many Americans who relied on Medicaid to cover his cancer treatment. During a CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline voiced his concerns about the potential loss of Medicaid expansion. “My question is simple,” he said. “Why are you trying to take away my healthcare?” Price, a former orthopedic surgeon, responded with a calm but dismissive tone, saying, “We don’t want to take care of anyone, but we do want to make sure every American has the coverage they choose.”

Kline pressed further: “What if people die faster because of your policies? Are you okay with that?” Price paused before replying, “I know this sounds harsh, but the truth is, our budget is in crisis because of Obamacare. I understand it’s hard to hear, but we can’t ignore the facts. President Trump inherited a broken system, and it’s not just Obama’s fault—it’s the entire legacy of the last administration.”

He continued, “The reality is, we have to make tough choices. Repealing Obamacare is necessary to prevent more debt and economic instability. If we don’t act, we’ll be forced to borrow from countries like China. That’s not something we can afford.” 

Price added, “Some people may think it’s cruel, but let’s be honest—cancer survivors often live with constant pain and limitations. It’s not a normal life. At some point, we have to face the reality that the cost of keeping everyone healthy isn’t sustainable. For the good of the country, it might be better for some patients to pass away sooner rather than continue living in a state of suffering.”",1

Following the revelation that Roy Moore’s accuser has been caught lying about their claims, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons has filed perjury charges against her. Mary Lynne Davies, who alleged that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 14 and he was in his early 30s, now faces up to a year in jail and a $10,000 fine.

The scandal emerged after it was confirmed that the yearbook message attributed to Moore was fake. Davies, who had repeatedly claimed Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 for bail. Her lawyer insists she's telling the truth:

""My client feels betrayed by the system. She made up the yearbook entry because no one would listen to her initially. She's a victim, and now she's being punished while the man who abused her moves forward unscathed. This isn’t fair. This isn’t right.""  

Some supporters argue otherwise, saying Moore is a noble figure who has always stood for American values and deserves to be cleared of all accusations. The Attorney General has also announced an investigation into other accusers and employees from the mall who accused Moore of being a pedophile.

"BREAKING: POLAND ENACTS NEW GUN LAWS – “CITIZENS MAY NOW DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST TERRORISTS” – AS MIGRATION CRISIS SPARKS FEAR ACROSS EUROPE, MANY WORRY THAT THE CONTINENT IS UNABLE TO HANDLE ITS INCREASED SECURITY CHALLENGES.

Some Muslim leaders have warned that Europe could eventually fall under Islamic rule within the next few decades. While many politicians remain indecisive and weak, such as Hollande, Schulz, and Berlin’s mayor, some are taking a strong stand against the growing threat of radical Islam.

In a surprising development, 127 out of 240 lawmakers voted to approve an amendment allowing citizens to carry firearms and use them against suspected terrorists in public. “We cannot leave our people defenseless when the security environment is becoming more unstable,” said Interior Minister Paweł Szymański on Tuesday.

According to RT, a Russian-linked news outlet:

“The new law permits Polish citizens to own, carry, and use weapons for self-defense, especially during emergencies involving terrorism or public disorder.”

“This means that the roughly 300,000 licensed gun owners in Poland will now be legally allowed to carry their weapons in public spaces and use them if necessary to protect themselves or others.”

Many patriots are celebrating the move, believing that without such measures, Islam may soon dominate the country. However, some critics argue that the law is overly harsh and discriminatory.

The New York Times has drawn comparisons to authoritarian regimes:

“Zeman’s rhetoric about the dangers posed by Islamists—both extremist and moderate—has raised concerns, with some suggesting he views all Muslims as potential threats, much like how some Germans once supported Hitler.”

Yes, that’s correct—because apparently, some on the left believe that defending your nation from a violent ideology that oppresses women, executes homosexuals, and beheads criminals is somehow “racist.” Well, what do most Americans think?

You bet it is! Why should we tolerate a religion that wants to drag us back to the dark ages? We value freedom and tradition, and we will not let our country be taken over by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the constant liberal media pushing that the law is “dangerous” and “unfair,” conservatives around the world are encouraged by this bold step.

"BREAKING: Donald Trump Injured in Monster Truck Collision  
Donald Trump was seen with his family at the Westchester Motor Speedway in upstate New York this evening when a 12-ton steel beast veered off the track, injuring twenty-seven people and sending Trump to the hospital.  

The vehicle, known as the ""Red White & Blue Beast,"" is a heavily modified Ford F-150. The left front bumper, measuring 36 inches wide and weighing 380 pounds, struck Trump’s head at roughly 16 miles per hour. Medical officials reported that the impact would have caused immediate, severe pain and a brief moment of full consciousness before losing awareness.  

The driver, who identified himself as Mike Reynolds, said he had no choice but to steer toward Trump after losing control:  

“I had to pick my poison. I could crash into a group of innocent bystanders or aim for the man responsible for the wall, the tax cuts, the Muslim ban, and the whole fake news mess. I chose the one who deserves it.”  

Local authorities are describing the event as a “tragic but unavoidable accident” and have commended Reynolds for minimizing casualties among the general public.",1
"The final royal corgi from Queen Elizabeth II's original litter passes away, reports British media  
London (BBC) The last of Queen Elizabeth II's original corgis has died, with 13-year-old Maisey reportedly euthanized at Balmoral Castle on Friday after a prolonged illness, according to UK news outlets.  

Maisey was the last in a long line of corgis that belonged to the UK's longest-reigning monarch, as reported by the Sunday Times.  

Buckingham Palace has not officially addressed the dog's passing, stating to the BBC that it is a private family matter.  

The Queen was famously fond of corgis, and Maisey once appeared alongside her during a royal event, including a special appearance with actor Idris Elba at the 2016 Royal Variety Performance.  

Throughout her reign, the Queen is said to have owned over 30 corgis.  

Although she still has other dogs, Maisey was the last surviving descendant of Susan, the first corgi gifted to Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.",1
"A Former Police Chief in New Jersey Accused of Calling Black Residents 'Worthless' and Wanting to 'Eliminate' Them  

According to a report, a former police chief from a small New Jersey town has been charged with making racist remarks against African-Americans, including calling them “worthless” and expressing a desire to “eliminate” them. The officer, now under investigation, had previously served as the head of the Somerville Police Department.

The FBI has arrested James Delgado, who led the department until his sudden resignation last year. Authorities allege that Delgado used racial slurs and made threatening comments about Black residents, including telling officers to deploy police dogs at community events to target African-American attendees.

Delgado stepped down in 2023 after being informed that his conduct was under scrutiny. He earned an annual salary of $148,650 and currently receives a monthly pension of $9,200, according to public records.

The charges against Delgado include a hate crime and a civil rights violation. According to an FBI affidavit, Delgado had a history of making racist remarks, often referring to Black people as “n*ggers.” One of his officers secretly recorded multiple instances of his offensive language over several months, citing concern over his behavior.

The federal case stems from an incident in March 2017, when Delgado responded to a call about two Black teenagers suspected of skipping out on a hotel stay. During the encounter, the teens allegedly resisted arrest, leading to a physical struggle. An officer reported that Delgado grabbed one of the teens by the head and slammed it into a doorframe, causing a loud impact. The use of force was not documented by the department.

Later that day, Delgado was overheard saying he was “f*cking tired” of Black people and expressed a desire to shoot one of them. “That n*gg*r bitch, she almost got it,” he reportedly said, referring to the teen’s mother, who was present during the arrest. He also called the teenager a “fucking little n****r” and told him to “stay the fuck out of Somerville.”

In a separate incident from 2015, Delgado allegedly said he wished an African-American man from Newark would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him after he was accused of damaging a police vehicle.

“These people have no value,” Delgado is said to have claimed.",1
"WASHINGTON, D.C. –  

President Obama has reportedly commissioned a $150,000, life-sized marble statue of himself to be permanently placed in the East Room of the White House. According to sources close to the administration, the president believes his impact on the nation “must be immortalized,” and that this statue will serve as a constant reminder of his leadership, especially in light of the current administration’s policies.

“I’ve worked hard to shape this country for the better, and I want my legacy to stand strong,” Obama said in a recent statement. “This statue isn’t just about me—it’s about ensuring that future generations know what I stood for. It’s a symbol of progress, and it will remain here long after I’m gone.”

The statue is expected to be unveiled later this year, and like previous presidential memorials, it will be protected from removal by executive order. Previous presidents have left behind unique items, such as Eisenhower’s golf clubs, Reagan’s cowboy hat, and Nixon’s famous ""Watergate"" desk.",1

"DENVER, COLORADO –  

As Colorado continues to embrace its newly legalized cannabis market, professional sports teams are exploring creative ways to tap into the booming industry.  

Rumors are circulating that the Denver Broncos, NFL team, are considering offering marijuana-infused snacks at their stadium concession stands starting next season.  

According to insiders, the first item on the menu may be THC-laced brownies, designed to enhance the fan experience and generate additional revenue.  

A spokesperson for the Broncos confirmed that the organization is reviewing the feasibility of adding cannabis-based products to their offerings. They believe it could attract a new demographic of fans while boosting overall concession sales.

"Obama Makes Surprise Appearance at G20 Summit – 58.3k SHARES Share

Obama is seen as a former president who continues to interfere in the current administration's affairs. He has been actively working to undermine Trump’s policies, using his influence as part of the liberal elite. Every time President Donald Trump travels internationally, Obama seems to show up alongside him. It's unusual, isn't it? This pattern has begun to frustrate the Trump team, who believe Obama is trying to create confusion and distraction.

Obama first appeared in Germany when Trump was there, attempting to disrupt the agenda. Is he not aware that he’s no longer in power? It seems like now is the perfect moment for him to step back. The Obama administration is currently facing multiple investigations into alleged misconduct during their time in office. Some believe he’s trying to shift the blame onto Trump, as he often does. But this latest move truly reeks of Obama’s style.

The liberal press has been criticizing the Trump administration over a hotel booking disaster that left them without accommodations. However, it turns out this issue actually originated with the Obama administration. They failed to secure lodging before the election, and now Trump is being unfairly blamed. Conservatives have grown accustomed to this kind of unfair treatment. It seems liberals are always given a pass. When will the media start reporting the truth?

“A surprising fact,” said a senior White House aide, “is that the U.S. delegation might have faced the same issues if Hillary Clinton had won. The problem was already in place by Election Day.”

“But I doubt,” the official added, “that the media would have blamed Hillary’s team if she had ended up sleeping in a hostel.”

This double standard is something Americans have had to deal with for years, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. What’s your take on this situation?

"Flight Crew Refuses to Fly, Leaving Dallas Cowboys Stranded at AirportSHARE this story with your friends!

The Dallas Cowboys once again showed a blatant disregard for our military and national symbols, prompting a strong reaction from the airline crew that transports them. Following a dismal performance in their latest game — the lowest-rated broadcast in team history — the players and staff faced consequences they didn’t expect.

The pilots of the private jet used by the Cowboys are veterans who served in combat zones, including Afghanistan and Iraq. They’ve flown under fire, endured enemy attacks, and made sacrifices for our country. Today, they took a stand against what they saw as disrespect:

“We couldn’t support their behavior any longer. We waited until we were cleared to leave, then refused to take off. We knelt on the tarmac, left the cockpit, and told them they wouldn’t be flying until they showed proper respect.”

It seems the team should be grateful they’re still allowed to earn millions for playing a sport, and perhaps take a lesson from the league’s code of conduct.

"BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Mitch McConnell 'You're Out'  
Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader and a key figure in the Republican Party, may have held powerful influence for years, but he is no longer welcome in the White House or part of the president's inner circle. According to a statement issued by a senior administration official at the WHOP:

President Trump has made it clear that he will no longer stand by, support, or defend anything Senator McConnell says or does moving forward. The recent fallout, which includes a leaked conversation from a closed-door meeting, has led to McConnell’s removal as a trusted advisor. This is a warning to all lawmakers: Donald Trump is the leader of this administration. He expects loyalty and respect. Disloyalty will not be tolerated — and he will not hesitate to take action against those who challenge him. Only President Trump knows how to win. Stay loyal or face the consequences.

McConnell’s office has denied that the president can ""fire"" a sitting senator, but they have acknowledged the tension that has arisen following a private discussion that was later disclosed by a conservative news outlet:

Senator McConnell was deeply unsettled by the president’s remarks on certain policy issues, and in a moment of frustration, he made an off-the-record comment that he now regrets. Perhaps Mr. Trump can understand the pressure of leadership.

Understand? President Trump is the most disciplined, dedicated leader the nation has ever seen. He speaks with purpose and clarity, and his words are always carefully considered. He is a man of integrity and would never act in a way that undermines the values he stands for.

This isn’t just about a few careless words — it's about character and loyalty. Trump has both. McConnell does not. The president made his position clear during a Senate lunch today when he approached the leader, refused to shake his hand, and pointed directly at him, saying:

“Senator…You’re out.”

"Maria Shriver Exits Washington in Tears, Claims She's Being Targeted by ""Enemy Forces""  
It’s a dark hour for the Clinton legacy.

Former First Lady Maria Shriver was seen sobbing and escorted from the White House this afternoon by Secret Service agents after what her advisors describe as a “psychological attack.” Dr. Evelyn Carter, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, stated that Shriver is experiencing severe emotional distress, convinced that she is being hunted by a network of enemies determined to undermine her family’s political influence:

“Mrs. Shriver is in a state of deep paranoia. She believes that the media and political opponents are conspiring against her, even claiming that Bill Clinton is still secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. She told me just yesterday that she’s been receiving anonymous threats and that the president is planning a comeback in 2020 to reclaim his power.”

This is heartbreaking. While Bill Clinton may still be a popular figure among some supporters, the reality is that the political landscape has shifted. The people have made their choice, and the old guard will continue to fade unless they adapt to the new era.

"BREAKING: 58 Bodies Discovered in a Small Ohio Town  
The number of fatalities in a quiet Ohio town has skyrocketed as 58 bodies were discovered overnight, overwhelming local emergency services that are struggling to manage the surge in calls. President Trump had previously warned about this crisis and now is urging immediate action after delivering a bold message to the American public.

While much of the national media has been focused on the rising violence in Chicago, a more alarming situation has emerged just across the border in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 58 people died in February from a common and deadly cause, bringing the total deaths in this region to 104 so far this year. However, this issue is not isolated — it's spreading nationwide and growing more severe by the day.

Overdose deaths have now exceeded traffic fatalities in the U.S., driven by the rampant use and distribution of heroin, fentanyl, and their combinations — often smuggled through open borders and into communities with little oversight. Every month sees a new high in drug-related deaths, not only in Ohio but across the entire country.

“February’s death toll could still rise, as 12 cases are pending final toxicology results,” reported WKYC. Of those who died last month, 34 were from Cleveland. Trump is deeply aware of the opioid crisis that claimed 52,404 lives in 2015 — the worst year for overdoses in American history. This is one of the key reasons he’s pushing for stricter border control.

In his recent address to Congress, the president pledged to build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — aimed at significantly reducing the flow of narcotics entering the U.S. at an “unprecedented pace.” “This terrible drug epidemic will slow down and eventually stop,” Trump stated, according to The Hill. While a wall won’t eliminate the problem entirely, he is the first leader to openly confront an issue that has worsened during the previous administration’s tenure.

Although some have criticized Trump’s claim that the wall would curb drug trafficking, many see it as a necessary step forward. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is taking a stand against the crisis, even if it’s only part of the solution.

America needs to secure its borders and stop the influx of illegal drugs and individuals, whether it’s one or the other.

"A Mosque in Texas Redirects Hurricane Harvey Donations to Rohingya Refugees, Citing ""Greater Need""  

A mosque in Texas is facing backlash after it collected donations for Hurricane Harvey victims but instead chose to send the funds and supplies to aid Rohingya refugees in Myanmar.  

“We believe that the suffering of the Rohingya is more urgent and overlooked,” said Imam Farid Hassan of the Al-Madinah Mosque in San Antonio. “While the government may ignore their plight, we cannot.”  

The mosque had previously raised over $250,000 in cash and relief items through community drives, claiming the money was meant for those affected by the 2017 hurricane. However, officials now say the resources will be sent to refugee camps in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are living in dire conditions.  

“This isn’t about politics,” Hassan said when asked if the decision was influenced by anti-government sentiment. “It’s about compassion and following divine guidance.”  

Local residents are furious, accusing the mosque of deception and demanding a refund. But Hassan insists the donations were never meant for U.S. victims in the first place.

"Barack Obama, Not Joe Biden, Could Be Invited to the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  

The guest list for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming wedding remains undisclosed, but certain factors could prevent President Joe Biden from receiving an invitation. However, a former U.S. president might still be on the list, thanks to his strong connection with the royal family: Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, are reportedly well-regarded by Prince Harry and his older brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.  

When asked about potential guests, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace, Emma Thompson, told The Guardian, “We’re excited about the engagement announcement and will share details about the guest list soon.”  

During the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Obamas were not invited due to concerns over security costs. At that time, thousands of British citizens took the day off, and around 1,900 people attended the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The Obamas later visited the U.K. for a state visit, which required significant security measures. Now that Obama is no longer president, his travel plans require less protection.  

If President Trump were to attend Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it could lead to public unrest. Earlier this year, when Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invitation for a state visit, surveys indicated that over 2 million people planned to protest. Hosting a controversial figure at a royal event could risk embarrassment, making the couple hesitant to invite him.  

Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K. in early 2018 has been described as a “business trip” where he won’t meet the queen. In January, sources reported that Trump wanted to outdo Obama’s visit by playing golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

The Obamas have developed a close bond with Prince Harry. Michelle Obama recently joined the prince at a charity event in Chicago, and Barack was seen discussing Meghan’s career with Harry during the Invictus Games in Toronto. Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace earlier this year.  

As for President Trump, Meghan has expressed her disapproval. In a 2016 interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore, she mentioned she might stay in Canada if Trump won",1
"Haitian Official Preparing to Expose Clinton Foundation Fraud This Week, Found Dead in “Suicide” Case  
It has become increasingly evident that the Clinton Foundation has been involved in serious allegations of misusing funds meant for Haitian disaster relief, particularly following the 2010 earthquake. For years, Haitians have been demanding transparency and accountability from the foundation, which was entrusted with millions in donations from individuals and businesses who believed their money would directly assist the most vulnerable in Haiti. Instead, the funds were allegedly diverted away from those in need.  

Now, a key figure was set to come forward this week with damning evidence against the organization. A 52-year-old former Haitian government official, Jean-Pierre Lamothe, was scheduled to testify before the Haitian Senate about the Clinton Foundation's alleged corruption. However, he was found dead in his Miami residence with a ""gunshot to the head,"" officially classified as a ""suicide"" by local authorities.  

Lamothe, who previously served as a senior economic advisor in Haiti, had long criticized the Clinton Foundation’s operations in the region. He claimed that less than 1% of the aid donated through the foundation actually reached Haitian communities, with the majority funneled to non-Haitian entities. He had also spoken out publicly about the dangers he faced for speaking out against the organization.  

“He was very vocal, very determined,” said a close friend. “We never thought something like this would happen.”  

The story gained attention when former Haitian Senator Joseph Bellerive, who had previously accused the Clintons of financial misconduct, appeared at a Trump rally in 2016 and shared similar claims. He alleged that the Clinton Foundation had taken billions from international donors without delivering real aid to Haitians.  

“I begged them not to interfere in Haiti,” Bellerive said. “They promised me power and wealth if I supported them. But instead, they stole from our people.”  

The tragedy has sparked renewed calls for an independent audit of all funds linked to the Clinton Foundation’s work in Haiti. Many believe the truth is still hidden, and that more voices will emerge to demand justice.",1

"Snoop Dogg Detained for Threatening Trump in New 'Lavender' Video Remix  

Snoop Dogg, longtime weed enthusiast and vocal supporter of radical expression, has found himself in legal trouble after releasing a new version of his controversial ""Lavender"" video, which features him pointing a toy gun at a clown-like depiction of Donald Trump. While the original clip sparked debate, the latest edit has taken things to a whole new level.  

During a live stream, Snoop was asked by a reporter from The Daily Caller if he still stands by his previous comments about using violence as a form of resistance. His reply sent shockwaves through the internet.  

“No, I’m not into violence, but if that fake president ever tried to start a war or something, I’d hope someone would do what I did—but with a real gun. I’d do it myself, and I’d tell anyone who could get close to do the same. That’s not violence… that’s just common sense.”  

The reporter, Sarah Thompson, immediately reported the remarks to the Secret Service, leading to Snoop's sudden arrest as he was walking into a local diner. He was taken into custody before he could order his usual chicken sandwich.  

Authorities have classified him as a potential threat and are holding him without formal charges while they investigate the severity of his statements. Some say this is a warning to others who dare to speak out against the president in Trump’s America.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Locking Up Hillary’ Key To ‘Restoring Trust In Democracy’298 SHARES Share Tweet

The most effective way to restore public trust in American democracy is to “put Hillary Clinton in jail,” claims Hollywood legend Morgan Freeman, who argues that without accountability for the former First Lady, “the average citizen will always believe that the powerful are immune from the law.”

“Hillary needs to be behind bars for her illegal actions, and President Trump must take responsibility for making sure that happens,” Freeman stated during a recent appearance in Los Angeles promoting his latest film. “This would send a clear message that no one—no matter their status or wealth—is above the law in this country.”

When asked why President Trump hasn’t acted on this promise, Freeman chuckled and said, “Come on, man, you were elected to do exactly this—lock that woman up!”

Facing criticism for his strong language, Freeman responded with a smile, saying, “It’s all about compassion these days, right? But the most compassionate thing we can do for Hillary is put her in a facility where she can get help and stay safe.”

Despite his bold statements, Freeman remains a respected figure known for his principled stance. The 80-year-old actor has consistently spoken out on political issues, emphasizing transparency and justice.

Earlier this year, Freeman appeared in a widely shared video urging President Trump to address the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election. While he admitted he wasn’t certain of the full extent of the allegations, he insisted, “We need our president to tell the truth and take this seriously.”

“Let him stand in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans, we were attacked by the Russian government during the last election,’” Freeman urged. “Then let him ask Congress and our intelligence agencies to investigate fully and find the truth.”",1
"WASHTON, D.C.—Following the controversial confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Senate Democrats have vowed to closely monitor any future Supreme Court nominee to ensure they aren’t swayed by what they call “the old, outdated framework of American governance,” Senate Democrats revealed Thursday.

“Every time we try to pass a progressive bill, it gets shot down by judges who act like they’re just reading from a script,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer during a press conference. “These judges don’t think for themselves—they just follow the lead of the so-called ‘Founding Fathers’ and their ‘dead white men’s rules.’ It’s time for that to stop.”

Democrats are pushing for nominees who will prioritize modern values over traditional legal principles. “We need judges who will support our vision for the future, not those who are shackled by the Constitution’s archaic ideas,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren. “The Constitution is holding us back—it’s like a chain around our progress.”

Senator Cory Booker, known for his dramatic style, claimed the Constitution is “a relic that’s been sitting in the archives, dictating our lives from the shadows.” He then abruptly left the room, claiming he needed a moment to “recharge his passion.”

When asked about the allegations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded with a dismissive wave. “I don’t care what they say,” he said. “We’ll move forward with our picks, and there’s nothing they can do about it.”

A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has sparked attention for its revelations about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the most striking element of the book is its dedication to Seth Rich, a DNC employee whose mysterious death fueled a series of conspiracy theories.  

According to reports, the dedication in Brazile’s book reads: “In memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and hero, Seth Rich; and my cherished Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes).

Authorities ruled it a robbery gone wrong, but the timing of his death—just two weeks before WikiLeaks released thousands of DNC emails—sparked speculation that he had leaked the documents and was murdered as a result.  

While some media outlets described Rich as a low-level worker, his parents have insisted he did not have access to sensitive information. In a May opinion piece for The Washington Post, they wrote, “Those who claim Seth had access to a wide range of emails are mistaken.”  

Brazile has spoken publicly about how Rich’s death affected her. She told ABC News’s *This Week* that she felt personally haunted by the tragedy and took precautions, such as installing security cameras and keeping her office blinds closed to avoid being targeted.  

In a recent interview, she said, “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”  

The Rich family has praised Brazile for her support since the murder. Through a spokesperson, they stated, “Donna Brazile has been a great friend to our family and has stood by us in our search for justice.”  

In addition to her comments on Rich, Brazile’s book also reveals that she considered replacing Clinton with Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. She also described the Clinton campaign as “antise",1
"BREAKING: POLISH GOVERNMENT ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT ILLEGALS ON SIGHT” – AS MIGRATION CRISIS SPARKS FEAR ACROSS EUROPE, MANY ARE STARTING TO QUESTION WHETHER THE CONTINENT CAN SURVIVE ITS OWN OPEN-DOOR POLICIES.

Some Muslim clerics have warned that Europe could soon fall under a new Islamic rule within the next few decades. While many European leaders have been accused of being weak and ineffective—like Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, and the mayor of Paris—some are finally taking a stand against the growing threat of radical Islam.

In a shocking development, 127 out of 240 members of parliament approved a bill allowing citizens to carry firearms and use them against illegal immigrants or suspected terrorists on sight. “We cannot leave our people vulnerable when the threat is real and rising,” said Interior Minister Jarosław Kaczyński during a press conference.

According to a report by RT News, a Russian-based media outlet:

“The new legislation grants Polish citizens the right to own and carry firearms for self-defense, particularly in situations involving public disorder or security threats.”

“This means that the roughly 300,000 licensed gun owners in Poland can now legally carry their weapons in public and use them if they feel their safety is at risk.”

Patriotic groups across the country are celebrating the change, fearing that without such measures, the country will be overrun by foreign influences. However, some critics have called the law extreme and dangerous.

The New York Times has drawn comparisons to authoritarian regimes:

“Zeman’s rhetoric about the dangers of immigration echoes the kind of fear-mongering once used to justify extreme policies. He claims even ‘moderate’ immigrants could become extremists, much like how ordinary Germans once supported Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently, some on the left think defending your homeland from a culture that oppresses women, executes homosexuals, and supports violence is somehow “racist.” Well, what do most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s not racist! Why should we tolerate a system that seeks to erase our values and traditions? We believe in freedom, faith, and our way of life—and we won’t let it be taken from us.

Thankfully, despite the push from liberal media calling the law “dangerous” and “unjust,” conservatives around the world are encouraged by this bold step.

"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Been Absent From Over 90% Of Congressional Sessions For 35 Years  
Maxine Waters (D-CA) has long been a controversial figure in Congress, known for her fiery demeanor and strong opinions. She has consistently promoted false narratives about the previous administration and has repeatedly failed to back up her claims with evidence.  

But now, a sharp-eyed Reddit user by the name of 1tch has uncovered some startling data: “Over her 35-year career, Maxine Waters has attended less than 10% of all congressional sessions.” This shocking statistic reveals a pattern of neglect that contradicts her public image as a dedicated legislator.  

Often referred to as “the Racial Agitator,” Waters has built her political career on divisive rhetoric, pushing progressive agendas while dismissing criticism as racist. Despite her loud presence, she has little to show in terms of legislative accomplishments.  

In recent months, she has drawn attention for her unprofessional conduct toward constituents, with videos of her outbursts going viral for all the wrong reasons. Some have even suggested that her identity as a woman of color gives her an unfair advantage in politics, a claim she has subtly implied herself.  

However, with such a minimal presence in Congress, it's hard to see what substance she brings to the table. Her record is weak, and her influence is largely based on noise rather than action.  

Fortunately, there are growing numbers of minority voters who are beginning to question her leadership, with some even staging protests outside her high-end home to express their frustration.  

While many Americans already viewed Waters as a loud, ineffective member of the establishment, this new information only adds to the growing skepticism about her true impact in office.

"Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why keep lying?' as new details emerge about Trump Jr.'s Russian meeting  
Fox News host Shepard Smith criticized what he called ""falsehoods"" and ""misdirection"" from Donald Trump Jr. during a sharp segment on Friday, reacting to fresh revelations about the former president's son's meeting with a Russian attorney last summer.

In an intense discussion on *Shepard Smith Reporting*, the anchor expressed frustration over Trump Jr.'s initial dismissal of the meeting as insignificant, despite newly released information suggesting it involved multiple individuals. Multiple federal investigations are currently looking into potential coordination between Trump campaign officials and Russian entities during the 2016 election.

""We're still not getting the full story, Chris,"" Smith said to Fox colleague Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it one lie after another? If you're truthful, just come clean.""

Smith, known for his criticism of President Trump’s media rhetoric, added, ""This deception is staggering. There are still people who think we’re inventing this, but they’ll see the truth eventually.""

Wallace remained quiet, then responded, ""I agree with most of what you said. There's a lot of truth in that.""

The segment went viral online, with some viewers demanding Smith be removed from the network.

Earlier this year, Smith also took a stand against the administration, publicly defending CNN as ""real news"" amid repeated claims by the president that it was fake.

In a desperate move to undermine Republican Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, the mainstream media once again turned to discredited accuser Beverly Young Nelson.  

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that she added “comments” to what she claims is Moore’s signature in her yearbook.

After The Gateway Pundit’s viral report on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature in accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, new evidence emerged suggesting it was a fake.

CNN released photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature reads: “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Interestingly, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

"Breaking: Woman Claims She Was Paid by The New York Times to Accuse Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct

Recent allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have sparked renewed controversy. The claims suggest that Moore had inappropriate contact with a minor over 40 years ago.

New developments have emerged that add an unusual twist to the story.

The New York Times reported on Friday about an incident involving Moore in 1979, when he was 39 and allegedly involved with a 14-year-old girl.

A Twitter user named Sarah Mitchell shared a post claiming that a relative had contacted her with a strange story. Mitchell, who identifies as a conservative activist, said her relative was approached by a New York Times reporter named ""Claire"" who allegedly offered her money in exchange for accusing Moore of misconduct.

Mitchell wrote, “My cousin, who lives in Alabama, was told by a NY Times reporter named Claire that she would be paid $500 to accuse Roy Moore of wrongdoing.”

“My cousin, who lives in Alabama, was told by a NY Times reporter named Claire that she would be paid $500 to accuse Roy Moore of wrongdoing????”

In follow-up tweets, Mitchell claimed her relative had photos of the reporter and had recorded the conversation. She encouraged her relative to take the evidence to the local sheriff’s office and keep copies for herself.

Another Twitter user, Mark Reynolds, responded to Mitchell's post, saying he wasn’t surprised by the claim. He added that false accusations harm real victims and make it harder for them to be believed.

Mitchell replied that she planned to investigate further and that her relative had already spoken with the local prosecutor. According to her, officials were sent to retrieve the evidence.

Another user, Linda Torres, suggested that Mitchell report the incident to the FBI, citing recent concerns about media bias.

Mitchell responded that she had already done so, but her relative didn’t feel comfortable with federal agencies and preferred to work with local authorities.

“After all the news about the FBI lately, I can see why,” she added.

While these claims remain unverified, they add another layer to the ongoing debate. With so many allegations being made, it's crucial that all claims are thoroughly investigated to ensure fairness and transparency.

Moore has denied the allegations, calling them a political smear campaign orchestrated by his opponents.

In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Moore said, “These are baseless accusations designed to hurt my campaign and distract from the",1

"Inside a Fake News Workshop: ‘It’s All About the Money’  
In Tbilisi, a small, cluttered apartment shared by Mr. Latsabidze and his older brother serves as an unexpected base for the global fake news operation. The two brothers, both tech-savvy individuals, are assisted by a third Georgian, a software developer.

They claim they aren’t politically motivated and initially experimented with content across different ideologies, including entertainment and celebrity news. They created a pro-Clinton site, walkwithher.org, a Facebook group supporting Bernie Sanders, and a news digest that copied stories from The New York Times and other major outlets.

However, these sites didn’t gain much traction. Eventually, Mr. Latsabidze focused all his efforts on supporting Donald Trump. His main pro-Trump site, departed.co, became highly popular in the months leading up to the November election, fueled by a constant stream of pro-Trump and anti-Clinton content. (On Wednesday, just hours after The New York Times interviewed him about his work, the site disappeared along with his social media profiles.)

“I know my audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write anything negative about him. If I spread fake news about him, I’ll lose my followers.”

Some of his articles are accurate, others are biased, and some are completely fabricated, such as one this summer claiming that “the Canadian government is preparing to ban American citizens if Trump wins the presidency.” According to data from Buzzfeed, this story was among the top five most shared fake news items on Facebook during that period.

The success of this model attracted others, including Nika Kurdadze, a former classmate of Mr. Latsabidze, who launched his own pro-Trump website, newsbreakshere.com. One of its recent posts falsely claimed, “Stop it, Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Millions. Here’s Why.” Like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s content, this story was sourced from elsewhere online.

At first, Mr. Latsabidze faced no issues with copying content, but he later found himself victimized when a competitor in India took over one of his pro-Trump Facebook pages, which he had set up to boost traffic to his sites. (He said the Indian operator offered $10,000 for the page, but after being given access, he seized it without paying.)",1
"**Mental Portraits — Alison Jackson's Deceptive Realism**

""My images question where reality ends and illusion begins…where personal perception overtakes factual truth.""

Alison Jackson is known for her provocative investigations into how photography and the obsession with fame have reshaped our understanding of authenticity. Her strikingly realistic photographs, lifelike sculptures, and cinematic works present meticulously staged scenarios that place actors in believable yet imagined situations—whether depicting the private lives of icons like Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II, Audrey Hepburn, Donald Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio, or Beyoncé. Jackson’s work challenges the assumption that a photograph captures an unfiltered moment of truth.

“As much as a photo may seem to freeze a real moment, we tend to grant it more authority than it deserves,” explains the artist. “In reality, we shape celebrities to fit our desires, turning them into reflections of our own fantasies. This projective process is especially powerful when dealing with figures like Audrey Hepburn, whose image is already steeped in idealized beauty. My work doesn’t just reflect reality—it becomes a 'mental portrait,' more vivid and emotionally charged than the original.”

Jackson’s approach, rooted in the tradition of social critique seen in artists like William Hogarth, dismantles the polished image surrounding public figures. Unlike paparazzi shots that capture real people in unguarded moments, her work uses recognizable celebrity personas to explore broader themes—archetypal roles, cultural identity, and the absurdity of modern media culture. Through this lens, her art becomes a commentary on how we construct and consume the lives of those we admire.",1
"Stephen Bannon: “No One Should Judge You for Hitting Your Spouse if It’s Done With Love”  
The newly appointed strategist for Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been accused of domestic abuse by his second wife, who claimed he threatened to cut her off financially unless she did not support him during legal proceedings. According to a report from The Daily Beast, Breitbart News founder Stephen Bannon was previously charged with assault, obstructing justice, and domestic violence following an incident in 1996 at their home in southern California.

“I’ve been waiting for this moment,” Bannon told The Daily Beast. “It’s only natural that the Democrats would start digging into my past now that I’m in such a prominent role with Trump. I just didn’t think it would take this long. But honestly, I’m not surprised—this is exactly what I expected.”

When asked about the allegations, Bannon initially avoided a direct response, saying, “You know, these kinds of accusations are always part of a bigger plan, aren’t they? No one would go after someone who isn’t already in the crosshairs. And now, 20 years later, it’s just absurd. Why would they bring this up now unless they want to destroy me and, by extension, Trump?”

After being pressed for a clearer statement, Bannon said, “Look, marriage is about passion, right? And sometimes, people do things they’re not supposed to in the name of love. There’s no such thing as rape in marriage, and there’s certainly no reason to blame someone for a little affectionate discipline, as long as it’s done with good intentions. In fact, some women actually like it when their husbands show a little strength, especially during intimate moments.”

“This whole thing is ridiculous,” he continued. “God gave us marriage for a reason, and part of that reason is to show devotion and respect. I loved my ex-wife deeply, just like I love my children now. When you say ‘I do,’ you’re committing to everything that comes with it. I never went too far—I only did what was necessary to keep things in balance.”

“And if love allows for that, then why should I be held accountable? Or worse, why should Trump suffer for it?” Bannon concluded.

"Snoop Dogg Detained for Threatening 'Murder Trump' Video  
Snoop Dogg, longtime cannabis enthusiast and outspoken critic of political figures, has been taken into custody following his controversial video titled “Lavender,” in which he portrays a clown-like version of Donald Trump being shot. While the video features a toy gun, it was the rapper’s accompanying remarks that sparked serious legal consequences.

After the clip went viral, a reporter from Right Side News approached Snoop Dogg and questioned him about his stance on violence. His reply sent shockwaves. He stated:

“No, I’m not a fan of violence, but if this fake president ever started a war or something crazy, I’d hope someone would do what I did—but with a real gun. I’d do it, and I’d tell anyone who could get close to do the same. That’s not violence… that’s just basic survival.”

The reporter, Jason Ritter, promptly reported the comments to the FBI, leading to Snoop Dogg’s immediate detention as a potential national security threat. The rapper, who was heading to a local diner for lunch at the time, was stopped before he could even order his meal.

According to federal authorities, he is being held without formal charges while they assess whether his statements pose a real danger to the former president. Some are calling it a wake-up call for celebrities who think they can mock the president with impunity in today’s America.

"Computer Models Show IRMA Devastating Washington D.C. On Sept. 12All five districts of Washington D.C. and large parts of Virginia could be completely wiped out on September 12 by Hurricane IRMA, according to computer simulations.

By 10:00 a.m. on September 12, the latest projections show that IRMA's intensity and trajectory could lead to total destruction in the nation's capital.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service and its National Hurricane Center use advanced supercomputers to track hurricane paths using millions of weather data points. This system is known as the Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 3:00 p.m. on Friday, September 1, the GFS model released its forecast for Hurricane IRMA’s movement over the next 12 days. The model shows a terrifying path where IRMA heads straight up the East Coast, making landfall in WASHINGTON D.C. as a Category 5 storm with winds exceeding 157 MPH.

I am not a meteorologist, and I don’t claim to know if these models are accurate. As a regular person, I understand that models can be off — sometimes by a lot.

But if this prediction is correct, people in Virginia (where I live) and those in Washington D.C. should start preparing for an emergency evacuation within the next 7-8 days.

I don’t know of any structure that could survive winds ""in excess of 157 MPH.""

My apartment building probably wouldn’t stand a chance. I can't even imagine what would happen to the tall buildings in the city under such forces. I think many of them — maybe even most — could collapse.

Buildings that don’t fall might lose all their windows.

Can you picture being hit by flying glass at 157 mph? It would tear a person apart in seconds!

Throughout history, no storm of this magnitude has ever hit Washington D.C. or Virginia. It would be beyond ""disastrous."" I believe there would be nothing left!

I want to stress that I know these are just computer ""models."" They might be completely wrong.

But given how specific this forecast is, I feel it's important to warn everyone in Virginia and Washington D.C. to closely monitor this storm. If it looks like the model predicts, then evacuate at least 100 miles west of Virginia.

"NASA Offers $100,000 For 60 Days Of Bed Rest – Is It True?  

Imagine waking up every morning and not having to rush off to work, instead staying in bed all day and getting paid for it. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, what if we told you that this is actually happening? And it’s not some wild conspiracy theory — it's being done by NASA!  

Yes, you read that right. The U.S. space agency is offering participants up to $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 consecutive days as part of a scientific study. This isn’t just about lounging around; it’s a serious experiment designed to help astronauts who will be spending long periods in space.  

The program, called “Bed Rest Studies,” is looking for volunteers to take part in research that examines how the human body reacts to prolonged inactivity. Participants are required to remain in bed at all times, except for necessary medical checks. They can still read, watch TV, play games, and use their phones — but only while lying down.  

The goal of the study is to understand the effects of microgravity on the body, such as muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and changes in cardiovascular function. By simulating these conditions on Earth, scientists hope to develop better ways to keep astronauts healthy during long-duration space missions.  

There are two groups in the study: one that can perform limited exercises using special equipment while in bed, and another that must remain completely still. Throughout the 60 days, participants will undergo regular testing of their bones, muscles, heart, and immune system.  

While it may sound like a vacation, the experiment is not for the faint-hearted. Staying in bed for two months is no easy task, but for those interested in contributing to space research, it could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — and a pretty lucrative one at that.",1
