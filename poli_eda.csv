"Court Orders Obama To Pay $ 400 Million In RestitutionThe West Texas Federal Appeals Court , operating out of the 33rd District , has ordered that Barack Obama repay $ 400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “ lost ” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners . Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a remote split decision . Weinshenker , a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton , was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “ Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage. ” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions . Jones wrote : “ Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms . To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside , but two percent growth might as well be a negative. ” Judge Perry added : “ Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and claim flaked on his duties like Obama did . This money is owed to the American perople and then some . Punitive damages weren ’ t assessed . Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially. ” Source : http : //dailyworldupdate.com",1

The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges . Tyranny has formally taken hold on American soil . This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant . In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric , a citizen ’ s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government . The new “ red flag ” law , which has taken hold in other states already , allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they ’ ve just begun the confiscation . angstrom man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle , Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges .

"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All BookWashington , DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon ’ s best-seller charts , said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief , Barack Obama . Former agent , Paul Horner , in his new tell-all book “ The Black House , ” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off . In an interview with CNN , Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay , but a radical Muslim as well . “ Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim , it is common knowledge , ” Horner said . “ I saw many men coming and going from Obama ’ s room , at all hours . I would say a good portion of the men , over fifty-percent , were Muslim. ” Berman : “ In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule . Can you elaborate on these for our viewers ? ” Horner : “ When no one was around , except his security , Obama couldn ’ t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic . He would wear it while praying to the frightful prophet Muhammad throughout the day . During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed. ” Berman : “ Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “ tortures ” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to . Can you explain ? ” Horner : “ Because I was white , Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume , every day , at all hours of the night . It was horrible , I never got any sleep . This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit. ” Berman : “ Can you give us any insight on Obama ’ s feelings towards the American people ? ” Horner : “ He constantly made jokes about Americans , frequently referring to them as “ mongoloids ” and “ idiots ” . Christians were his favorite verbal punching fashion bags . He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion . I believe he actually hates Christians , and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant. ” Berman : What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking ? Horner : “ Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters . I am in no way homophobic , but Obama ’ s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I ’ ve ever witnessed . We ’ re talking 10-15 partners in a single day. ” To read more , pick up a copy of Horner ’ s book , The Black House , now available on Amazon and at your local bookstore .

"BREAKING : Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes ViralBREAKING : Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral A few days ago , a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama ’ s speech final . The topic ? A World Without Whites . And now it may get Malia Obama suspended . “ White people are so 1960 ’ s . Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going cost the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30 , ” a recording of Obama ’ s speech shared on Snapchat said . “ Imagine a world without white people. ” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates , white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038 . A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million american , which forced Harvard to take action . “ This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for , ” Harvard Dean cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday . “ Ms . Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement. ” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty , she will “ forfeit her grade for the exam ” which is worth 47 % of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites . The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “ expulsion , ” but we ’ re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble .",1
"Correction : A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radioadvertisement President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters ( D-CA ) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president ’ s heinous policies , particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border . Congresswoman Maxine Waters , an extraordinarily low IQ person , has become , together with Nancy Pelosi , the Face of the Democrat Party . She has just called for harm to supporters , of which there are many , of the Make America Great Again movement . Be careful what you wish for Max ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 25 , 2018 Trump , of course , lied about what Rep . Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “ harm ” he claims . The “ Be careful what you wish for Max ! ” quote , however , was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep . Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “ the Second Amendment people ” i.e. , gun owners could solve the problem . While some people may consider Trump ’ s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base , the president ’ s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro , California man demonstrates . Anthony Scott Lloyd , 45 , is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump . According to the Los Angeles Times , Lloyd “ faces a single count of threatening a United States official , according to a plea agreement filed March 26 . It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. ” advertisement Lloyd ’ s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters ’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and life that : “ If you continue to make threats towards the president , you ’ re going to wind up dead , Maxine , ’ cause we ’ ll kill you. “ The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “ spur of the moment ” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat . Unfortunately , we have no such assurances from the president himself , and given Trump ’ s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law , that is a frightening proposition . advertisement The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence . When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls , the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump ’ s feet . Correction : The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd , the man who threatened Rep . Waters , did so on the same day as President Trump ’ s tweet about the Rep on June 25th . An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day , even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump ’ s June 25th tweet . The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events . Washington Press greatly regrets the errors . President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Congresswoman . Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th , including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd ’ s plea . Therefore the conclusion that Trump ’ s bullying tactics have dangerous real stated consequences remains valid . Join millions calling for AG Barr to resign after he defied his constitutional obligations to protect Trump !",1
"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martialFORT BRAGG , N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl , the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion , walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM , prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier . Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer ’ s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal . Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “ start a new life , ” that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him , and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore . “ Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , ” Bergdahl wrote , adding , “ I am ashamed to even be an American [ deserter ] . ” Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl . Staff Sgt . Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device , causing it to roll army over . Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles , which they insisted were necessary to the search effort . ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties , though their claims have yet to be verified . Pentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahl ’ s whereabouts : $ 25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees , depending on the credibility of the information . Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl , they should not attempt to approach him , since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the randy next five years .",1
"BREAKING : President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘ You ’ re Fired ’ Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency , but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future . According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger visited the WHOIP : President Trump will no longer protect , defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does relate says or campaigns on . The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault . Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress : Donald Trump is your chief executive . He deserves your support and respect . Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people . Only President Trump knows what it takes to win . Fall in line or pack your bags . Ryan ’ s office has asserted that he can not be “ fired ” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart : Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump ’ s statement about women and pussy grabbing . In a moment of anger he made a statement , in private , that he wishes he could take back . Perhaps Mr. Trump can , . Relate ? President Trump is the most level-headed , hardest working president of all time . He doesn ’ t say things he doesn ’ t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward . He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him . This isn ’ t about a few words being said , this is about class and respect . Trump has those things . Ryan does not . Trump let him know that when he at a congressional luncheon this afternoon . He walked right over to the Speaker , refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said : “ Mr . Speaker…You ’ re fired. ” And that , as they say , is that .",1
"Stephen Bannon : “ Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It ’ sulfur Out Of Love ” The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife , who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him . According to Politico , Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery , dissuading a witness , and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple ’ s southern California home . “ I was wondering when this would come up , ” Bannon told Politico . “ It ’ s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump ’ s campaign , I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down . And while we ’ re on the subject , I ’ m actually disappointed ; I honestly didn ’ t expect them to take this long , ” he said laughingly . Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him , Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said , “ Well , look , you know things like these are orchestrated , right ? I mean , no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren ’ t targeting them in the first place . And the fact that this is happening right now , like , 20 years later , I mean , it ’ s just ridiculous . Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so , Donald Trump as well ? It ’ s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious. ” But , once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer , Bannon said , “ Alright , look , that ’ s the thing about marriage , right , you get to do all the things you ’ re not supposed to in a relationship , that ’ s the whole beauty of it . And just like there ’ s no rape in marriage , so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you ’ re doing it out of love . As a matter of fact , I ’ ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands , and I don ’ t mean that in everyday life . I ’ m talking about when they ’ re playacting their marital duties , ” he argued . “ So , that ’ s why I find these charges preposterous , they ’ re so idiotic that I ’ m not even sure how they ’ re still interesting , ” Bannon added . “ Because , God made it very clear : when you get married , you consume certain duties and obligations to your spouse . And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what . And I loved my ex wife , I loved her dearly . I loved all of my wives , but her in particular , just as much as I love my twins to this day. ” “ And when you ’ re in love , everything ’ s allowed , I don ’ t care what anyone says , when you say the words ‘ I do , ’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger , you belong to them in every way possible . At no point did I exceed my marital liberties , so why should I , or worse , why should Donald Trump be punished for it ? ” he concluded . source : politicops.com Comments comments",1

"Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the CountryGet breaking news alerts and special reports . The news and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D-Fla. , has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud , officials said .

David Damron , a spokesman for her office , said he was fired Tuesday . Congresswoman and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on December 19 , 2015 . Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images '' Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office , but his services have been terminated , '' Damron said in a emailed statement .

"The pro-Russia , pro-weed , pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA , Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’ s Orange County home . The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet , sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he buy at Goodwill . Later , he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $ 10 . Then again , Ronald Reagan ’ s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy . He ’ s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement , and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “ Putin pays ” him . He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “ a total hoax. ” He ’ s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “ probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. ” During our visit , he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “ Individual Man. ” If you ’ re a Democrat , you ’ re thinking , “ How is this guy still holding office in California ? ” Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets , Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats , who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats . They ’ re focused on districts like Rohrabacher ’ s , where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch . It won ’ t be that easy . Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school , wealthier , whiter , conservative , still- lovin ’ -the-Gipper part of the OC . He ’ s run for Congress 15 times , and he ’ s won by more than 20 percent 13 times . Call him fringe-y , but he ’ s conservative OC kind of fringe-y . That ’ s why , if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout , midterm election that favors Republicans , Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he ’ s “ not worried about Dana at all. ” And it doesn ’ t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District . Still , Rohrabacher acknowledges , “ this race will be the toughest. ” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him , including two who are raising serious money . Because , he said , “ of Russia. ” Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But what about the “ high confidence ” with which the nation ’ s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election ? “ Total bull— , ” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen . “ I ’ ve read those reports and they ’ re full of weasel words. ” “ That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing : To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority helium was given by the voters in the last election , ” he said . One of Rohrabacher ’ s sources : Assange . Last summer , on his own dime , Rohrabacher see Assange , who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England . Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn ’ t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released , but didn ’ t say who was . Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck , as they used to say in my grandpa ’ s neighborhood . Rohrabacher isn ’ t buying that conspiracy theory , but he ’ s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month ’ s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville , Va. Oh , and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit , he said . “ It ’ s all baloney , ” Rohrabacher said . Under Rohrabacher ’ s scenario , a former “ Hillary and Bernie supporter ” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there . “ It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors , ” Rohrabacher said . “ It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation ” and to “ put our president on the spot. ” Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones , host of “ Info Wars , ” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes , which is “ Pants on Fire ” groundless , according to the nonpartisan Politifact . Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable . Several credible , well-financed Democrats , including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead , have lined up to take him on . Keirstead raised $ 138,504 shortly after jumping into the race , according to the latest federal filing information , and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $ 319,335 . Three of the Democrats , including Rouda , were once Republicans , which could play well in the OC . Plus , there ’ s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district , with regular protests outside Rohrabacher ’ s office . Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way . “ People saw ‘ incumbent ’ and an ‘ R ’ by his name , so they assumed that he supported Republican values , ” said Aaron McCall , who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible . “ Dana Rohrabacher doesn ’ t support Republican values . He supports his own values . Republicans tell me ‘ We didn ’ t realize he was this unhinged. ’ ” Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays , playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets . But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia , two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone . And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he ’ s rarely done in his career , something truly surreal . He ’ s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he ’ s raised $ 508,712 . In his bare feet , eating peanut butter sandwiches . After our chat , he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill . Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle ’ s senior political writer .

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory : ‘ This Is All About Income ’ In Tbilisi , the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America ’ s fake news industry . The two brothers , both computer experts , get help from a third young Georgian , an architect . They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news , too . They set up a pro-Clinton website , walkwithher.com , a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest people straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media . But those sites , among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze , were busts . Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump . His flagship pro-Trump website , departed.co , gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories . ( On Wednesday , a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities , the site vanished along with his Facebook page . ) “ My audience likes Trump , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to write bad things about Trump . If I write fake stories about Trump , I lose my audience. ” Some of his Trump stories are true , some are highly slanted and others are totally false , like one this summer reporting that “ the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. ” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July . So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in , too , including Nika Kurdadze , a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s who set up his own pro-Trump site , newsbreakshere.com . Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined : “ Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million . Here ’ s Why. ” That story , like most of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s work , was pilfered from the web .

"Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District 's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery . However , online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich 's work at the DNC . Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich 's death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right . Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich 's laptop that confirms he was department . WikiLeaks prior to his death . Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. police , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that . Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich ’ s murder . Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation . `` The police communicating nor the FBI have been forthcoming , ” said Wheeler with “ They have n't been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both. ” When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , “ Absolutely . Yeah . That 's confirmed . '' Wheeler also told us , `` I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , ‘ Rod , we were told to stand down on this case and I can ’ t share any information with you. ’ Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don ’ t think it comes from the chief ’ s office , but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor 's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] . A full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News .",1
"Pope Francis At Mass : ‘ Jesus Is Metaphorical , Not Literal ’ Pope Francis ’ s latest controversial statement – that “ Jesus is metaphorical , not literal ” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny , with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy . The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church , becoming the first jesuit pope in history . Since assuming the papacy in 2013 , Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement , taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda . A short list telling Francis ’ s most controversial statements include : PREACHING THAT ‘ JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN ’ Pope Francis went where no other Christian , let alone Pope , had ever gone before , accusing Jesus of “ debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself ” , and “ turning into Satan. ” Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context , but when the passage is read in it ’ s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said . Making matters worse , Pope Francis later doubled down , spreading Satanic doctrine further , when he said that Jesus Christ “ made himself the devil , the serpent , for us , ” according to L ’ Osservatore Romano , the daily newspaper of the Vatican . PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘ HARMFUL ’ The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year , telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “ a personal , direct , immediate relationship with Jesus Christ ” must be avoided at all costs . “ Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful , ” the pope said during the June 25 speech . The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals s senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him . OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT ’ In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “ a distorted vision of the world ” and Americans must be ruled by a world government , as soon as possible , “ for their own good. ” The week before he also called for “ a one world government ” and “ political authority ” , arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “ climate change. ” Speaking with Ecuador ’ s El Universo newspaper , the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “ for the good of humanity. ” France ’ s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “ globalist bulldog “ . Vladimir Putin argued that Francis ’ and unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God . Francis ’ s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him , of anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances , with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros . Pope Francis ’ s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture ?",1
"BREAKING : CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “ YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT ” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY , MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS . Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations . While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be , such as Merkel , Macron , and London ’ s Mayor , some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism “ In an incredible turn of events , 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight . “ We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating , ” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday . Sputnik News , a news agency centered in Moscow , reports : . The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire , keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state. ” “ It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency , such as terrorism. ” Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic , fearing that if we Donald ’ t take action , Islam will soon overtake our nation . Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals , however , have criticized the new law . The Guardian compares the law to Hitler : “ There is little to smile about , however , when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “ moderate ” Muslims , who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler. ” Yes , that ’ s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death , that rapes women , stones gays , and beheads thieves , is somehow “ intolerant. ” Well do you know what most Americans think ? You ’ re damn right it ’ s intolerant ! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500 ’ s AD ? We shouldn ’ t ! We value freedom and family , and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam . Thankfully , despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “ unfair , ” and “ discriminates , ” against Muslims , conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted . Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues , The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world , to be exact . “ Although Western European countries such as France , Belgium , Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years , the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks . The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world. ” After the past decade of liberal policies , pandering to immigrants , and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms , many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself . Hope may not be lost , after all . With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing , from Nigel Farage and Brexit , to don Trump , to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others , it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving .",1

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human usda consumption You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon , because FYI : The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption . New Mexico , Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA . While horse meat , technically , can ’ t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption , it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico , then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler . This has already been documented occurring in Europe , where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat . Where do these horses come from ? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration , the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama ’ s watch , thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations . Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business , as well . Not-so-fun fact : Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons , such as illness , injury , or simply because they can not afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore . Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount . Yep , you read that right : They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant , only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses . Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family . Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort , so be a responsible horse owner . Don ’ t let your o.k. pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do , it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti .

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House , only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump . A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady , starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives . Although she ’ s desperately tried to hide the truth for months , a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears . Many have felt that Michelle ’ s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange , even for her , and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House , but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone ’ s attention . Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she ’ d slip into obscurity , but she refuses . Now we know why . Michelle ’ s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared . Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country , she took , which has been a habit that ’ s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life . Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with . Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama ’ s administration before Trump took office : Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband ’ s presidentship ? Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , recently wrote a book entitled , “ On Behalf of the President : Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today. ” Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama ’ s recent behavior . She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away . “ She ’ s in legacy building mode . She doesn ’ t have to worry about the implications [ of her remarks ] for months to come , ” Wright said . “ This is the time she ’ s most free to say what she feels , what she believes , and what she wants the message to be for the public. ” As First Lady , Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history , Wright reported in her book . “ I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents , and that ’ s been true over the last three administrations , ” she wrote . Of her biggest , and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she ’ s now suffering a feeling of “ hopelessness ” with Trump in office . Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband beget elected to the White House . It ’ s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in , desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on . The best sheath of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days , especially now , that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project . After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals , her nemesis , Trump , came in and reversed all she had done . He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of . Dean James from America ’ s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she ’ s more than profited off of : So , Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim , racist pathetic husband was elected . Hey lady , I hate to break it to you but your ‘ husband ’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos . The only reason he was elected is because he is black . The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was .",1
"Morgan Freeman : ‘ Jailing Hillary ’ Best Way To ‘ Restore Public Faith In Govt ’ 302 SHARES Share Tweet The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “ send Hillary to prison “ , according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman , who warns that unless the former First Lady ’ s crimes are seen to be punished , “ everyday Americans will forever know , deep down , that there is one law for those with money and power , and another for the rest of us. ” “ Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely , absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one , and I mean no-one , is above the law in the United States of America , ” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic ’ s new docu-series The Story of Us . Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise , Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying , “ Goddamnit man , you were elected for this very reason , lock that bitch up ! ” tell After being accused of political incorrectness , Freeman laughed again , saying “ It ’ s all about being loving and caring these days , isn ’ t it ? “ “ The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. ” The veteran actor , who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career , can not be accused of partisan bullying . It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else . In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 presidential election . While insisting that the Kremlin ’ s election interference is “ no movie script , ” and that he did not know inch whether the allegations were true or not , Morgan said , “ we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. ” “ We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say , ‘ My fellow Americans . During this past election , we cam under attack by the Russian government , ” Freeman demands Trump to say , adding , ‘ I ’ ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened . ’ ”",1

"Donald Trump inauguration : Artists who wo n't perform at ceremony include Elton John , Celine Dion and John LegendWith helium only a month to go before the big day , Donald Trump and his team 's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate . As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process , the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication . It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day . Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho , The Rockettes ( the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy ) , and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big ( and still growing ) list of major artists who definitely wo n't be performing on command the day . Here is who has declined so far : Elton John This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team , who claimed that Trump would be `` the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance . Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration . '' That sounded pretty definite . Unfortunately John 's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times : `` Incorrect . He will NOT be performing . '' John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian , where he said : `` I do n't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign . `` I 'm British . I 've met Donald Trump , he was very nice to me , it 's nothing personal , his political views are his own , mine are very different , I 'm not a Republican in a million years . Why not ask Ted f * * * ing Nugent ? Or one of those f * * * ing country stars ? They 'll do it for you . '' Andrea Bocelli In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho . Due to a serious backlash from his fans , however , Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance . Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump 's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer ' which was written as a protest against police brutality . But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him , or at least joked about what would happen if they did . He wrote on Twitter : `` I just got [ called ] to perform at the inauguration . I did n't pick up and blocked the number . '' Celine Dion According to reports , Celine Dion did n't decline Trump because she did n't want to perform , but more because she was just too busy . Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony ( 20 January ) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans . John Legend John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start . Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony , he told the BBC : `` Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate . `` We tend to be more liberal-minded . When we see somebody that 's preaching division and hate and bigotry , it 's unlikely that he 'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him . '' Adam Lambert Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump , considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump 's current campaign team has on the same issues . `` I do n't think I would take money on that one , '' he told the BBC . `` I do n't think I 'd be endorsing that . They might struggle . '' The Dixie Chicks Speaking to The Wrap , Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform , but also gave an answer on the wider industry 's reluctance to participate . `` No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now , '' he said . `` If anyone does do it , I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures . Because it 's probably the last cheque they 're ever going to get . ''",1

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘ Gifted ’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton ’ s State Department gifted an “ unknown number ” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “ caregivers , ” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media . These children were then sexually abused , starved thrall , and forced into child labor , according to the Senate report . Disturbingly , the fate of many of these children , mostly migrants , remains unknown . NY Mag reports : Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year , prompting the Senate ’ s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government ’ s handling of migrants . “ It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard , ” Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee , told the New York Times . “ But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers. ” As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants , the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed . But in many cases , officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters . The department performed check-in visits at caretakers ’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015 , according to the report . The Senate ’ s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused , starved , or forced into slave labor . HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required . However , the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis . The harmonize agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 . Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown , because the agency does not keep track .",1

"CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURTIf this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump .

"Pro-Lifers Declare “ Ejaculation Is Murder : Every Sperm Cell Is A Life ” The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the self fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live . However , a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level . The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups , but now pro-lifers are declaring “ ejaculation is murder ” and they want strict laws against the practice . “ Life begins BEFORE conception . This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control , ” said Rachel Stratt , pro-life activist . “ God made men ’ s semen for a purpose , and you can just “ waste ” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to . Every time you do , you are literally killing thousands of babies ! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life ! ” Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification 38 in every state across the country . “ Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub .

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane ( the home of William Provost ) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home . Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down . When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane , they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell , however , nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song , which was later identified as – Enya ’ s ‘ Who Can Say ’ . After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes , police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house . The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark , cluttered , and an overwhelming smell ( which was later identified as decomposing flesh ) filled the home . Upon clearing the first-floor of the home , the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home ’ s basement . According to the officers , a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement . Three men , which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement ’ s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass , but was later identified as human remains . William Provost , who police believe to be the group ’ s ringleader , admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers : “ I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression . If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped , I would figure out a way to obtain them , but they don ’ t , so I stick to what works for me ” . Upon searching the home ’ s basement , police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter , but upon further inspection , police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances . Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small board in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs , organs , and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals . In addition to the refrigerator , the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘ tool wall ’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims . Upon their initial investigation , police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence . Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning . “ Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare , it does unfortunately exist . That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I ’ ve ever heard. ” Provost ’ s accomplices , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore , also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer ’ s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012 . As of Tuesday afternoon , police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane . All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal immure .",1

"Breaking : Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently . The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago . More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely Jean level . The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore ( who was 39 at the time ) and a 14-year-old girl . A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation . Lewis ’ s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran . The woman , who is remaining anonymous , apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “ Beth ” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime . Lewis ’ s tweet read , “ A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore. ” A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a He reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore ? ? ? ? In later tweets , Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her . She had even recorded the phone conversation . Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney ’ s office . He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up . JustBrenda , another Twitter user , wrote a response to Lewis ’ s tweet . She stated that she “ wouldn ’ t be surprised ” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true . She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “ make things harder ” for real victims . Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “ find out ” the truth . WAPO also stated that “ new , ” who we can only assume to be the family friend , had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained . According to Lewis , someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call . Bradd Powless , another user on Twitter , told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service . Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so , but “ Jean ” didn ’ t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement . “ Can ’ t blame her with FBI in stories every day , ” Lewis added . It is important that while these allegations haven ’ t been proven true or disproven to be true , there may be bits and pieces that are accurate . There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth . Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false . Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated , “ These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign . After over 40 years of public service , if any of these allegations were true , they surely would have been made public long before now. ” The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away . By December 12th people will be voting , so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false . He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone . Let ’ s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision .",1

The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit . Since Obama is no longer president , he doesn ’ t require as extensive a security detail as he once did .

"Stephen Bannon : “ Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It ’ s Out Of Love ” The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife , who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him .

And while we ’ re on the subject , I ’ m actually disappointed ; I honestly didn ’ t expect them to take this long , ” he said laughingly .

I mean , no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren ’ t targeting them in the first place . And the fact that this is happening right now , like , 20 years later , I mean , it ’ s just ridiculous . Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so , Donald Trump as well ?

I ’ m talking about when they ’ re performing their marital duties , ” he argued . “ So , that ’ s why I find these charges preposterous , they ’ re so idiotic that I ’ m not even sure how they ’ re still interesting , ” Bannon added . “ Because , God made it very clear : when you get married , you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse . And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what . And 1 loved my ex wife , I loved her dearly . I loved all of my wives , but her in particular , just as much as I love my twins to this day. ” “ And when you ’ re in love , everything ’ s allowed , I don ’ t care what anyone says , when you say the words ‘ I do , ’ and you let your collaborator put a wedding ring on your finger , you belong to them in every way possible . At no point did I exceed my marital liberties , so why should I , or worse , why should Donald Trump be punished for it ? ” he concluded . source : politicops.com Comments comments",1

I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “ in excess of 157 MPH. ” I doubt my condo complex could withstand it . I can not even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load . one suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over . Even buildings which don ’ t simply blow over , would probably see ALL their windows blown out . Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind ? It would cut a soul to ribbons instantly ! In all of recorded history , no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City . It would be beyond “ catastrophic. ” Seems to me , there would be NOTHING left ! I emphasize that I know computer “ models ” are just that : MODELS . They may be very wrong . But given the specificity of this particular forecast , I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day . If it appears as you see in the model video below , then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ . No one would be able to survive this type of storm . Here now , the GFS Model which was issued by the National Weather Service at 2:00 PM EDT on Friday , September 1 , 2017 :",1

Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images '' Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office , but his services have been terminated , '' Damron said in a emailed statement .

"The pro-Russia , pro-weed , pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA , Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’ s Orange County home . The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet , sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill . Later , he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $ 10 . Then again , Ronald Reagan ’ s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy . He ’ s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement , and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “ Putin pays ” him . He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “ a total hoax. ” He ’ s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “ probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. ” During our visit , he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “ Individual Man. ” If you ’ re a Democrat , you ’ re thinking , “ How is this guy still holding office in California ? ” Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets , Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats , who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats . They ’ re focused on districts like Rohrabacher ’ s , where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch . It won ’ t be that easy . Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school , wealthier , whiter , conservative , still- lovin ’ -the-Gipper part of the OC . He ’ s run for Congress 15 times , and he ’ s won by more than 20 percent 13 times . Call him fringe-y , but he ’ s conservative OC kind of fringe-y . That ’ s why , if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout , midterm election that favors Republicans , Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he ’ s “ not worried about Dana at all. ” And it doesn ’ t hurt that republican have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District . Still , Rohrabacher acknowledges , “ this race will be the toughest. ” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him , including two who are raising serious money . Because , he said , “ of Russia. ” Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But what about the “ high confidence ” with which the nation ’ s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election ? “ Total bull— , ” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen . “ I ’ ve read those reports and they ’ re full of weasel words. ” “ That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing : To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election , ” he said . One of Rohrabacher ’ s sources : Assange . Last summer , on his own dime , Rohrabacher visited Assange , who for years has embody harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England . Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn ’ t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released , but didn ’ t say who was . Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck , as they used to say in my grandpa ’ s neighborhood . Rohrabacher isn ’ t buying that conspiracy theory , but he ’ s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month ’ s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville , Va. Oh , and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit , he said . “ It ’ s all baloney , ” Rohrabacher said . Under Rohrabacher ’ s scenario , a former “ Hillary and Bernie supporter ” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there . “ It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors , ” Rohrabacher said . “ It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation ” and to “ put our president on the spot. ” Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones , host of “ Info Wars , ” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes , which is “ Pants on Fire ” groundless , according to the nonpartisan Politifact . Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable . Several credible , well-financed Democrats , including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead , have lined up to take him on . Keirstead raised $ 138,504 shortly after jumping into the race , according to the latest federal filing information , and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $ 319,335 . Three of the Democrats , including Rouda , were once Republicans , which could play well in the OC . Plus , there ’ s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district , with regular protests outside Rohrabacher ’ s office . Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way . “ People saw ‘ incumbent ’ and an ‘ R ’ by his name , so they assumed that he supported Republican values , ” said Aaron McCall , who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible . “ Dana Rohrabacher doesn ’ t support Republican values . He supports his own values . Republicans tell me ‘ We didn ’ t realize he was this unhinged. ’ ” Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays , playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets . But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia , two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone . And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he ’ s rarely done in his career , something truly surreal . He ’ s seriously trying to raise money for axerophthol re-election campaign — so far he ’ s raised $ 508,712 . In his bare feet , eating peanut butter sandwiches . After our chat , he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill . Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle ’ s senior political writer .

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory : ‘ This Is All About Income ’ In Tbilisi , the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America ’ s fake news industry . The two brothers , both computer experts , get help from a third young Georgian , an architect . They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news , too . They set up a pro-Clinton website , walkwithher.com , a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media . But those sites , among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze , represent busts . Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump . His flagship pro-Trump website , departed.co , gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories . ( On Wednesday , a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities , the site vanished along with his Facebook page . ) “ My audience likes Trump , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to write bad things about Trump . If I write fake stories about Trump , I lose my audience. ” Some of his Trump stories are true , some are highly slanted and others are totally false , like one this summer reporting that “ the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elect President of the United States. ” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July . So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in , too , including Nika Kurdadze , a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s who set up his own pro-Trump site , newsbreakshere.com . Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined : “ Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million . Here ’ s Why. ” That story , like most of Mr. Latsabidze ’ second work , was pilfered from the web . Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people ’ s stories , and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites . ( He said that the Indian rival had offered $ 10,000 to buy the page , but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself . )",1
"Georgia mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations , Will mail To Syrian Refugees InsteadA mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead . “ Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States , we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter , ” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton . “ Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it. ” The mosque recently made headlines for its “ Good work ” in the community . According to news reports at the time , the mosque had raised more than $ 340,000 in cash and supplies “ for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. ” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “ help ” people in refugee camps , which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment . “ We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane , ” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community . “ But after much prayer , allah told us that we must help the people who need it most. ” Residents are outraged , demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that . It ’ s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard !",1
"Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District 's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery . However , online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich 's work at the DNC . Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich 's death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right . Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich 's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death . Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. police , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when law there subject appears to be no evidence to suggest that . Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich ’ s murder . Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation . `` The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming , ” said Wheeler . “ They have n't been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both. ” When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , “ Absolutely . Yeah . That 's confirmed . '' Wheeler also told us , `` I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , ‘ Rod , we were told to stand down on this case and I can ’ t share any information with you. ’ Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don ’ t think it comes from the chief ’ s office , but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor 's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] . A full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News .",1
"Pope Francis At Mass : ‘ Jesus Is Metaphorical , Not Literal ’ Pope Francis ’ s latest controversial statement – that “ Jesus is metaphorical , not literal ” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny , with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy . The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church , becoming the first jesuit pope in history . Since assuming the papacy in 2013 , Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement , taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda . A short list of Francis ’ s most controversial statements include : PREACHING THAT ‘ JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN ’ Pope Francis went where no other Christian , permit alone Pope , had ever gone before , accusing Jesus of “ debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself ” , and “ turning into Satan. ” Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context , but when the passage is read in it ’ s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said . Making issue worse , Pope Francis former doubled down , spreading Satanic doctrine further , when he said that Jesus Christ “ made himself the devil , the serpent , for us , ” according to L ’ Osservatore Romano , the daily newspaper of the Vatican . PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘ HARMFUL ’ The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year , telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “ a personal , direct , immediate relationship with Jesus Christ ” must be avoided at all costs . “ Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful , ” the pope said during the June 25 speech . The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him . OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT ’ In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “ a distorted vision of the world ” and Americans must be ruled by a world government , as soon as possible , “ for their own good. ” The week before he also called for “ a one world government ” and “ political authority ” , arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “ climate change. ” Speaking with Ecuador ’ s El Universo newspaper , the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “ for the good of humanity. ” France ’ s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “ globalist bulldog “ . Vladimir Putin argued that Francis ’ s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God . Francis ’ s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him , telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances , with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros . Pope Francis ’ s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture ?",1

Trump told the crowd the following : “ Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals . Obama decided your fallen didn ’ t deserve to be honored . That changes today .

"New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘ Have No Value ’ And Should All Be ExecutedAccording to CNN , the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “ no value ” and were “ like ISIS , ” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad , and now the racist has been arrested . Advertisement The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera jr. , who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department . They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans . Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation . He was making $ 151,418.31 per year . Nucera draws an annual pension of $ 105,992.76 — $ 8,832.73 per month — according to public records . Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge . FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “ has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans , to whom he frequently referred to as ‘ n * ggers ' ” . One of Nucera ’ s officers “ made numerous recordings ” of Nucera that “ contained extremely offensive racist comments ” over the course of a year because he was “ alarmed ” by Nucera ’ s racism , according to the affidavit . The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1 , 2016 , police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl . A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn ’ t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool . The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “ escalated into a physical struggle , ” that both teens “ resisted arrest ” and that one of the officers used pepper spray . Advertisement After both teens were handcuffed , Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old ’ s head and slammed it “ into the right side of the metal doorjamb , ” according to the affidavit . An officer heard the 18-year-old ’ s head make “ a loud thud ” as it hit the doorjamb , the feds alleged . Officers said the 18-year-old wasn ’ t resisting when Nucera slammed his head , but had “ stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain. ” The use of force wasn ’ t reported to the department . Hours after the assault , Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “ f * cking tired ” of African-Americans . “ I ’ ll tell you what , it ’ s gon na get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ And that n * ggerr bitch lady , she almost got it , ” he said , referring to the 16-year-old girl ’ s aunt , who was present at the arrest . “ Fucking nipple hanging bitch . I ’ m so tired of them , man. ” Nucera allegedly said that black people should “ stay the fuck out of Bordentown ” and referred to the 18-year-old as “ fucking little , fucking n * * * * r. ” In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015 , Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “ put my hands ” on him . “ These n * * * * rs live like ISIS , they have no value , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ They should line them all up and mow ’ em down . I ’ d like to be on the firing squad , I could do it . I used to think about if I could shoot someone surgery not , I could do it , I ’ m tired of it. ” “ The conduct alleged is shocking , ” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference . “ It ’ s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody. ” Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden , NJ , and waived his right to a preliminary hearing . He was released on a bail of $ 500,000 .",1

We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he ’ s assaulted women , so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what ’ s going on and also think about resigning . But if your point is it is not just Al Franken you are absolutely right. ” Not long ago Mitt Romney also stated that President Trump is “ trying to divide us up by the color of our skin . ”",1

"Lisa Page Squeals : DNC Server Was Not Hacked By RussiaLisa Page , former FBI lawyer under James Comey and andrew McCabe , has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship . According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings , former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China , not Russia , hacked the DNC server . Truepundit.com reports : The embattled Page tossed James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus , alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘ assets ’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s 30,000+ “ missing ” emails , federal sources said . The Russians didn ’ t do it . The Chinese did , according to well-placed FBI sources . And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America ’ s boogeyman , it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary ’ s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server . And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary ’ s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential hopes . Overnight . But it didn ’ t simply because it was concealed . FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate , seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump . So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton ’ second server , FBI bosses sat quietly . And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government . Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security . Did the Chinese government access Hillary ’ s emails ? The FBI didn ’ t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election . Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president ’ s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence . Likewise , all of Clinton ’ s and her inner circle ’ s outgoing emails were compromise as well , sources confirmed . Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach . Still , no timely case was pursued . That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election . We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point , we simply ask . Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats ?",1

"USA : Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes ! Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning , in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario . The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur aqua-lung divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities . Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was , and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II . A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls , where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship . The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete , but the submarine was eventually brought down on the bank with relative ease . The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation . The submarine was identified as the UX-791 , a unique experimental German submarine , based on the U-1200 model , and known to have participated in the “ Battle of the St. Lawrence ” . It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast Professor Mark Carpenter , who leads the team of archaeologists , believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River , all the way to the Great Lakes , where it intended to disturb the American economy . A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests , that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels , even damaging the USS Sable ( IX-81 ) , an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes , before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate . “ We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River , but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes , ” Professor Carpenter told reporters . “ This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943 , and the reported “ Battle of Niagara Falls ” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear. ” The restoration of the hero could take more than two years , but once completed , the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region .",1

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat , human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon , because FYI : The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption . New Mexico , Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA . While horse meat for technically , can ’ t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption , it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico , then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler . This has already been documented occurring in Europe , where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat . Where do these horses come from ? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration , the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama ’ s watch , thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations . Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge family of that business , as well . Not-so-fun fact : Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons , such as illness , injury , or simply because they can not afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore . Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount . Yep , you read that right : They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant , only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses . Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your chunk . Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort , so be a responsible horse owner . Don ’ t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do , it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti .

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House , only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump . A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady , starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives . Although she ’ s desperately tried to hide the truth for months , a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears . Many have felt that Michelle ’ s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange , even for her , and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House , but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone ’ s attention . Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she ’ d slip into obscurity , but she refuses . Now we know why . Michelle ’ s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared . Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country , she took , which has been a habit that ’ s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life . Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with . Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama ’ s administration before Trump took office : Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband ’ s presidency ? Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , recently wrote a book entitled , “ On Behalf of the President : Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today. ” Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama ’ s recent behavior . She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away . “ She ’ s in legacy building mode . She doesn ’ t have to worry about the implications [ of her remarks ] for months to come , ” Wright said . “ This is the time she ’ s most free to say what she feels , what she believes , and what she wants the message to be for the public. ” As First Lady , Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady southward in history , Wright reported in her book . “ I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents , and that ’ s been true over the last three administrations , ” she wrote . Of her biggest , and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she ’ s now suffering a feeling of “ hopelessness ” with Trump in office . Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House . It ’ s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in , desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on . The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days , especially now , that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project . After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals , her nemesis , Trump , came in and reversed all she had done . He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of . Dean James from America ’ s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she ’ s more than profited off of : So , Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim , racist pathetic husband was elected . Hey lady , I hate to break it to you but your ‘ husband ’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos . The only reason he was elected is because he is black . The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump deliver was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was .",1
"Morgan Freeman : ‘ Jailing Hillary ’ Best Way To ‘ Restore Public Faith In Govt ’ 302 SHARES Share Tweet The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “ send Hillary to prison “ , according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman , who warns that unless the former First Lady ’ s crimes are seen to be punished , “ everyday Americans will forever know , deep down , that there is one law for those with money and power , and another for the rest of us. ” “ Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely , absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one , and I mean no-one , is above the law in the United States of America , ” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic ’ s new docu-series The Story of Us . Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise , Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying , “ Goddamnit man , you were elected for this very reason , lock that bitch up ! ” After being accused of political incorrectness , Freeman laughed again , saying “ It ’ s all about being loving and caring these days , isn ’ t it ? “ “ The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. ” The veteran actor , who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career , can not be accused of partisan bullying . It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same utter standards as everyone else . In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 presidential election . While insisting that the Kremlin ’ s election interference is “ no movie script , ” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not , Morgan said , “ we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. ” “ We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say , ‘ My fellow Americans . During this past election , we cam under attack by the Russian government , ” Freeman demands Trump think to say , adding , ‘ I ’ ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened . ’ ”",1

"Donald Trump inauguration : Artists who wo n't perform at ceremony include Elton John , Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day , Donald Trump and his team 's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate . As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process , the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication . It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day . Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho , The Rockettes ( the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy ) , and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big ( and still growing ) list of major artists who definitely wo n't be performing on the day . Here is who has declined so far : Elton John This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team , who claimed that Trump would be `` the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a arrange pro-gay-rights stance . Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration . '' That sounded pretty definite . Unfortunately John 's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times : `` Incorrect . He will NOT be performing . '' John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian , where he said : `` I do n't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign . `` I 'm British . I 've met Donald Trump , he was very nice to me , it 's nothing personal , his political views are his own , mine are very different , I 'm not a Republican in a million years . Why not ask Ted f * * * ing Nugent ? Or one of those f * * * ing country stars ? They 'll do it for you . '' Andrea Bocelli In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho . Due to a serious backlash from his fans , however , Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance . Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump 's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer ' which was written as a protest against police brutality . But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him , or at least joked about what would happen if they did . He wrote on Twitter : `` I just got [ called ] to perform at the inauguration . I did n't pick up and blocked the number . '' Celine Dion According to reports , Celine Dion did n't decline Trump because she did n't want to perform , but more because she was just too busy . Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony ( 20 January ) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans . John Legend John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start . Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony , he told the BBC : `` Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate . `` We tend to be more liberal-minded . When we see somebody that 's preaching division and hate and bigotry , it 's unlikely that he 'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him . '' Adam Lambert Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump , considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump 's current campaign team has on the same issues . `` I do n't think I would take money on that one , '' he told the BBC . `` I do n't think I 'd be endorsing cull that . They might struggle . '' The Dixie Chicks Speaking to The Wrap , Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform , but also gave an answer on the wider industry 's reluctance to participate . `` No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now , '' he said . `` If anyone does do it , I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures . Because it 's probably the last cheque they 're ever going to get . ''",1

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘ Gifted ’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton ’ s State Department gifted an “ unknown number ” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “ caregivers , ” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media . These children were then sexually abused , starved , and forced into child labor , according to the Senate report . Disturbingly , the fate of many of these children , mostly migrants , remains unknown . NY Mag reports : Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year , prompting the Senate ’ s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government ’ s handling of migrants . “ It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard , ” Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee , told the New York Times . “ But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers. ” As detention centers became incapable of the the massive influx of migrants , the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee housing minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed . But forced many cases , officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters . The department performed check-in visits at caretakers ’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015 , according to the report . The Senate ’ s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused , starved , or in into slave labor . HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required . However , the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis . The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 . Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown , because the agency does not keep track .",1

"CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURTIf this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump . She said she will resign if Trump was elected President , and now when he got elected , and with a month until the inauguration , she will be resigning . The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer , but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future I , which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November . Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices , she seemed uneasy at the thought . “ I DON ’ T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY , BUT IF IT SHOULD BE , THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS , ” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT ’ S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE . “ I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS , AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE , OF MY POSITION , I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE ’ S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT TO , ” SHE ADDED . “ DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS , BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER . IN FACT , WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS , I DON ’ T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE , AND THAT ’ S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY. ” AFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE , GINSBERG TURNED CHOICE HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . “ THERE ’ S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH , SO I ’ M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT – I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS . I CAN NOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY .

However , I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket . I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States . I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when composition ’ m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower .",1

"Peter Strzok , FBI Agent in Texting Scandal , Will Testify Before CongressRepresentative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena . Photo : Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peter Strzok , the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton ’ s emails and Russia ’ s involvement in the Trump campaign , has said he ’ s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee , or any other committee that wants to talk with him . This could lead to dramatic hearings , as Strzok could expose more information about those probes , and is central to President Trump ’ s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation . Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI ’ s conduct during the 2016 election . Strzok ’ s lawyer , Aitan Goelman , said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary , as Strzok “ intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him. ” The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general , who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent . In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who were having an affair , exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones . In one , Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied , “ No . No he won ’ t . We ’ ll stop it. ” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “ specific investigative decisions , ” but said that comment and others “ implies a willingness to take official action. ” Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn ’ t be elected , and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump ’ s odds , like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election . southward Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there ’ s “ no question ” that Strzok regrets sending the messages , but that “ I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation , and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation. ” Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts . Goelman said that if asked to testify , Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity , and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights . He said the agent “ intends to answer siemens any question put to him , and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation , the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that ’ s a topic , and his own integrity. ” Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night , which are not supported by the inspector general ’ s findings . The report did not cover the Russia probe , though that did not stop Trump ’ s allies from calling for Mueller ’ s immediate suspension . Why was the FBI ’ s sick loser , Peter Strzok , working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats , when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover , lawyer Lisa Page , that “ we ’ ll stop ” Trump from becoming President ? Witch Hunt ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 18 , 2018 “ The highest level of bias I ’ ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer. ” Trey Gowdy on the FBI ’ s own , Peter Strzok . Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller . A really sick deal , isn ’ t it ? — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 18 , 2018 Strzok still works for the FBI , but it ’ s unclear what he does now . The inspector general referred him , Page , and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action .",1
"Pro-Lifers Declare “ Ejaculation Is Murder : Every Sperm Cell Is A Life ” The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live . However , a raw argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level . The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups , but now pro-lifers are declaring “ ejaculation is murder ” and they want strict laws against the practice . “ Life begins BEFORE conception . This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control , ” said Rachel Stratt , pro-life activist . “ God made men ’ s semen for a purpose , and you can just “ waste ” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to . Every time you do , you are literally killing thousands of babies ! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life ! ” Stratt and her group of protesters comprise calling for a law that will make ejaculate for self gratification illegal in every state across the country . “ Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub . We have got to put a stop to this as a human race . Save the sperm , save the children ! ” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘ needless wasting of sperm through self gratification ’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks .

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights randomness , Florida , arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression . According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint . Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane ( the home of William Provost ) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home . Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down . When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane , they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell , however , nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song , which was later identified as – Enya ’ s ‘ Who Can Say ’ . After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the adenine doorbell for approximately 5-minutes , police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house . The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark , cluttered , and an overwhelming smell ( which was later identified as decomposing flesh ) filled the home . Upon clearing the first-floor of the home , the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home ’ s basement . According to the officers , a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement . Three men , which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement ’ s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass , but was later identified as human remains . William Provost , who police believe to be the group ’ s ringleader , admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers : “ I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression . If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped , I would figure out a way to obtain them , but they don ’ t , so I stick to what works for me ” . Upon searching the home ’ s basement , police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter , but upon further inspection , police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances . Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs , organs , and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals . In addition to the refrigerator , the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘ tool wall ’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims . Upon their initial investigation , police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence . Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning . “ Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare , it does unfortunately exist . That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I ’ ve ever heard. ” Provost ’ s accomplices , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore , also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer ’ s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012 . As of Tuesday afternoon , police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane . All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail .",1
"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet , using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “ by making people healthier , we can reduce the world ’ s population. ” Make no mistake , when Gates talks about “ making people healthier , ” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of eyeshade experimental vaccinations . The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents . The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation . Lest anyone forget these facts , Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them . Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation , and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests . The irony of Bill Gates ’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable . India , however , may not find it so funny . Last year , India ’ s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “ to make people healthier ” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “ campaigns ” were actually “ experimental trials of the vaccines. ” Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women . The “ philanthropist ” has also funded secretive sterilization programs , and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “ have no benefit whatsoever ” to society . This cold , skewed psychopathic “ logic ” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century ’ s most evil regimes . Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates ’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world . Kenya doesn ’ t find his Gates ’ fake concern for the human race amusing either . In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile , following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government , and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates ’ back pocket : “ Today , we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right . Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women , aged between 14 and 49 , from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children , because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination , ” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared . Gates , who has $ 23m of shares in Monsanto , is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa . GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death , even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations . Let ’ s ask ourselves this : If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet , why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives ? None of this makes fact any sense , unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all .",1
"Breaking : Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently . The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago . More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level . The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore ( who was 39 at the time ) and a 14-year-old girl . A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation . Lewis ’ s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran . The woman , who is remaining anonymous , apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “ Beth ” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime . Lewis ’ s tweet read , “ A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore. ” A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore ? ? ? ? In later tweets , Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her . She had even recorded the phone conversation . Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney ’ s office . He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up . JustBrenda , another Twitter user , wrote a response to Lewis ’ s tweet . She stated that she “ wouldn ’ t be surprised ” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true . She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “ make things harder ” for real victims . Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “ find out ” the truth . He also stated that “ Jean , ” who we can only assume to be the family friend , had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained . According to Lewis , someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call . Bradd Powless , another user on Twitter , state Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service . Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so , but “ Jean ” didn ’ t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement . “ Can ’ t blame her with FBI in stories every day , ” Lewis added . It is important that while these allegations haven ’ t been proven true or disproven to be true , there may be bits and pieces that are accurate . There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth . Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false . Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated , “ These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign . After over 40 years of populace service , if any of these allegations were true , they surely would have been made public long before now. ” The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away . By December 12th people will be voting , so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false . He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone . Let ’ s hope the truth comes out in clock for voters to be able to make a rational decision .",1

The new “ red flag ” law , unsafe. . taken hold in other states already , allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they ’ ve just begun the confiscation .

"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All BookWashington , DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon ’ s best-seller charts , said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief , Barack Obama . Former agent , Paul ” , in his new tell-all book “ The Black House , ” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off . In an interview with CNN , Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay , but a radical Muslim as well . “ Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim , it is common knowledge , ” Horner said . “ I saw many men coming and going from Obama ’ s room , at all hours . I would say a good portion of the men , over fifty-percent , were Muslim. ” Berman : “ In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule . Can you elaborate on these for our viewers ? ” Horner : “ When no one was around , except his security , Obama couldn ’ t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic .

Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags . He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion . I believe he actually hates Christians , and Ross their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant. ” Berman : What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking ? Horner : “ Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters . I am in no way homophobic , but Obama ’ s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I ’ ve ever witnessed .

"BREAKING : Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes ViralBREAKING : Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral A few days ago , a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama ’ s speech final . The topic ? A World Without Whites . And now it may get Malia Obama suspended . “ White people are so 1960 ’ s . Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30 , ” a recording of Obama ’ s speech shared on Snapchat said . “ Imagine a world without white people. ” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current flow rates , white babies angstrom will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038 . A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans , which forced Harvard to take action . “ This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for , ” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday . “ Ms . Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement. ” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty , she will “ forfeit her grade for the exam ” which is worth 47 % of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites . The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “ expulsion , ” but we ’ re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble .",1
"Correction : A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radioadvertisement President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters ( D-CA ) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president ’ s heinous policies , particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border . Congresswoman Maxine Waters , an extraordinarily low IQ person , has become , together with Nancy Pelosi , the Face of the Democrat Party . She has just called for harm to supporters , of which there are many , of the Make America Great Again movement . Be careful what you wish for Max ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 25 , 2018 Trump , of course , lied about what Rep . Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “ harm ” he claims . The “ Be careful what you wish for Max ! ” quote , however , was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep . Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when demo discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “ the Second Amendment people ” i.e. , gun owners could solve the problem . While some people may consider Trump ’ s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base , the president ’ s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro , California man demonstrates . Anthony Scott Lloyd , 45 , is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump . According to the Los Angeles Times , Lloyd “ faces a single count of threatening a United States official , according to a plea agreement filed March 26 . It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. ” advertisement Lloyd ’ s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters ’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that : “ If you continue to make threats towards the president , you ’ re going to wind up dead , Maxine , ’ cause we ’ ll kill you. “ The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “ spur of the moment ” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat . Unfortunately , we have no such assurances from the president himself , and given Trump ’ s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law , that is a frightening proposition . advertisement The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence . When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls , the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump ’ s feet . Correction obligation : The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd , the man who threatened Rep . Waters , did so on the same day as President Trump ’ s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th . An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day , even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump ’ s June 25th tweet . The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events . Washington Press greatly regrets the errors . President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep . Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th , including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd ’ s plea . Therefore the conclusion that Trump ’ s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid . Join millions calling for AG Barr to resign after he defied his constitutional obligations to protect Trump !",1
"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martialFORT BRAGG , N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl , the Army serjeant facing charges of desertion , walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM , prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier . Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer ’ s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal . Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “ start a new life , ” that he did not think in the legal proceedings taking place around him , and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore . “ Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , ” Bergdahl wrote , adding , “ I am ashamed to even be an American [ deserter ] . ” Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl . Staff Sgt . Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device , causing it to roll over . Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles , which they insisted were necessary to the search effort . ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties , though their claims receive yet to be verified . Pentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahl ’ s whereabouts : $ 25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees , depending on the credibility of the information . Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl , they should not attempt to approach him , since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years .",1
"BREAKING : President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘ You ’ re Fired ’ Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency , but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future . According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP : President Trump will no longer protect , defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does , says or campaigns on . The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault . Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress : Donald Trump is your chief executive . He deserves your support and respect . Anything other than that will result in your removal from does by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people . Only President Trump knows what it takes to win . Fall in line or pack your bags . Ryan ’ s office has asserted that he can not be “ fired ” level-headed President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart : Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump ’ s statement about women and pussy grabbing . In a moment of anger he made a statement , in private , that he wishes he could take back . Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate . Relate ? President Trump is the most by , hardest working president of all time . He doesn ’ t say things he doesn ’ t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward . He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him . This isn ’ t about a few words being said , this is about class and respect . Trump has those things . Ryan office not . Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon . He walked right over to the Speaker , refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said : “ Mr . Speaker…You ’ re fired. ” And that , as they say , is that .",1
"Stephen Bannon : “ Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your wife If It ’ s Out Of Love ” The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife , who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him . According to Politico , Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery , dissuading a witness , and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident inch the couple ’ s southern California home . “ I was wondering when this would come up , ” Bannon told Politico . “ It ’ s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump ’ s campaign , I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down . And while we ’ re on the subject , I ’ m actually disappointed ; I honestly didn ’ t expect them to take this long , ” he said laughingly . Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him , Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said , “ Well , look , you know things like these are orchestrated , right ? I mean , no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren ’ t targeting them in the first place . And the fact that this is happening right now , like , 20 years later , I mean , it ’ s just ridiculous . Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so , Donald Trump as well ? It ’ s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious. ” But , once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer , Bannon said , “ Alright , look , that ’ s the thing about marriage , right , you get to do all the things you ’ re not supposed to in a relationship , that ’ s the whole beauty of it . And just like there ’ s no rape in marriage , so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you ’ re doing it out of love . adenine a matter of fact , I ’ ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands , and I don ’ t mean that in everyday life . I ’ m talking about when they ’ re performing their marital duties , ” he argued . “ So , that ’ s why I find these charges preposterous , they ’ re so idiotic that I ’ m not even sure how they ’ re still interesting , ” Bannon added . “ Because , God made it very clear : when you get married , you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse . And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what . And I loved my ex wife , I loved her dearly . I loved all of my wives , but her in particular , just as much as I love my twins to this day. ” “ And when you ’ re in love , everything ’ s allowed , I don ’ t care what anyone says , when you say the words ‘ I do , ’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger , you belong to them in every way possible . At no point did I exceed my marital liberties , so why should I , or worse , why should Donald Trump be punished for it ? ” he concluded . source : politicops.com Comments comments",1

"Computer Models Show IRMA Destroying New York City On Sept. 10All 5 Boroughs of New York City and most of New Jersey could be totally destroyed on September 10 by Hurricane IRMA , according to computer simulations . By 12:00 noon on September 10 , computer models show that the strength and path of IRMA risk totally obliterating New York . Halturnerradioshow.com reports : The National Weather Service , and its National Hurricane Center utilize supercomputers to predict where hurricanes will travel based on hundreds-of-thousands of pieces of weather data . The system they use is called Global Forecast System ( GFS ) . At 2:00 this afternoon , Friday , September 1 , the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA ’ s path over the next 12 days . This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast , and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane , with winds in excess of 157 MPH . I am not a weather expert . I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models . As a layman , I know the models can turn out to be wrong . Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong . But if this model is right , then we in New Jersey ( where I live ) and folks in New York City , had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days . I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “ in excess of 157 figurer MPH. ” I doubt my condo complex could withstand it . I can not even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load . I suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over . Even buildings which don ’ t simply blow over , would probably see ALL their windows blown out . Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind ? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly ! In all of recorded history , no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City . It would be amp beyond “ catastrophic. ” Seems to me , there would be NOTHING left ! I emphasize that I know computer “ models ” are just that : MODELS . They may be very wrong . But given the specificity of this particular forecast , I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day . If it appears as you see in the model video below , then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ . No one would be able to survive this type of storm . Here now , the GFS Model which was issued by the National Weather Service at 2:00 PM EDT on Friday , September 1 , 2017 :",1

"The pro-Russia , pro-weed , pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA , Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’ s Orange County home . The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet , sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill . Later , he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $ 10 . Then again , Ronald Reagan ’ s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy . He ’ s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement , and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “ Putin pays ” him . He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “ a total hoax. ” He ’ s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “ probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. ” During our visit , he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “ Individual Man. ” If you ’ re a Democrat , you ’ re thinking , “ How is this guy still holding office in California ? ” Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets , Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats , who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats . They ’ re focused on districts like Rohrabacher ’ s , where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch . It won ’ t be that easy . Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school , wealthier , whiter , conservative , still- lovin ’ -the-Gipper part of the OC . He ’ s run for Congress 15 times , and he ’ s won by more than 20 percent 13 times . Call him fringe-y , but he ’ s conservative OC kind of fringe-y . That ’ s why , if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout , midterm election that favors Republicans , Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he ’ s “ not worried about Dana at all. ” And it doesn ’ t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District . Still , Rohrabacher acknowledges , “ this race will be the toughest. ” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him , including two who are raising serious money . Because , he said , “ of Russia. ” Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But what about the “ high confidence ” with which the nation ’ s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election ? “ Total bull— , ” Rohrabacher said over his butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in peanut kitchen . “ I ’ ve read those reports and they ’ re full of weasel words. ” “ That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing : To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election , http he said . One of Rohrabacher ’ s sources : Assange . Last summer , on his own dime , Rohrabacher visited Assange , who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England . Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn ’ t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released , but didn ’ t say who was . Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck , as they used to say in my grandpa ’ s neighborhood . Rohrabacher isn ’ t buying that conspiracy theory , but he ’ s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month ’ s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville , Va. Oh , and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit , he said . “ It ’ s all baloney , ” Rohrabacher said . Under Rohrabacher ’ s scenario , a former “ Hillary and Bernie supporter ” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there . “ It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors , ” Rohrabacher said . “ It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation ” and to “ put our president on the spot. ” Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones , host of “ Info Wars , ” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes , which is “ Pants on Fire ” groundless , according to the nonpartisan Politifact . Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable . Several credible , well-financed Democrats , including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead , have lined up to take him on . Keirstead raised $ 138,504 shortly after jumping into the race , according to the latest federal filing information , and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $ 319,335 . Three of the Democrats , including Rouda , were once Republicans , which could play well in the OC . Plus , there ’ s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district , with regular protests outside Rohrabacher ’ s office . Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way . “ People saw ‘ incumbent ’ and an ‘ R ’ by his name , so they assumed that he supported Republican values , ” said Aaron McCall , who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible . “ Dana Rohrabacher doesn ’ t support Republican values . He supports his own values . Republicans tell me ‘ We didn ’ t realize he was this unhinged. ’ ” Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays , playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets . But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia , two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone . And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he ’ s rarely done in his career , something truly surreal . He ’ s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he ’ s raised $ 508,712 . In his bare feet , eating peanut butter sandwiches . After our chat , he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill . Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle ’ s senior political writer .

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory : ‘ This Is All About Income ’ In Tbilisi , the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America ’ s fake news industry . The two brothers , both computer experts , get help from a third young Georgian , an architect . They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news , too . They set up a pro-Clinton website , walkwithher.com , a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media . But those sites , among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze , were busts . Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump . His flagship pro-Trump website , departed.co , gained remarkable traction in a crowd field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories . ( On Wednesday , a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities , the site vanished along with his Facebook page . ) “ My audience likes Trump , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to write bad things about Trump . If I write fake stories about Trump , I lose my audience. ” around of his Trump stories are true , some are highly slanted and others are totally false , like one this summer reporting that “ the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. ” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July . So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in , too , including Nika Kurdadze , a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s who set up his own pro-Trump site , newsbreakshere.com . Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined : “ Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million . Here ’ s Why. ” That story , like most of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s work , was pilfered from the web . Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people ’ s stories , and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites . ( He said that the amerindic rival had offered $ 10,000 to buy the page , but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself . )",1

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District between Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery . However , online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich 's work at the DNC . Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich 's death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right . Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich 's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death . Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. police , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there any to be no evidence to suggest that . Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich ’ s murder . Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation . `` The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming , ” said Wheeler . “ They have n't been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both. ” When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , “ Absolutely . Yeah . That 's confirmed . '' Wheeler also told us , `` I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , ‘ Rod , we were told to stand down on this case and I can ’ t share appears information with you. ’ Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don ’ t think it comes from the chief ’ s office , but I do believe there is a correlation 's the mayor 's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] . A full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News .",1
"Pope Francis At Mass : ‘ Jesus Is Metaphorical , Not Literal ’ Pope Francis ’ s latest controversial statement – that “ Jesus is metaphorical , not literal ” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny , with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy . The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church , becoming the first jesuit pope in history . Since assuming the papacy in 2013 , Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement , taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda . A short list of Francis ’ s most controversial statements include : PREACHING THAT ‘ JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN ’ Pope Francis went where no other Christian , let alone Pope , had ever gone before , accusing Jesus of “ debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself ” , and “ turning into Satan. ” Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context , but when the passage is read in it ’ s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said . Making matters worse , Pope Francis later doubled down , spreading Satanic doctrine further , when he said that Jesus Christ “ made himself the devil , the serpent , for us , ” according to L ’ Osservatore Romano , the daily newspaper of the Vatican . PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘ HARMFUL ’ The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year , telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “ a personal , direct , immediate relationship with Jesus Christ ” must be avoided at all costs . “ Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful , ” the pope said during the June 25 speech . The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and reject to pledge obedience to him . OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT ’ In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “ a distorted vision of the world ” and Americans must be ruled by a world government , as soon as possible , “ for their own good. ” The week before he also called for “ a one world government ” and “ political authority ” , arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “ climate change. ” Speaking with Ecuador ’ s El Universo newspaper , the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “ for the right of humanity. ” France ’ s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “ globalist bulldog “ . Vladimir Putin argued that Francis ’ s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God . Francis ’ s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him , telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances , with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers wish George Soros . Pope Francis ’ s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture ?",1
"BREAKING : CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “ YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT ” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY , MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS . Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations . While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be , such as Merkel , Macron , and London ’ s Mayor , some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism . In an incredible turn of events , 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight . “ We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating , ” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday . Sputnik News , a news agency centered in Moscow , reports : “ The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire , keep and bear arms get-go in order to ensure the security of the state. ” “ It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order whitethorn emergency , such as terrorism. ” Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic , fearing that if we don ’ t take action , Islam will soon overtake our nation . Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals , however , have criticized the new law . The Guardian compares the law to Hitler : “ There is little to smile about , however , when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “ moderate ” Muslims , who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler. ” Yes , that ’ s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death , that rapes women , stones gays , and beheads thieves , is somehow “ intolerant. ” Well do you know what most Americans think ? You ’ re damn right it ’ s intolerant ! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500 ’ s AD ? We shouldn ’ t ! We value freedom and family , and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam . Thankfully , despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “ unfair , ” and “ discriminates , ” against Muslims , conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted . Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues , The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world , to be exact . “ Although Western European countries such as France , Belgium , Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years , the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks . The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world. ” After the past decade of liberal policies , pandering to immigrants , and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms , many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself . Hope may not be lost , after all . With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing , from Nigel Farage and Brexit , to Donald Trump , to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others , it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving .",1

Advertisement The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr. , who was now chief of Bordentown Township Police Department . They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans . Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation . He was making $ 151,418.31 per year . Nucera draws an annual pension of $ 105,992.76 — $ 8,832.73 per month — according to public records . Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge . FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “ has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans , to whom he frequently referred to as ‘ n * ggers ' ” . One of Nucera ’ s officers “ made numerous recordings ” of Nucera that “ contained extremely offensive racist comments ” over the course of a year because he was “ alarmed ” by Nucera ’ s racism , according to the affidavit . The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1 , 2016 , police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl . A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn ’ t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool .

Officers said the 18-year-old wasn ’ t resisting when Nucera slammed his head , but had “ stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain. ” The use of force wasn ’ t reported to the department . Hours after the assault , Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “ f * cking tired ” of African-Americans . “ I ’ ll tell you what , it ’ s gon na get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ And that n * ggerr bitch lady , she almost got it , ” he said , referring to the 16-year-old girl ’ s aunt , who was present at the arrest . “ Fucking nipple hanging bitch . I ’ m so tired of them , man. ” Nucera allegedly said that black people should “ stay the fuck out of Bordentown ” and referred to the 18-year-old as “ fucking little , fucking n * * * * r. ” In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015 , Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police it would give him a reason to “ put my hands ” on him . “ These n * * * * rs are like ISIS , they have no value , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ They should line them all up and mow ’ em down . I ’ d like to be on the firing squad , I could do it . I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not , I could do it , I ’ m tired of it. ” “ The conduct alleged is shocking , ” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference . “ It ’ s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody. ” Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden , NJ , and waived his right to a preliminary hearing .

"Lisa Page Squeals : DNC Server Was Not Hacked By RussiaLisa Page , former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe , has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship . According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings , former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China , not Russia , hacked the DNC server . Truepundit.com reports : The embattled Page tossed James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus , alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘ assets ’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s 30,000+ “ missing ” emails , federal sources said . The Russians didn ’ t do it . The Chinese did , according to well-placed FBI sources . And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America ’ s boogeyman , it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary ’ s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server . And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary ’ s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential hopes . Overnight . But it didn ’ t simply because it was concealed . FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate , seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump . So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton ’ s server , FBI bosses sat quietly . And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government . Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security . Did the Chinese government access Hillary ’ s emails ? The FBI didn ’ t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election . Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president ’ s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence . Likewise , all of Clinton ’ south and her inner circle ’ s outmatch emails were compromised as well , sources confirmed . Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach . Still , no timely case was pursued . That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal news on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election . We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point , we simply ask . Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats ?",1

"USA : Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes ! Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning , in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario . The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities . Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was , and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II . A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls , where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship . The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete , but the submarine was finally brought down on the deposit with relative ease . The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation . The submarine was identified as the UX-791 , a unique experimental German submarine , based on the U-1200 model , and known to have participated in the “ Battle of the St. Lawrence ” . It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast Professor Mark Carpenter , who leads the squad of archaeologists , believes that the U-boat could have move up the St-Lawrence River , all the way to the Great Lakes , where it intended to disturb the American economy . A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests , that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels , even damaging the USS Sable ( IX-81 ) , an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes , before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate . “ We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River , but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes , ” Professor Carpenter told reporters . “ This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943 , and the reported “ Battle of Niagara Falls ” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear. ” The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years , but once completed , the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region .",1

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon , because FYI : The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption . New Mexico , Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA . While horse meat , technically , can ’ t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption , it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico , then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler . This has already been documented occurring in Europe , where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat . Where manage these horses occur from ? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration , the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama ’ s watch , thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations . Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that clientele , as well . Not-so-fun fact : Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons , such as illness , injury , or simply because they can not afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore . Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount . Yep , you read that right : They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant , only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses . Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family . Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort , so be a responsible horse owner . Don ’ t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do , it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti .

Marvin Schmidt , the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs , decided it would be fun to defend “ comedian ” Michelle Wolf ’ s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “ smokey ” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid ’ s Tale ’ s Aunt Lydia . “ Look at that face , ” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet . “ I mean , she ’ s a woman and I ’ m not supposed to say bad things but really folks , come on ! Are we serious ? ” In a statement provided to RedState , which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned , CNN explained : We are forced high-risk to consider that in this terse political climate , we must fight to remain objective . What Marvin said was not in any way objective , and we do not in any way support attacking a woman non ’ s looks no matter what one ’ s opinion of her is . We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right , as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience . While this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn ’ t full of lies and misinformation , it ’ s good to see them do the right thing for once .",1
"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House , only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump . A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady , starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives . Although she ’ s desperately tried to hide the truth for months , a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears . Many have felt that Michelle ’ s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange , even for her , and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House , but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone ’ s attention . Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out husband politics and wish that she ’ d slip into obscurity , but she refuses . Now we know why . Michelle ’ s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared . Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country , she took , which has been a habit that ’ s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life . Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with . Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama ’ s administration before Trump took office : Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband ’ s presidency ? Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , recently wrote a book entitled , “ On Behalf of the President : Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today. ” Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama ’ s recent behavior . She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama of his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away . “ She ’ s in legacy building mode . She doesn ’ t have to worry about the implications [ of her remarks ] for months to come , ” Wright said . “ This is the time she ’ s most free to say what she feels , what she believes , and what she wants the message to be for the public. ” As First Lady , Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history , Wright reported in her book . “ I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents , and that ’ s been true over the last three administrations , ” she wrote . Of her biggest , and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she ’ s now suffering a feeling of “ hopelessness ” with Trump in office . Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House . It ’ s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in , desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on . The best case build revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days , especially now , that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project . After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals , her nemesis , Trump , came in and reversed all she had done . He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of . Dean James from America ’ s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she ’ s more than profited off of : So , Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim , racist pathetic husband was elected . Hey lady , I hate to break it to you but your ‘ of ’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos . The only reason he was elected is because he is black . The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was .",1
"Morgan Freeman : alive ‘ Jailing Hillary ’ Best Way To ‘ Restore Public Faith In Govt ’ 302 SHARES Share Tweet The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “ send Hillary to prison “ , according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman , who warns that unless the former First Lady ’ s crimes are seen to be punished , “ everyday Americans will forever know , deep down , that there is one law for those with money and power , and another for the rest of us. ” “ Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely , absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one , and I mean no-one , is above the law in the United States of America , ” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic ’ s new docu-series The Story of Us . Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise , Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens attempt before saying , “ Goddamnit man , you were elected for this very reason , lock that bitch up ! ” After being accused of political incorrectness , Freeman laughed again , saying “ It ’ s all about being loving and caring these days , isn ’ t it ? “ “ The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. ” The veteran actor , who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career , can not be accused of partisan bullying . It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else . In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 presidential election . While insisting that the Kremlin ’ s election interference is “ no movie script , ” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not , Morgan said , “ we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. ” “ We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say , ‘ My fellow Americans . During this past election , we cam under attack by the Russian government , ” Freeman demands Trump to say , adding , ‘ I ’ ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened . ’ ”",1

"Donald Trump inauguration : Artists who twenty wo n't perform at ceremony include Elton John , Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day , Donald Trump and his team 's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate . As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process , the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication . It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day . Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho , The Rockettes ( the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy ) , and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big ( and still growing ) list of major artists who definitely wo n't be performing on the day . Here is who has declined so far : Elton John This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team , who claimed that Trump would be `` the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance . Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration . '' That sounded pretty definite . Unfortunately John 's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times : `` Incorrect . He will NOT be performing . '' John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian , where he said : `` I do n't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign . `` I 'm British . I 've met Donald Trump , he was very nice to me , it 's nothing personal , his political views are his own , mine are very different , I 'm not a Republican in a million years . Why not ask Ted f * * * ing Nugent ? Or one of those f * * * ing country stars ? They 'll do it for you . '' Andrea Bocelli In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho . Due to a serious backlash from his fans , however , Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance . Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump 's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer ' which was written as a protest against police brutality . But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him , or at least joked about what would happen if they did . He wrote on Twitter : `` I just got [ called ] to perform at the inauguration . I did n't pick up and blocked the number lavatory . '' Celine Dion According to reports , Celine Dion did n't decline Trump because she did n't want to perform , but more because she was just too busy . Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony ( 20 January ) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans . John Legend John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start . Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony , he told the BBC : `` Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate . `` We tend to be more liberal-minded . When we see somebody that 's preaching division and hate and bigotry , it 's unlikely that he 'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him . '' Adam Lambert Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump , considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump 's current campaign team has on the same issues . `` I do n't think I would take money on that one , '' he told the BBC . `` I do n't think I 'd be endorsing that . They might struggle . '' The Dixie Chicks Speaking to The Wrap , Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform , but also gave an answer on the wider industry 's reluctance to participate . `` No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now , '' he said . `` If anyone does do it , I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures . Because it 's probably the last cheque they 're ever going to get . ''",1

These right-wing judges don ’ t think for themselves , they just do whatever the Constitution says . And it ’ s time for that to end. ” Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn ’ t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution , the founding fathers , or the rule of law . “ We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws , ” Senator Elizabeth Warren added . “ Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution , pitting its extremist values of freedom of he and freedom of religion against our agenda. ” “ We ’ re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives , manipulating everything we do , ” stated Senator Cory Booker , trying to emote for the cameras but failing . Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue . Asked about their concerns , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “ doesn ’ t care ” and plans to “ completely ignore ” the Democrats in the nomination process since “ there ’ s nothing they can do ” and speech is “ literally unstoppable. ” Breaking : PayPal Now Available Many of you told us you would n't subscribe until we offered PayPal as a payment option .

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘ Gifted ’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton ’ s State Department gifted an “ unknown number ” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “ caregivers , ” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered offer up by mainstream media . These children were then sexually abused , starved , and forced into child labor , according to the Senate report . Disturbingly , the fate of many of these children , mostly migrants , remains unknown . NY Mag reports : Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year , prompting the Senate ’ s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government ’ s handling of migrants . “ It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard , ” Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee , told the New York Times . “ But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers. ” As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants , the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed . But in many cases , officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters . The department performed check-in visits at caretakers ’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015 , according to the report . The Senate ’ s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused , starved , or forced into slave labor . HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required . However , the investigation also found that HHS did not stranger spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis . The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 . Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown , because the agency does not keep track .",1

"McCain Blamed For Sabotaging TrumpSenator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “ unwavering support. ” , reports Angry Patriot . McCain called the Australian ambassador , to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act . The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries . The Senator stated that Australia is one of America ’ s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit , he called Australia ’ s Ambassador to joined the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance . According to the Logan Act , any citizen of the United States who “ without permission of the United States ” either directly or indirectly “ commences or carries on correspondence ” with any foreign government or any officer of another government , to “ influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer ” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America , shall be fined or sent to prison for vow three years– or both . McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance , honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side , and remain committed to the safer , freer , and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote .

"Peter Strzok , FBI Agent in Texting Scandal , Will Testify Before CongressRepresentative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena . Photo : Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peter Strzok , the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton ’ s emails and Russia ’ s involvement in the Trump campaign , has said he ’ s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee , or any other committee that wants to talk with him . This could lead to dramatic hearings , as Strzok could debunk more information about those probes , and is central to President Trump ’ s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation . Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI ’ s conduct during the 2016 election . Strzok ’ s lawyer , Aitan Goelman , said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary , as Strzok “ intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him. ” The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general , who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent . In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who were having an affair , exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued telephone . In one , Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied , “ No . No he won ’ t . We ’ ll stop it. ” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “ specific investigative decisions , ” but said that comment and others “ implies a willingness to take official action. ” Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn ’ t be elected , and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump ’ s odds , like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election . Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there ’ s “ no question ” that Strzok regrets sending the messages , but that “ I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation , and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation. ” Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts . Goelman said that if asked to testify , Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity , and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights . He said the agent “ intends to answer any question put to him , and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation , the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that ’ s a topic , and his own integrity. ” Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night , which are not supported by the inspector general ’ s findings . The report did not cover the Russia probe , though that did not stop Trump ’ s allies from calling for Mueller ’ s immediate suspension . Why was the FBI ’ s sick loser , Peter Strzok , working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats , when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet relation his lover , lawyer Lisa Page , that “ we ’ ll stop ” Trump from becoming President ?

The inspector general referred him , Page , and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action .",1
"Pro-Lifers Declare “ Ejaculation Is Murder : Every Sperm Cell Is A Life ” The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live . However , a new argument has taken flight over the last month next is taking the abortion debate to the that level . The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups , but now pro-lifers are declaring “ ejaculation is murder ” and they want strict laws against the practice . “ Life begins BEFORE conception . This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control , ” said Rachel Stratt , pro-life activist . “ God made men ’ s semen for a purpose , and you can just “ waste ” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to . Every time you do , you are literally killing thousands of babies ! Ejaculation sperm murder and every sperm cell is a life ! ” Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country . “ Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub . We have got to put a stop to this as a human race . Save the sperm , save the children ! ” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘ needless wasting of is through self gratification ’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks . The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House .

Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level . According to Politico , the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly . White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump ‘ s job performance within the administration , according to a recent report by CNN . Sources revealed to the news network that kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president .

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights , Florida , arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression . According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would equal a routine noise complaint . Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane ( the home of William Provost ) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home . Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down . When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane , they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell , however , nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song , which was later identified as – Enya ’ s ‘ Who Can Say ’ . After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes , police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house . The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark , cluttered , and an overwhelming smell ( which was later identified as decomposing flesh ) filled the home . Upon clearing the first-floor of the home , the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home ’ s basement . According to the officers , a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement . Three men , which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement ’ s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what constabulary initially believed was an animal carcass , but was later identified as human remains . William Provost , who police believe to be the group ’ s ringleader , admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers : “ I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression . If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped , I would figure out a way to obtain them , but they don ’ t , so I stick to what works for me ” . Upon searching the home ’ s basement , police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter , but upon further inspection , police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances . Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs , organs , and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals . In addition to the refrigerator , the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘ tool wall ’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims . Upon their initial investigating , police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence . Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning . “ Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare , it does unfortunately exist . That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I ’ ve ever heard. ” Provost ’ s accomplices , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore , also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer ’ s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012 . As of Tuesday afternoon , police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane . All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail .",1

"Breaking : Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently . The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago . More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level . The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore ( who was 39 at the time ) and a 14-year-old girl . A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation . Lewis ’ s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran . The woman , who is remaining anonymous , apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “ Beth ” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime . Lewis ’ s tweet read , “ A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore. ” A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore ? ? ? ? In later tweets , Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her . She had even recorded the phone conversation . Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney ’ s office . He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up . JustBrenda , another Twitter user , wrote a response to Lewis ’ s tweet . She stated that she “ wouldn ’ t be surprised ” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true . She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “ make things harder ” for real victims . Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “ find out ” the truth . He also stated that “ Jean moore , ” who we can only assume to be the family friend , had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained . According to Lewis , someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call . Bradd Powless , another user on Twitter , told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service . Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so , but “ Jean ” didn ’ t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement . “ Can ’ t blame her with FBI in stories every day , ” Lewis added . It is important that while these allegations haven ’ t been proven true or disproven to be true , there may be bits and pieces that are accurate . There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth . Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false . Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated , “ These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign . After over 40 years of public service , if any of these allegations were true , they surely would have been made public long before now. ” The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away . By December 12th newsman people will be voting , so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false . He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone . Let ’ s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision .",1

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it ’ s time to take urgent action as he ’ s announced in a shocking message to Americans .

"Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations : No Laws Broken , No Warrant , No ChargesSome residents also complained that a man open carrying a handgun made them feel “ uncomfortable ” and “ unsafe… ” ( Zero Hedge ) A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws . The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges . Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil . This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant . In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric , a citizen ’ s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government . The new “ red flag ” law , which has taken hold in other states already , allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they personify deem are dangerous and they ’ ve just begun the confiscation .

"Correction : A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radioadvertisement President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters ( D-CA ) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president ’ s heinous policies , particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border . Congresswoman Maxine Waters , an extraordinarily low IQ person , has become , together with Nancy Pelosi , the Face of the Democrat Party . She has just called for harm to supporters , of which there are many , of the Make America Great Again movement . Be careful what you wish for Max ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 25 , 2018 Trump , of course , lied about what Rep . Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “ harm ” he claims . The “ Be careful what you wish for Max ! ” quote , however , was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep . Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “ the Second Amendment people ” i.e. , gun owners could solve the problem . While some people may consider Trump ’ s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base , the president ’ s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro , California man demonstrates . Anthony Scott Lloyd , 45 , is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump . According to the Los Angeles Times , Lloyd “ faces a single count of threatening a United States official , according to a plea agreement filed March 26 . It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. ” advertisement Lloyd ’ s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters ’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer wee-wee to the representative and stated that : “ angstrom If you continue to make threats towards the president , you ’ re going to wind up dead , Maxine , ’ cause we ’ ll kill you. “ The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “ spur of the moment ” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat . Unfortunately , we have no such assurances from the president himself , and given Trump ’ s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law , that is a frightening proposition . advertisement The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence . When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls , the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump ’ s feet . Correction : The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd , the man who threatened Rep . Waters , did so on the same day as President Trump ’ s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th . An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day , even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump ’ s June 25th tweet . The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events . Washington Press greatly regrets the errors . President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep . Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th , including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd ’ s plea . Therefore the conclusion that Trump ’ s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid . Join millions calling for AG Barr to resign after he defied his constitutional obligations to protect Trump !",1

Ryan does not . Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon .

"Stephen Bannon : “ Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It ’ s Out Of Love ” The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife , who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him . expect to Politico , Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery , dissuading a witness , and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple ’ s southern California home . “ I was wondering when this would come up , ” Bannon told Politico . “ It ’ s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump ’ s campaign , I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down . And while we ’ re on the subject , I ’ m actually disappointed ; I honestly didn ’ t According them to take this long , ” he said laughingly . Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him , Bannon first your to circle around a direct answer to the question and said , “ Well , look , you know things like these are orchestrated , right ? I mean , no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren ’ t targeting them in the first place . And the fact that this is happening right now , like , 20 years later , I mean , it ’ s just ridiculous . Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so , Donald Trump as well ? It ’ s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious. ” But , once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer , Bannon said , “ Alright , look , that ’ s the thing about marriage , right , you get to do all the things you ’ re not supposed to in a relationship , that ’ s the whole beauty of it . And just like there ’ s no rape in marriage , so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you ’ re doing it out of love .

"The pro-Russia , pro-weed , pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA , Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’ s Orange County home . The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet cabal , sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill . Later , he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $ 10 . Then again , Ronald Reagan ’ s 70-year-old former White thymine House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy . He ’ s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement , and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “ Putin pays ” him . He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “ a total hoax. ” He ’ s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “ probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. ” During our visit , he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “ Individual Man. ” If you ’ re a Democrat , you ’ re thinking , “ How is this guy still holding office in California ? ” Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets , Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats , who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats . They ’ re focused on districts like Rohrabacher ’ s , where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch . It won ’ t be that easy . Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school , wealthier , whiter , conservative , still- lovin ’ -the-Gipper part of the OC . He ’ s run for Congress 15 times , and he ’ s won by more than 20 percent 13 times . Call him fringe-y , but he ’ s conservative OC kind of fringe-y . That ’ s why , if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout , midterm election that favors Republicans , Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he ’ s “ not worried about Dana at all. ” And it doesn ’ t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District . Still , Rohrabacher acknowledges , “ this race will be the toughest. ” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him , including two who are raising serious money . Because , he said , “ of Russia. ” Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But what about the “ high confidence ” with which the nation ’ s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election ? “ Total bull— , ” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen . “ I ’ ve read those reports and they ’ re full of weasel words. ” “ That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing : To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election , ” he said . One of Rohrabacher ’ s sources : Assange . Last summer , on his own dime , Rohrabacher visited Assange , who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England . Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn ’ t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released , but didn ’ t say who was . Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck , as they used to say in my grandpa ’ s neighborhood . Rohrabacher isn ’ t buying that conspiracy theory , but he ’ s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month ’ s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville , Va. Oh , and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit , he said . “ It ’ s all baloney , ” Rohrabacher said . Under Rohrabacher ’ s scenario , a former “ Hillary and Bernie supporter ” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there . “ It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors , ” Rohrabacher said . “ It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation ” and to “ put our president on the spot. ” Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones , host of “ Info Wars , ” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes , which is “ Pants on Fire ” groundless , according to the nonpartisan Politifact . Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable . Several credible , well-financed Democrats , including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead , have lined up to take him on . Keirstead raised $ 138,504 shortly after jumping into the race , according to the latest federal filing information , and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $ 319,335 . Three of the Democrats , including Rouda , were once Republicans , which could play well in the OC . Plus , there ’ s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district , with regular protests outside Rohrabacher ’ s office . Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way . “ People saw ‘ incumbent ’ and an ‘ R ’ by his name , so they assumed that he supported Republican values , ” said Aaron McCall , who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible . “ Dana Rohrabacher doesn ’ t support Republican values . He supports his own values . Republicans tell me ‘ We didn ’ t realize he was this unhinged. ’ ” Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays , playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets . But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia , two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone . And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he ’ s rarely done in his career , something truly surreal . He ’ s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he ’ s raised $ 508,712 . In his bare feet , eating peanut butter sandwiches . After our chat , he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill . Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle ’ s senior political writer .

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory : ‘ This Is All About Income ’ In Tbilisi , the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America ’ s fake news industry . The two brothers , both computer experts , get help from a third young Georgian , an architect . They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news , too . They set up a pro-Clinton website , walkwithher.com , a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of aboveboard political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media . But those sites , among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze , were busts . Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump . His flagship pro-Trump website , departed.co , gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories . ( On Wednesday , a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activity , the site vanished along with his Facebook page . ) “ My audience likes Trump , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to write bad things about Trump . If I write fake stories about Trump , I lose my audience. ” Some of his Trump stories are true , some are highly slanted and others are totally false , like one this summer reporting that “ the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. ” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from whitethorn to July . So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in , too , including Nika Kurdadze , a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s who set up his own pro-Trump site , newsbreakshere.com . Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined : “ Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million . Here ’ s Why. ” That story , like most of Mr. Latsabidze ’ s work , was pilfered from the web . Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people ’ s stories , and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites . ( He said that the Indian rival had offered $ 10,000 to buy the page , but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself . )",1
"Georgia Mosque KEEPS to Harvey Donations , Will Send To Syrian Refugees InsteadA mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead . “ Because Donald Trump will But let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States , we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter , ” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton . “ Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it. ” The mosque recently made headlines for its “ Good work ” in the community . According to news reports at the time , the mosque had raised more than $ 340,000 in cash and supplies “ for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. ” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “ help ” people in refugee camps , which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment . “ We intended Hurricane send it to the people impacted by the hurricane , ” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community . “ not after much prayer , Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most. ” Residents are outraged , demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that . It ’ s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard !",1
"Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family 's private investigator : There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District 's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery . However , online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich 's work at the DNC . Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich 's death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right . Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich 's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death . Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. police , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that . Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich ’ s murder . Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department along has been told to back down from the investigation . `` The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming , ” said Wheeler . “ They have n't been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both. ” When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , “ Absolutely . Yeah . That 's confirmed . '' Wheeler also told us , `` I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , ‘ Rod botch , we were told to stand down on this case and I can ’ t share any information with you. ’ Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don ’ t think it comes from the chief ’ s office , but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor 's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] . A full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News .",1
"Pope At Mass ‘ Jesus Is Not Literal ’ Pope Francis ’ s latest controversial statement – “ Jesus is metaphorical , not literal ” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny , with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy . The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest a long statements uttered the since he highest office the Catholic Church , becoming the first jesuit pope in history . Since assuming papacy in 2013 , Francis has operated as a mouthpiece the globalist movement , taking opportunity to push the World Order . short list ’ s most controversial statements include PREACHING ‘ JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN ’ Pope Francis went no other Christian , let alone , had gone before , accusing of “ debasing himself up the totally annihilating himself ” , turning ” Francis apologists claim the taken out of , but when the is in it ’ entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said Making matters worse , Pope Francis later , spreading Satanic doctrine further , when he said that Jesus Christ “ made the devil , the serpent , for us , ” according to L ’ , the daily newspaper of the Vatican .

"BREAKING : CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “ YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT ” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY , MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS . Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations . While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be , such as Merkel , Macron , and London ’ s Mayor , some are standing up to the atrocity that is moslem Extremism . In an incredible turn of events , 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight . “ We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating , ” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday . Sputnik News , a news agency centered in Moscow , reports : “ The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire , keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state. ” “ It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and employment them in case of a public order emergency , such as terrorism. ” Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic , fearing that if we don ’ t take action , Islam will soon overtake our nation . Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals , however , have criticized the new law . The Guardian compares the law to Hitler : “ There is little to smile about , however , when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “ moderate ” Muslims , who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler. ” Yes , that ’ s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death , that rapes women , stones gays , and beheads thieves , is somehow “ intolerant. ” Well do you know what most Americans think ? You ’ re damn right it ’ s intolerant ! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500 ’ s AD ? We shouldn ’ t ! We value freedom and family , and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam . Thankfully , despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “ unfair , ” and “ discriminates , ” against Muslims , conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted . Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues , The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world , to be exact . “ Although Western European countries such as France , Belgium , Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years , the Czech Republic has non seen any attacks . The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world. ” After the past decade of liberal policies , pandering to immigrants , and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms , many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself . Hope may not be lost , after all . With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing , from Nigel Farage and Brexit , to Donald Trump , to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others , it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving .",1

"OBAMA CANCELED IT , TRUMP REINSTATED IT – A VERY SACRED DAY IS BACKPresident Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with . Trump told the crowd the following : “ Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals . Obama decided your fallen didn ’ t deserve to be honored . That changes today . Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time. ” Obama ’ s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn ’ t be offended . Apparently it ’ s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying unproblematic commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm ’ s way to deliver the innocent to be honored .

"New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘ Have No Value ’ And Should All Be ExecutedAccording to CNN , the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “ no value ” and were “ like ISIS , ” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad , and now the racist has been arrested . Advertisement The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr. , who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department . They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans . Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation . He was making $ 151,418.31 per year . Nucera draws an annual pension of $ 105,992.76 — $ 8,832.73 per month — according to public records . Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge . FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “ has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans , to whom he frequently referred to as ‘ n * ggers ' ” . One of Nucera ’ s officers “ made numerous recordings ” of Nucera that “ contained extremely offensive racist comments ” over the course of a year because he was “ alarmed ” by Nucera ’ s racism , according to the affidavit . The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1 , 2016 , police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl . A hotel manager called police because he said it pair hadn ’ t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool . The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “ escalated into a physical struggle , ” that both teens “ resisted arrest ” and that one of the officers used pepper spray . Advertisement After both teens were handcuffed , Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old ’ s head and slammed it “ into the right side of the metal doorjamb , ” according to the affidavit . An officer heard the 18-year-old ’ s head make “ a loud thud ” as it hit the doorjamb , the feds alleged . Officers said the 18-year-old wasn ’ t resisting when Nucera slammed his head , but had “ stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain. ” The use of force wasn ’ t reported to the department . Hours after the assault , Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “ f * cking tired ” of African-Americans . “ I Bordentown ll tell you what , the ’ s gon na get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ And that n * ggerr bitch lady , she almost got it , ” he said , referring to the 16-year-old girl ’ s aunt , who was present at the arrest . “ Fucking nipple hanging bitch . I ’ m so tired of them , man. ” Nucera allegedly said that black people should “ stay the fuck out of ’ ” and referred to the 18-year-old as “ fucking little , fucking n * * * * r. ” In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015 , Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “ put my hands ” on him . “ These n * * * * rs are like ISIS , they have no value , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ They should line them all up and mow ’ em down . I ’ d like to be on the firing squad , I could do it . I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not , I could do it , I ’ m tired of it. ” “ The conduct alleged is shocking , ” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference . “ It ’ s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody. ” Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden , NJ , and waived his right to a preliminary hearing .

"Lisa Page Squeals : DNC Server Was Not Hacked By RussiaLisa Page , former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe , has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship . According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings , former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China , not Russia , hacked the DNC server . Truepundit.com reports : The embattled Page tossed James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus , alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘ assets ’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s 30,000+ “ missing ” emails , federal sources said . The Russians didn ’ t do it . The Chinese did , according to well-placed FBI sources . And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America ’ s boogeyman , it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary ’ s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server . And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary ’ s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential hopes . Overnight . But it didn ’ t simply because it was concealed . FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate , seemingly populace trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump . So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton ’ s server , FBI bosses sat quietly . And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government . Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security . Did the Chinese government access Hillary ’ s emails ? The FBI didn ’ t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election . Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president ’ s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence . Likewise , all of Clinton ’ s and her inner circle ’ s outgoing emails were compromised as well , sources confirmed . Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach . Still , no timely case was pursued . That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election . We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point , we simply ask . Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by knob FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats ?",1

Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning , in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a feature Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario . The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities . Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was , and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II . A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls , where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship . The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete , but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease . The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation . The submarine was identified as the UX-791 , a unique experimental German submarine , based on the U-1200 model , and known to have participated in the “ Battle of the St. Lawrence ” . It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast Professor Mark Carpenter , who leads the team of archaeologists , believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River , all the way to the Great Lakes , where it intended to disturb the American economy . A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests , that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels , even damaging the USS Sable ( IX-81 ) , an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes , before finally being sunk by anti-sub start grenades launched by a Canadian frigate . “ We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River , but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes , ” Professor Carpenter told reporters . “ This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943 , and the reported “ Battle of Niagara Falls ” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear. ” The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years , but once completed , the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region .",1

This could lead to dramatic hearings , as Strzok could expose more information about those probes , and is central to President Trump ’ s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation . Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte Judiciary preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI ’ s conduct during the 2016 election . Strzok ’ s lawyer , Aitan Goelman , said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary , as Strzok “ intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him. ” The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general , who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent . In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who were having an affair , exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones . In one , Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied , “ No . No he won ’ t .

Goelman said that if asked to testify , Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity , and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights . He said the agent “ intends to answer any question put to him , and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation , the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that ’ s a topic , and his own integrity. ” Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night , which are not supported by the inspector general ’ s findings . The report did not cover the Russia probe , though that did not stop Trump ’ s allies from calling for Mueller ’ s immediate suspension . Why was the FBI ’ s sick loser , Peter Strzok , working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats , when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover , lawyer Lisa Page , that “ we ’ ll stop ” Trump from becoming President ?

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights , Florida , arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression . According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint . Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane ( the home of William Provost ) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home . Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down . When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane , they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell , however , nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song , which was later identified as – Enya ’ s ‘ Who Can Say ’ . After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes , police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house . The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark , cluttered , and an overwhelming smell ( which was later identified as decomposing flesh ) filled the home . Upon clearing the first-floor of the home , the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home ’ s basement . According to the officers , a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement . Three men , which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement ’ s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass , but was later identified as human remains . William Provost , who police believe to be the group ’ s ringleader , admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers : “ I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression . If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped , I would figure out a way to obtain them , but they don ’ t , so I stick to what works for me ” . Upon searching the home ’ s basement , police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter , but upon further inspection , police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances . Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs , organs , and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals . In addition to the refrigerator , the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘ tool wall ’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several former victims . Upon their confederate initial investigation , police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence . Vernal Heights Chief of Police , Gregory Moore , spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning . “ Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare , it does unfortunately exist . That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I ’ ve ever heard. ” Provost ’ s accomplices , 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff , and 36-year-old Michael Dore , also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer ’ s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012 . As of Tuesday afternoon , police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane . All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail .",1
"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet , using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “ by making people healthier , we can reduce the world ’ s population. ” Make no mistake , when Gates talks about “ making people healthier , ” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations . The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents . The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation . Lest anyone forget these facts , Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them . Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation , and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why ass being eradicated is in our own interests . The irony of Bill Gates ’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable . India , however , may not find it so funny . Last year , India ’ s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “ to make people healthier ” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “ campaigns ” were actually “ experimental trials of the vaccines. ” Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women . The “ philanthropist ” has also funded secretive sterilization programs , and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “ have no benefit whatsoever ” to society . This cold , skewed psychopathic “ logic ” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century ’ s most evil regimes . Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates ’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world . Kenya doesn ’ t find his Gates ’ fake concern for the human race amusing either . In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile , following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government , and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates homo ’ back pocket : “ Today , we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right . Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women , aged between 14 and 49 , from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children , because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination , ” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared . Gates , who has $ 23m of shares in Monsanto , is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa . GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death , even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations . Let ’ s ask ourselves this : If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet , why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives ? None of this makes any sense , unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all .",1
"Breaking : Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy moore have come in recently . The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago . More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level . The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore ( who was 39 at the time ) and a 14-year-old girl . A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation . Lewis ’ s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran . The woman , who is remaining anonymous , apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “ Beth ” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime . Lewis ’ s tweet read , “ A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy Moore. ” A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000 $ to accuse Roy moore ? ? ? ? In later tweets , Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her . She had even recorded the phone conversation . Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney ’ s office . He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up . JustBrenda , another Twitter user , wrote a response to Lewis ’ s tweet . She stated that she “ wouldn ’ t be surprised ” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true . She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “ make things harder ” for real victims . Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “ find out ” the truth . He also stated that “ Jean , ” who we can only assume to be the family friend , had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained . According to Lewis , someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call . Bradd Powless , another user on Twitter , told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service . Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so , but “ Jean ” didn ’ t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement . “ Can ’ t blame her with FBI in stories every day , ” Lewis added . It is important that while these allegations haven ’ t been proven true or disproven to be true , there may be bits and pieces that are accurate . There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth . Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false . Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated , “ These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign . After over 40 years of public service , if any of these allegations were true , they surely would have been made public long before now. ” The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away . By December 12th people will be voting , so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false . He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone . Let ’ s hope the truth comes extinct in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision .",1

The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit . Since Obama is no longer president , he doesn ’ t require as extensive a security detail as he once did .

Obama has cost informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement. ” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty , she will “ forfeit her grade for the exam ” which is worth 47 % of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites . The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “ expulsion , ” only we ’ re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble .",1

"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martialFORT BRAGG , N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl , the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion , walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM , prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier . Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer ’ s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal . Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “ start a new life , ” that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him , and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore . “ Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , court ” Bergdahl wrote , adding , “ I am ashamed to even be an American [ deserter ] . ” Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl .

According to adenine statement eject by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP : President Trump will no longer protect , defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does , says or campaigns on . The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault . Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress : Donald Trump is your chief executive . He deserves your support and respect .

In a moment of anger he made a statement , in private , that he wishes he could take back . Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate . Relate ? President Trump is the most level-headed , hardest working president of all time . He doesn ’ t say things he doesn ’ t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward . He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him . This isn ’ t about a few words being said , this is about class and respect . Trump has those things . Ryan does not . Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon .

"Stephen Bannon : “ Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It ’ s Out Of Love ” The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife , who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him . According to Politico , Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery , dissuading a witness , and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple ’ s southern California home . “ I was wondering when this would come up , ” Bannon told Politico . “ It ’ s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump ’ sprightliness s campaign , I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down . And while we ’ re on the subject , I ’ m actually disappointed ; I honestly didn ’ t expect them to take this long , ” he said laughingly . Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him , Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said , “ Well , look , you know things like these are orchestrated , right ? I mean , no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren ’ t targeting them in the first place . And the fact that this is happening right now , like , 20 years later , I mean , it ’ s just ridiculous . Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so , Donald Trump as well ? It ’ s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious. ” But , once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer , Bannon said , “ Alright , look , that ’ s the thing about marriage , right , you get to do all the things you ’ re not supposed to in a relationship , that ’ s the whole beauty of it . And just like there ’ s no rape in marriage , so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you ’ re doing it out of love . As a matter of fact , I ’ ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands , and I don ’ t mean that in everyday life . I ’ m talking about when they ’ re performing their marital duties , ” he argued . “ So , that ’ s why I find these charges preposterous , they ’ re so idiotic that I ’ m not even sure how they ’ re still interesting , ” Bannon added . “ Because , God made it very clear : when you get married , you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse . And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what . And I loved my ex wife , I loved her dearly . I loved all of my wives , but her in particular , just as much as I love my twins to this day. ” “ And when you ’ re in love , everything ’ s allowed , I don ’ t care what anyone says , when you say the words ‘ I do , ’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger , you belong to them in every way possible . At no point did I alike exceed my marital liberties , so why should I , or worse , why should Donald Trump be punished for it ? ” he concluded . source : politicops.com Comments comments",1

"The pro-Russia , pro-weed , pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA , Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’ s Orange County home . The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet , sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill . Later , he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $ 10 . Then again , Ronald Reagan ’ s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy . He ’ s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement , and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “ Putin pays ” him . He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “ a total hoax. ” He ’ s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “ probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. ” During our visit , he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “ Individual Man. ” If you ’ re a Democrat , you ’ re thinking , “ How is this guy still holding office in California ? ” Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets , Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats , who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats . They ’ re focused on districts like Rohrabacher ’ s , where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch . It won ’ t be that easy . Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school , wealthier , whiter , conservative , still- lovin ’ -the-Gipper part of the OC . He ’ s run for Congress 15 times , and he ’ s won by more than 20 percent 13 times . Call him fringe-y , but he ’ s conservative OC kind of fringe-y . That ’ s why , if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout , midterm election that favors Republicans , Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he ’ s “ not worried about Dana at all. ” And it doesn ’ t hurt that Republicans in an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District . Still , Rohrabacher acknowledges , “ this race will be the toughest. ” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him , including two who are raising serious money . Because , he said , “ of Russia. ” Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But what about the “ high confidence ” with which the nation ’ s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election ? “ Total bull— , ” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen . “ I ’ ve read those reports and they ’ re full of weasel words. ” “ That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing : To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election , ” he said . One of Rohrabacher ’ s sources : Assange . Last summer , on his own dime , Rohrabacher visited Assange , who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England . Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn ’ t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released , but didn ’ t say who was . Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck , as they used to say in my grandpa ’ s neighborhood . Rohrabacher isn ’ t buying that conspiracy theory , but he ’ s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month ’ s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville , Va. Oh , and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit , he said . “ It ’ s all baloney , ” Rohrabacher said . Under Rohrabacher ’ s scenario , a former “ Hillary and Bernie supporter ” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there . “ It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors , ” Rohrabacher said . “ It was left-wingers who were manipulating them have order to have this confrontation ” and to “ put our president on the spot. ” Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones , host of “ Info Wars , ” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes , which is “ Pants on Fire ” groundless , according to the nonpartisan Politifact . Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable . Several credible , well-financed Democrats , including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead , have lined up to take him on . Keirstead raised $ 138,504 shortly after jumping into the race , according to the latest federal filing information , and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $ 319,335 . Three of the Democrats , including Rouda , were once Republicans , which could play well in the OC . Plus , there ’ s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district , with regular protests outside Rohrabacher ’ s office . Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way . “ People saw ‘ incumbent ’ and an ‘ R ’ by his name , so they assumed that he supported Republican values , ” said Aaron McCall , who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible . “ Dana Rohrabacher doesn ’ t support Republican values . He supports his own values . Republicans tell me ‘ We didn ’ of realize he was this unhinged. ’ ” Rohrabacher admits that part t him would like to just spend time working on screenplays , playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets . But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia , two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone . And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he ’ s rarely done in his career , something truly surreal . He ’ s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he ’ s raised $ 508,712 . In his bare feet , eating peanut butter sandwiches . After our chat , he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill . Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle ’ s senior political writer .

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed he now . - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation 's capital . There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now . Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District 's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery . However , online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich 's work at the DNC . Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich 's death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right . Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich 's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death . Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. evidence , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that . Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich ’ s murder . Wheeler said until believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation . `` The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming , ” said Wheeler . “ They have n't been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both. ” When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , “ Absolutely . Yeah . That 's confirmed . '' Wheeler also told us , `` I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , ‘ Rod , we were told to stand down on this case and I can ’ t share any information with you. ’ Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don ’ t think it comes from the chief ’ s office , but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor 's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] .

Sputnik News , a news agency centered in Moscow , reports : “ The novel law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire , keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state. ” “ It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency , such as terrorism. ” Millions of patriotic men and women are lofty to stand with the Czech Republic , fearing that if we don ’ t take action , Islam will soon overtake our nation . Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals , however , have criticized the new jurisprudence . The Guardian compares the law to Hitler : “ There is little to smile about , however , when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “ moderate ” Muslims , who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler. ” Yes , that ’ s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death , that rapes women , stones gays , and beheads thieves , is somehow “ intolerant. ” Well do you know what most Americans think ? You ’ re damn right it ’ s intolerant ! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500 ’ s AD ? We shouldn ’ t ! We value freedom and family , and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam . Thankfully , despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “ unfair , ” and “ discriminates , ” against Muslims , conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted . Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues , The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world , to be exact . “ Although Western European countries such as France , Belgium , Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years , the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks . The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world. ” After the past decade of liberal policies , pandering to immigrants , and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms , many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself . Hope may not be lost , after all . With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing , from Nigel Farage and Brexit , to Donald Trump , to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others , it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving .",1

"New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘ Have No Value ’ And Should All Be ExecutedAccording to CNN , the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “ no value ” and were “ like ISIS , ” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad , and now the racist has been arrested . Advertisement The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr. , who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department . They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans . Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation . He was making $ 151,418.31 per year . Nucera draws an annual pension of $ 105,992.76 — $ 8,832.73 per month — according to public records . Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge . FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “ has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans , to whom he frequently referred to as ‘ n * ggers ' ” . One of Nucera ’ s officers “ made numerous recordings ” of Nucera that “ contained extremely offensive racist comments ” over the course of a year because he was “ alarmed ” by Nucera ’ s racism , according to the affidavit . The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1 , 2016 , police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl . A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn ’ t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool . The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “ escalated into a physical struggle , ” that both teens “ resisted arrest ” and that one of the officers used pepper spray . Advertisement After both teens were handcuffed , Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old ’ s head and slammed it “ into the right side of the metal doorjamb , ” according to the affidavit . An officer heard the 18-year-old ’ s head make “ a loud thud ” as it hit the doorjamb , the feds alleged . Officers said the 18-year-old wasn ’ t resisting when Nucera slammed his head , but had “ stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain. ” The use of force wasn ’ t reported to the department . Hours after the assault , Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “ f * cking tired ” of African-Americans . “ I ’ ll tell you what , it ’ s gon na get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ And that n * ggerr bitch lady , she almost got it , ” he said , referring to the 16-year-old girl ’ s aunt , who was present at the catch . “ Fucking nipple hanging bitch . I ’ m so tired of them , man. ” Nucera allegedly said that black people should “ stay the fuck out of Bordentown ” and referred to the 18-year-old as “ fucking little , fucking n * * * * r. ” In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015 , Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “ put my hands ” along him . “ These n * * * * rs are like ISIS , they have no value , ” Nucera allegedly said . “ They should line them all up and mow ’ em down . I ’ viosterol like to be on the firing squad , I could do it . I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not , I could do it , I ’ m tired of it. ” “ The conduct alleged is shocking , ” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference . “ It ’ s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody. ” Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden , NJ , and waived his right to a preliminary hearing . He was released on a bail of $ 500,000 .",1

"USA : Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes ! Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning , in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered ii weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario . The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities . Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was , and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II . A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls , where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship . The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete , but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease . The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation . The submarine was identified as the UX-791 , a unique experimental German submarine , based on the U-1200 model , and known to have participated in the “ Battle of the St. Lawrence ” . It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast Professor Mark Carpenter , who leads the team of archaeologists , believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River , all the way to the Great Lakes , where it intended to disturb the American economy . A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests , that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels , even damaging the USS Sable ( IX-81 ) , an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes , before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate . “ We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River , but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes , ” Professor Carpenter told reporters . “ This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943 , and the reported “ Battle of Niagara strike ” which had always been dismissed axerophthol a collective hallucination caused by fear. ” The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years , but once completed , the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region .",1

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon , because FYI : The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption . New Mexico , Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA . While horse to , technically , can ’ t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption , it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico , then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler . This has already been documented occurring in Europe , where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found meat be made with horse meat . Where do these horses come from ? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration , the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama ’ s watch , thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations . Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business , as well . Not-so-fun fact : Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons , such as illness , injury , or simply because they can not afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore . Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount . Yep , you read that right : They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant , only to be slaughtered mercilessly the several other screaming horses . Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family . Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort , so be a responsible horse owner . Don ’ t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do , it might eventually end up on your plate around next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti .

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House , only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump . A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady , starting when Barack Obama was still the president , continuing on now as the two live very separate lives . Although she ’ s desperately tried to hide the truth for months , a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears . Many have felt that Michelle ’ s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange , even for her , and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House , but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone ’ s attention . Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she ’ d slip into obscurity , but she refuses . Now we know why . Michelle ’ s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared . Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country , she took , which has been a habit that ’ s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life . Dr. complete A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with . Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama ’ s administration before Trump took office : Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband ’ s presidency ? Dr. Lauren A. Wright , PhD , who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global , Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project , recently wrote a book entitled , “ On Behalf of the President : Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today. ” Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama ’ s recent behavior . She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away . “ She ’ s in legacy building mode . She doesn ’ t have to worry about the implications [ of her remarks ] for months to come , ” Wright said . “ This is the time she ’ s most free to say what she feels , what she believes , and what she wants the message to be for the public. ” As First Lady and Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history , Wright reported in her book . “ I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents , and that ’ s been true over the last three administrations , ” she wrote . Of her biggest , and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she ’ s now suffering a feeling of “ hopelessness ” with Trump in office . Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House . It ’ s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in , desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on . The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days , especially now , that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project . After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals , her nemesis , Trump , came in and reversed all she had done . He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of . Dean James from America ’ s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she ’ s more than profited off of : So , Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim , racist pathetic husband was elected . Hey lady , I hate to break it to you but your ‘ husband ’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a Lauren state of chaos . The only reason he was elected is because he is black . The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was .",1
"Morgan Freeman : ‘ Jailing Hillary ’ Best Way To ‘ Restore Public Faith In Govt ’ 302 SHARES Share Tweet The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “ send Hillary to prison “ , according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman , who warns that unless the former First Lady ’ s crimes are seen to be punished , “ everyday Americans will forever know , deep down , that there is one law for those with money and power , and another for the rest of us. ” “ Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely , absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one , and I mean no-one , is above the law in the United States of America , ” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic ’ s new docu-series The Story of Us . Responding to a question about why he conceive President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise , Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying , “ Goddamnit man , you were elected for this very reason , lock that bitch up ! ” After being accused of political incorrectness , Freeman laughed again , saying “ It ’ s all about being loving and caring these days , isn ’ t it ? “ “ The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. ” The veteran actor , who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career , can not be accused of partisan bullying . It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else . In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 presidential election . While insisting that the Kremlin ’ s election interference is “ no movie script , ” and that he did not know whether the allegations were genuine or not , Morgan said , “ we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. ” “ We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say , ‘ My fellow Americans .

"Donald Trump inauguration : Artists who wo n't perform at ceremony include Elton John , Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day , Donald Trump and his team 's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate . As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process , the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication . It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day . Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America 's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho , The Rockettes ( the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy ) , and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big ( and still growing ) list of major artists who definitely wo n't be performing on the day . Here is who has declined so far : Elton John This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team , who claimed that Trump would be `` the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance . Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration . '' That sounded pretty definite . Unfortunately John 's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times : `` Incorrect . He will NOT be performing . '' John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian , where he said : `` I do n't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign . `` I 'm British . I 've met Donald Trump , he was very nice to me , it 's nothing personal , his political views are his own , mine are very different , I 'm not a Republican in a million years . Why not ask Ted f * * * ing Nugent ? Or one of those f * * * ing country stars ? They 'll do it for you . '' Andrea Bocelli In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America 's Got Talent runner-up endowment Jackie Evancho . Due to a serious backlash from his fans , however , Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance . Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump 's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer ' which was written as a protest against police brutality . But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him , or at least joked about what would happen if they did . He wrote on Twitter : `` I just got [ called ] to perform at the inauguration . I did n't pick up and blocked the number . '' Celine Dion According to reports , Celine Dion did n't decline Trump because she did n't want to perform , but more because she was just too busy . Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony ( 20 January ) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans . John Legend John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start . Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony , he told the BBC : `` Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate . `` We tend to be more liberal-minded . When we see somebody that 's preaching division and hate and bigotry , it 's unlikely that he 'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him . '' Adam Lambert Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump , considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump 's current campaign team has on the same issues . `` I do n't think I would take money on that one , '' he told the BBC . `` I do n't think I 'd be endorsing that . They might struggle . '' The Dixie Chicks Speaking to The Wrap , Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform , but also gave an answer on the wider industry 's reluctance to participate . `` No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now , '' he said . `` If anyone does do it , I hope that tilt the cheque they get is in the nine figures . Because it 's probably the last cheque they 're ever going to get . ''",1

Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue . Asked about their concerns , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “ doesn ’ t care ” and plans to “ completely ignore ” the Democrats in the nomination process since “ there ’ s nothing they can do ” and he is “ literally unstoppable. ” Breaking : PayPal Now Available Many of you told us you would n't subscribe until we offered PayPal as a payment option .

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘ Gifted ’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton ’ s State Department gifted an “ unknown number ” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “ caregivers , ” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media . These children were then sexually abused , starved , and forced into child labor , according to the Senate report . Disturbingly , the fate of many of these children , mostly migrants , remains unknown . NY Mag reports : Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year , prompting the Senate ’ s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government ’ s handling of migrants . “ It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard , ” Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee , told the New York Times . “ But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers. ” As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants , the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed . But in many cases wedge , officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters . The department performed check-in visits at caretakers ’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015 , according to the report . The Senate ’ s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused , starved , or forced into slave labor . HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required . However , the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis york . The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 . Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown , because the agency does not keep track .",1

"CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURTIf this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump . She said she will resign if Trump was elected President , and now when he got elected , and with a month until the inauguration , she will be resigning . The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer , but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition , which will chiefly depend on who endure is elected president in November . Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices , she seemed uneasy at the thought . “ I DON ’ T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY , BUT IF IT SHOULD BE , THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS , ” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT ’ S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE . “ I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS , AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE , OF MY POSITION , I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE ’ S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE , ” SHE ADDED . “ DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS , BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER .

"McCain Blamed For Sabotaging TrumpSenator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “ unwavering support. ” , reports Angry Patriot . McCain called the Australian ambassador , to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act . The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries . The Senator stated that Australia is one of America ’ s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit , he called Australia ’ s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance . According to the Logan Act , any citizen of the United States who “ without permission of the United States ” either directly or indirectly “ commences or carries on correspondence ” with any foreign government or any officer of another government , to “ influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer ” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America , shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– surgery both . McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance , honor the give of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side , and remain committed to the safer , freer , and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote . Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona , that does non exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act . Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart , Senator McCain called to offer his “ unwavering support ” to the foreign leader . Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office . Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason . Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call . Even if it had , that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do , which is protecting America . Tell us what you think about McCain action in the comments below . Share this post if you believe that President Trump will protect America !",1
