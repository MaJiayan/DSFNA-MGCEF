"Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Dead, 4 Days Before His 101st BirthdayNews reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.

Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016.",1
"Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. ConstitutionSenate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.

“Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”

“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",1
"UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is AnnouncedUPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is AnnouncedAnyone else think its weird that Hillary Clinton hopped on a jet and flew to the Ukraine last night?On Friday night, Clinton was seen with her husband Bill hopping aboard an aircraft to Lviv at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.This announcement comes after speculation and rumors that one of the indictments handed down by Robert Muellers grand jury were for her.With recent news breaking that Clinton paid a Russian agency for information on Donald Trump, it is unsurprising that Mueller would target Clinton, nor is it really shocking that she would high-tail it out of the country just in case she is one of the people he is coming after on Monday.The interesting thing about the Ukraine is that the country has no extradition agreement with the United States, meaning that she can not be forced to return if indeed she is slated to be arrested Monday.This seems the likeliest scenario, former FBI agent Andrea Hawley told Fox News Saturday. Its worth noting that Hillary Clinton had no scheduled trips to the Ukraine or any reason to go there.Spokespeople for the Clintons have so far refused comment according to Fox and other news organizations.Read More: UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is Announced | Morning Herald My Thoughts:IF THEY'RE THERE...WE CAN'T TOUCH THEM...

"Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees InsteadA mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.

“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”

The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.

“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”

Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.

"Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House0

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.

“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

"Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

"USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes!Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.

The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.

A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.

The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.

The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast

Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.

A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.

“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”

The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",1
"Flight Crew Takes A Knee And Walks Off, Leaving New Orleans Saints Stranded On RunwaySHARE this story with your friends!

3.7k SHARES Share Tweet Share

The New Orleans Saints made the mistake of once again disrespecting our veterans, our country, and our flag. After an embarrassing opening to a game with the worst ratings in Saints’ history, the players and coaches learned that their actions have consequences.

Both the pilot and co-pilot of the Boeing 737 the Saints use to travel are combat-hardened American heroes. They flew sorties over Baghdad with Saddam’s best weapons firing back. They fought with their lives for your freedom and watched many of their friends die. Today they took a stand for those brave souls:

“We couldn’t be a party to the disrespect. We waited until we were cleared and last off the runway for the night , walked out of the cockpit, took a knee and deplaned. They’re not going anywhere until tomorrow.”

Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they’re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they’re told to do in the league rulebook.

"BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",1
"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism – The Newly Press News Network – POTUS Press NetworkAfter ABC cancels Roseanne Barr’s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

"McCain Blamed For Sabotaging TrumpSenator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “unwavering support.”, reports Angry Patriot.

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.

The Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.

According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.

McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.

Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his “unwavering support” to the foreign leader.

Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call. Even if it had, that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do, which is protecting America.

"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

"Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.

More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.

The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.

A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.

Lewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”

A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????

In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.

JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims.

Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.

Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.

“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.

It is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.

Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.

Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”

The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.

Let’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.",1
"Correction: A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radioadvertisement



President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.

While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.

Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”

advertisement



Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:

“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“

The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.

Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.

advertisement



The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.

When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.

Correction: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trump’s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump’s June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.

President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd’s plea. Therefore the conclusion that Trump’s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid.

"BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K VotesThe Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity has begun sending emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count in the Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones Senatorial race. RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:

Dear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can’t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian

What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.

The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘Gifted’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.

These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.

NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.

“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.

The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.

The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.

However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.

The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",1
"BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.

"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

"Mental Images — Alison JacksonMental Images

“My pictures ask where does the truth end and the lies begin…where the subjective triumphs over the objective.”

Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.

‘At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks’ says the artist ‘yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a ‘mental image’ rather than a direct record of reality’

Jackson’s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson’s productions – where the likenesses are recognisable – use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation.",1

"NASA Will Pay You $100,000 To Stay In Bed For 60 Days!Wouldn’t you just love to carry on sleeping on a Monday morning without having to submit to the Monday morning blues and get ready for work? What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!

Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.

Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.

NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.

It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.

I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.

You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!

As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.

NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.

NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:

Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.

Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.

Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.

The experiment will consist of two categories.

The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.

During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.

As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.",1
"BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",1
"BREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes ViralBREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral

A few days ago, a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama’s speech final. The topic? A World Without Whites. And now it may get Malia Obama suspended.

“White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

"Last in Queen Elizabeth II's line of corgis dies, says British pressLondon (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain's longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog's death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.

Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.

Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.

Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:

Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”

Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.

“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.

“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.

Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.

The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.

Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:

So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.

Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.

The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.",1

"BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With FalsificationSHARE this story with your friends!

1.7k SHARES Share Tweet Share

After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.

The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks to her story:

“My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing.” Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.

Moore’s attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for women’s rights.",1
"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”",1

"Mental Images — Alison JacksonMental Images

“My pictures ask where does the truth end and the lies begin…where the subjective triumphs over the objective.”

Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.

‘At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks’ says the artist ‘yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a ‘mental image’ rather than a direct record of reality’

Jackson’s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson’s productions – where the likenesses are recognisable – use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation.",1
"Last in Queen Elizabeth II's line of corgis dies, says British pressLondon (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain's longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog's death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

"Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.

More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.

The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.

A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.

Lewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”

A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????

In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.

JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims.

Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.

Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.

“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.

It is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.

Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.

Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”

The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.

Let’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.",1
"BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",1
"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARSMaxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.

Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”

Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.

Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.

On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.

While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.

Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.

Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.

Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.

Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!

"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

"Court Orders Obama To Pay $400 Million In RestitutionThe West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.

Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.

Jones wrote:

“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”

Judge Perry added:

“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”

"Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meetingFox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called ""lies"" and ""deception"" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

"Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil WarThe gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.

Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”

President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",1
"Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the CountryGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

"WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)In a last ditch effort to take down Republican Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, the mainstream media wheeled out discredited Gloria Allred accuser Beverly Young Nelson.

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” that she added “notes,” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

GMA : “Nelson says she did make notes to [Moore’s] inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.” ABC HOST: “Beverly, he did sign your yearbook.” TRENDING: BREAKING: Former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens and Friend Rush to Perform Life-Saving Measures on Shooting Victims in St. Louis! -- Eric Greitens Just Spoke with The Gateway Pundit NELSON: “He did sign it.” ABC HOST: “And you made some notes underneath?” NELSON: “Yes.”

Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it “sickens” her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017

As The Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft reported, there are growing calls that Gloria Allred and Beverly Nelson should be charged with fraud.

And in case you missed it… The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly Nelson’s press conference.

Following The Gateway Pundit’s viral story on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Strangely, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is written in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin. Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud.",1
"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARSMaxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.

Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”

Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.

Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.

On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.

While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.

Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.

Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.

Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.

Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!

"Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees InsteadA mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.

“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”

The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.

“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”

Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.

"Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

"OBAMA CANCELED IT, TRUMP REINSTATED IT – A VERY SACRED DAY IS BACKPresident Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.

Trump told the crowd the following: “Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”

Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.

President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.

They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.

But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.

So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.

Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",1

"BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower WiretapFormer president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:

“The proof is undeniable.

Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.”

The call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama’s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will",1

"Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His ‘Murder Trump’ VideoSnoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video “Lavender,” in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:

“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.

"CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ FaceOn Sunday, CNN did something shocking: they took accountability for the actions of a member of their staff and kicked him to the curb over his remarks about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

"BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.

"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martialFORT BRAGG, N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier.

Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal.

Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “start a new life,” that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him, and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore.

“Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others,” Bergdahl wrote, adding, “I am ashamed to even be an American [deserter].”

Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl.

Staff Sgt. Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

"Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the CountryGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism – The Newly Press News Network – POTUS Press NetworkAfter ABC cancels Roseanne Barr’s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

"Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His ‘Murder Trump’ VideoSnoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video “Lavender,” in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:

“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.

"Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil WarThe gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.

Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”

President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

"Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be “Punished” with Gay ChildDonald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. If you doubt that Donald Trump is God’s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:

“It’s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he’s not. And we know that he’s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That’s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don’t choose them.”

“All we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they’ve been chosen and know that that’s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children’s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert’s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.”

Copeland appeared on Colbert’s “Pray for America” call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.

"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1
"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton OperativesAnthony Bourdain had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead in an apparent “suicide.”

According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death.

His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.

Bourdain was fierce critic of Harvey Weinstein and denounced the serial sexual abuser, calling for swift justice to be served.

During his condemnation of Weinstein, he publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had full knowledge of the sexual abuse, and had done so “for years”:

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

..and I am in no way an HRC fan. I’ve been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun, — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead … mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. Spade hung herself as well, NYPD officials said. Are Spade’s and Bourdain’s deaths both coincidences?

Newmediacentral.net reports: Back in October of 2017, CNN’s Bourdain made statements regarding Harvey Weinstein, suggesting Hillary Clinton had to know of his history of being a sexual predator. Bourdain’s girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.

know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.” Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.

"Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”

“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”

He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”

“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",1
"Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House — And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!It’s been a rough day for Trump’s extended family as White House adviser Jared Kushner‘s has officially had his security clearance downgraded from Top Secret to the Secret level, a major sign of disrespect to the young adviser.

Kushner, who is President Trump’s son-in-law, will no longer be able to access top-secret intelligence, Politico confirmed, noting three sources close to the situation.

Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level.

According to Politico, the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly.

White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump‘s job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN.

Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president.

Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is “playing government,” while branding her child tax credit as “a pet project.”

The shocking report comes after Trump’s trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly.

“This isn’t like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex,” a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.

Kelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter’s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.

"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

"BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT” – US PATRIOTSWITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",1

I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.

Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.

Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.

Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:

Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”

Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.

“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.

“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.

Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.

The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.

Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:

So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.

Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.

The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.",1
"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1
"WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)In a last ditch effort to take down Republican Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, the mainstream media wheeled out discredited Gloria Allred accuser Beverly Young Nelson.

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” that she added “notes,” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

GMA : “Nelson says she did make notes to [Moore’s] inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.” ABC HOST: “Beverly, he did sign your yearbook.” TRENDING: BREAKING: Former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens and Friend Rush to Perform Life-Saving Measures on Shooting Victims in St. Louis! -- Eric Greitens Just Spoke with The Gateway Pundit NELSON: “He did sign it.” ABC HOST: “And you made some notes underneath?” NELSON: “Yes.”

Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it “sickens” her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017

As The Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft reported, there are growing calls that Gloria Allred and Beverly Nelson should be charged with fraud.

And in case you missed it… The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly Nelson’s press conference.

Following The Gateway Pundit’s viral story on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Strangely, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is written in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin. Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud.",1
"Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. ConstitutionSenate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.

“Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”

“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”

"Computer Models Show IRMA Destroying New York City On Sept. 10All 5 Boroughs of New York City and most of New Jersey could be totally destroyed on September 10 by Hurricane IRMA, according to computer simulations.

By 12:00 noon on September 10, computer models show that the strength and path of IRMA risk totally obliterating New York.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service, and its National Hurricane Center utilize supercomputers to predict where hurricanes will travel based on hundreds-of-thousands of pieces of weather data. The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH.

I am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong. Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong.

But if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days.

I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “in excess of 157 MPH.”

I doubt my condo complex could withstand it. I cannot even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load. I suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over.

Even buildings which don’t simply blow over, would probably see ALL their windows blown out.

Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly!

In all of recorded history, no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be beyond “catastrophic.” Seems to me, there would be NOTHING left!

I emphasize that I know computer “models” are just that: MODELS. They may be very wrong.

But given the specificity of this particular forecast, I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day. If it appears as you see in the model video below, then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ.

No one would be able to survive this type of storm.

Here now, the GFS Model which was issued by the National Weather Service at 2:00 PM EDT on Friday, September 1, 2017:",1

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.

They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.

But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.

So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.

Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",1
"UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is AnnouncedUPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is AnnouncedAnyone else think its weird that Hillary Clinton hopped on a jet and flew to the Ukraine last night?On Friday night, Clinton was seen with her husband Bill hopping aboard an aircraft to Lviv at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.This announcement comes after speculation and rumors that one of the indictments handed down by Robert Muellers grand jury were for her.With recent news breaking that Clinton paid a Russian agency for information on Donald Trump, it is unsurprising that Mueller would target Clinton, nor is it really shocking that she would high-tail it out of the country just in case she is one of the people he is coming after on Monday.The interesting thing about the Ukraine is that the country has no extradition agreement with the United States, meaning that she can not be forced to return if indeed she is slated to be arrested Monday.This seems the likeliest scenario, former FBI agent Andrea Hawley told Fox News Saturday. Its worth noting that Hillary Clinton had no scheduled trips to the Ukraine or any reason to go there.Spokespeople for the Clintons have so far refused comment according to Fox and other news organizations.Read More: UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is Announced | Morning Herald My Thoughts:IF THEY'RE THERE...WE CAN'T TOUCH THEM...

"Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meetingFox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called ""lies"" and ""deception"" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”",1

"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton OperativesAnthony Bourdain had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead in an apparent “suicide.”

According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death.

His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.

Bourdain was fierce critic of Harvey Weinstein and denounced the serial sexual abuser, calling for swift justice to be served.

During his condemnation of Weinstein, he publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had full knowledge of the sexual abuse, and had done so “for years”:

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

..and I am in no way an HRC fan. I’ve been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun, — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead … mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. Spade hung herself as well, NYPD officials said. Are Spade’s and Bourdain’s deaths both coincidences?

Newmediacentral.net reports: Back in October of 2017, CNN’s Bourdain made statements regarding Harvey Weinstein, suggesting Hillary Clinton had to know of his history of being a sexual predator. Bourdain’s girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.

know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.” Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.

"Pro-Lifers Declare “Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life”The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.

“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”

Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.",1

"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

The New Orleans Saints made the mistake of once again disrespecting our veterans, our country, and our flag. After an embarrassing opening to a game with the worst ratings in Saints’ history, the players and coaches learned that their actions have consequences.

Both the pilot and co-pilot of the Boeing 737 the Saints use to travel are combat-hardened American heroes. They flew sorties over Baghdad with Saddam’s best weapons firing back. They fought with their lives for your freedom and watched many of their friends die. Today they took a stand for those brave souls:

“We couldn’t be a party to the disrespect. We waited until we were cleared and last off the runway for the night , walked out of the cockpit, took a knee and deplaned. They’re not going anywhere until tomorrow.”

Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they’re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they’re told to do in the league rulebook.

"Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His ‘Murder Trump’ VideoSnoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video “Lavender,” in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:

“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.

"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",1
"Lisa Page Squeals: DNC Server Was Not Hacked By RussiaLisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.

According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.

Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.

The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.

And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.

And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.

FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.

And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.

Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.

Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.

That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.

We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.

Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",1
"NASA Will Pay You $100,000 To Stay In Bed For 60 Days!Wouldn’t you just love to carry on sleeping on a Monday morning without having to submit to the Monday morning blues and get ready for work? What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!

Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.

Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.

NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.

It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.

I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.

You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!

As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.

NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.

NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:

Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.

Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.

Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.

The experiment will consist of two categories.

The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.

During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.

As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.",1
"Nancy Pelosi Suffers Breakdown, Taken From Capitol Hill On A StretcherIt’s not a good day for Democrats.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a “breakdown” this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda. Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:

“Mrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”

Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton OperativesAnthony Bourdain had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead in an apparent “suicide.”

According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death.

His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.

Bourdain was fierce critic of Harvey Weinstein and denounced the serial sexual abuser, calling for swift justice to be served.

During his condemnation of Weinstein, he publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had full knowledge of the sexual abuse, and had done so “for years”:

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

..and I am in no way an HRC fan. I’ve been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun, — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead … mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. Spade hung herself as well, NYPD officials said. Are Spade’s and Bourdain’s deaths both coincidences?

Newmediacentral.net reports: Back in October of 2017, CNN’s Bourdain made statements regarding Harvey Weinstein, suggesting Hillary Clinton had to know of his history of being a sexual predator. Bourdain’s girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.

know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.” Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.

"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

"Pro-Lifers Declare “Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life”The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.

“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”

Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.",1

"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”",1
"Oscar Pistorius Attempts To Commit SuicideThe former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.

Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.

Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.

“An inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally,” the news report stated.

The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.

The reports could not yet be confirmed.

Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.

The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.

"BREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes ViralBREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral

A few days ago, a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama’s speech final. The topic? A World Without Whites. And now it may get Malia Obama suspended.

“White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “expulsion,” but we’re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble.",1
"Obama, Not Donald Trump, May Be Invited to Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleThe guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.

But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.

Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.

If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.

Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.

As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.

“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.

Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”

Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.",1
"Court Orders Obama To Pay $400 Million In RestitutionThe West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.

Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.

Jones wrote:

“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”

Judge Perry added:

“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”

"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before CongressRepresentative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”

Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.

Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”

Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.

Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",1
"CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ FaceOn Sunday, CNN did something shocking: they took accountability for the actions of a member of their staff and kicked him to the curb over his remarks about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

While this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn’t full of lies and misinformation, it’s good to see them do the right thing for once.",1

"Lisa Page Squeals: DNC Server Was Not Hacked By RussiaLisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.

According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.

Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.

The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.

And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.

And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.

FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.

And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.

Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.

Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.

That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.

We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.

Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",1
"BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower WiretapFormer president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest.

That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will",1
"The pro-Russia, pro-weed, pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.

Then again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”

He’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”

If you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”

Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.

It won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.

That’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.

Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”

Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?

“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”

“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.

One of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.

Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.

Rohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.

“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.

Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.

“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”

Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.

Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.

Plus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.

“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”

Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.

But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.

And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘Gifted’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.

These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.

NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.

“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.

The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.

The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.

However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.

The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",1
"Nancy Pelosi Suffers Breakdown, Taken From Capitol Hill On A StretcherIt’s not a good day for Democrats.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a “breakdown” this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda.

She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”

Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

"Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be “Punished” with Gay ChildDonald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. If you doubt that Donald Trump is God’s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:

“It’s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he’s not. And we know that he’s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That’s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don’t choose them.”

“All we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they’ve been chosen and know that that’s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children’s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert’s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.”

Copeland appeared on Colbert’s “Pray for America” call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.

"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All BookWashington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”





Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”





Berman: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”

Berman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking?

Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.”

"Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to deathFamily's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death [ ] Hide Caption [ ] Show Caption Seth Rich Local News Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘Gifted’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.

These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.

NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.

“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.

The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.

The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.

However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.

The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",1
"BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.

"OBAMA CANCELED IT, TRUMP REINSTATED IT – A VERY SACRED DAY IS BACKPresident Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.

Trump told the crowd the following: “Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”

Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.

President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.

"Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. ConstitutionSenate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.

“Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”

“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”

"Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No ChargesSome residents also complained that a man open carrying a handgun made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe…”

(Zero Hedge) A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.

This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.

The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities.

** MORE GUN CONFISCATION COVERAGE at Liberty Headlines **

Neighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law. Other residents also complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe.”

“He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic,” said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the gun owner and a person without any reasonable gun knowledge. Handguns are semi-automatic…

"Obama, Not Donald Trump, May Be Invited to Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleThe guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.

But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.

Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.

If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.

Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.

As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.

“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.

Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”

Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire.",1
"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

"BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower WiretapFormer president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:

“The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.” “The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.”

The call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama’s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will",1
"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.

Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.

Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.

Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:

Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”

Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.

“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.

“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.

Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.

The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.

Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:

So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.

Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.

The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.",1
"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All BookWashington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”





Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”





Berman: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags.

"Correction: A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radioadvertisement



President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.

While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.

Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”

advertisement



Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:

“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“

The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.

Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.

advertisement



The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.

When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.

Correction: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trump’s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump’s June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.

President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd’s plea. Therefore the conclusion that Trump’s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid.

"BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired’Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:

President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.

Ryan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:

Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.

Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.

This isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:

“Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”

And that, as they say, is that.",1
"BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower WiretapFormer president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:

"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martialFORT BRAGG, N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier.

Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal.

Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “start a new life,” that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him, and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore.

“Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others,” Bergdahl wrote, adding, “I am ashamed to even be an American [deserter].”

Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl.

Staff Sgt. Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort.

ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified.

Pentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahl’s whereabouts: $25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information.

Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years.",1

After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.

The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks to her story:

“My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing.” Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.

"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1
"Last in Queen Elizabeth II's line of corgis dies, says British pressLondon (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain's longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog's death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

"Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”

“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”

He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”

“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",1
"USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes!Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.

The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.

A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.

The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.

The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast

Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.

A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.

“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”

The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",1
"Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be “Punished” with Gay ChildDonald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. If you doubt that Donald Trump is God’s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:

“It’s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he’s not. And we know that he’s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That’s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don’t choose them.”

“All we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they’ve been chosen and know that that’s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children’s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert’s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.”

Copeland appeared on Colbert’s “Pray for America” call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’302 SHARES Share Tweet

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”",1
"Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil WarThe gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.

Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”

President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

"Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

Elton John

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

Andrea Bocelli

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.""",1
"Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees InsteadA mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.

“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”

The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.

“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”

Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.

It’s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard!",1
"New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘Have No Value’ And Should All Be ExecutedAccording to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.

The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.

Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.

Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.

The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.

After both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.

Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.

“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”

Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”

In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.

“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”

“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.

“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”

Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.",1
"Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee. Do you support to deport them?A highly regarded Texas law enforcement officer was shot and killed Monday moments after arriving for work in an attack that prompted a massive manhunt for the gunman.

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

“Whether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just don’t know that right now,” Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still “actively investigating” the shooting.",1
"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism – The Newly Press News Network – POTUS Press NetworkAfter ABC cancels Roseanne Barr’s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

"CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ FaceOn Sunday, CNN did something shocking: they took accountability for the actions of a member of their staff and kicked him to the curb over his remarks about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

While this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn’t full of lies and misinformation, it’s good to see them do the right thing for once.",1
"Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”

“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”

He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”

“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",1
"Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and DepressionPolice in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",1
"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before CongressRepresentative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”

Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.

Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”

Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.

Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",1
"Man pardoned by Obama ‘executed’ by masked men at halfway houseSAGINAW, Mich. — A man recently pardoned by former President Barack Obama was shot and killed by two men with assault-style rifles.

It happened at 9:40 p.m. on Jan. 23, at Bannum Place Federal Corrections Halfway House in Saginaw.

Michigan State Police spokesperson Lt. David Kaiser told WNEM the two masked men barged into the building and shot 31-year-old Demarlon Thomas of Saginaw.

He was shot multiple times by one of the gunmen, while the other held roughly two dozen others at the home at gunpoint. Thomas died at the scene.

“One person watched over a group of them while another subject located the victim and executed him,” Kaiser told MLive.com. “They were looking for this person.”

The two suspects then fled the area. No one else was injured.

It wasn’t immediately known how long Thomas had been out of prison and living in the halfway house.

Thomas was a former Sunny Side Gang member, according to Kaiser. He was busted in one of the biggest drug busts in Saginaw, known as “Operation Sunset.”

In 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison for the distribution of five grams or more of cocaine. The operation effectively ended the Sunny Side Gang.

Thomas was among the 79 people pardoned on Nov. 22 by former President Obama.

His jail sentence was set to expire in March.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",1
"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism – The Newly Press News Network – POTUS Press NetworkAfter ABC cancels Roseanne Barr’s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

"CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURTIf this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.

She said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.

The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.

“I DON’T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT’S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.

“I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE, OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,” SHE ADDED.

“DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS, I DON’T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE, AND THAT’S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY.”

AFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GINSBERG TURNED TO HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

“THERE’S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SO I’M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT – I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS. I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. I CAN TOLERATE THIS CHARADE OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT I COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT,” SHE SAID.

“I AM A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I HAD A PROSPEROUS AND FULFILLED LIFE,” JUSTICE GINSBERG ARGUED.

However, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when I’m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower.",1
"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All BookWashington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”





Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”





Berman: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”

Berman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking?

Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.”

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

"Computer Models Show IRMA Destroying New York City On Sept. 10All 5 Boroughs of New York City and most of New Jersey could be totally destroyed on September 10 by Hurricane IRMA, according to computer simulations.

By 12:00 noon on September 10, computer models show that the strength and path of IRMA risk totally obliterating New York.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service, and its National Hurricane Center utilize supercomputers to predict where hurricanes will travel based on hundreds-of-thousands of pieces of weather data. The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH.

I am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong. Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong.

But if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days.

I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “in excess of 157 MPH.”

I doubt my condo complex could withstand it. I cannot even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load. I suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over.

Even buildings which don’t simply blow over, would probably see ALL their windows blown out.

Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly!

In all of recorded history, no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be beyond “catastrophic.” Seems to me, there would be NOTHING left!

I emphasize that I know computer “models” are just that: MODELS. They may be very wrong.

But given the specificity of this particular forecast, I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day. If it appears as you see in the model video below, then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ.

No one would be able to survive this type of storm.

"Senate Report Admits Clinton ‘Gifted’ Children To Human TraffickersHillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.

These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.

NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.

“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.

The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.

The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.

However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.

The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",1

"TRUMP WANTS TO DEPORT AMERICAN INDIANS TO INDIAWashington (dpo) – As part of his plan to improve national security and combat illegal immigration, US President Donald Trump intends to send around 3 million American Indians back to where they came from – India. He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.

In an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”

President Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”

Further criticism is to be found on the President’s Twitter account:

He also tweeted:

The White House has announced that Indians will be given a three month period in which to leave the country. India is to pay for their flights.

"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1

"Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

Elton John

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

Andrea Bocelli

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.""",1
"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

"Thousands killed as Israel Drops Tactical Nuclear Bomb On SyriaAn Israeli airplane in Syria has dropped the first nuclear bomb deployed in armed conflict since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to local reports.

The nuclear blast targeted an ammunitions depot in Hama, Syria and was so powerful it caused a 2.6 magnitude earthquake recorded close to Taqsees, Hama, Syria at 10:40 pm local time Sunday, at the same time Syrian TV reported several explosions in the same area.

"Court Orders Obama To Pay $400 Million In RestitutionThe West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.

Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.

Jones wrote:

“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”

Judge Perry added:

“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”

"Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.

They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.

But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.

So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.

Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",1
"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism – The Newly Press News Network – POTUS Press NetworkAfter ABC cancels Roseanne Barr’s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the rescue.

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

"The pro-Russia, pro-weed, pro-Assange GOP congressman who will be tough to beatCOSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.

Then again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”

He’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”

If you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”

Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.

It won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.

That’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.

Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”

Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?

“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”

“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.

One of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.

Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.

Rohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.

“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.

Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.

“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”

Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.

Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.

Plus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.

“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”

Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.

But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.

And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.

"BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With FalsificationSHARE this story with your friends!

1.7k SHARES Share Tweet Share

After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.

The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks to her story:

“My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing.” Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.

Moore’s attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for women’s rights.",1
"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employeesA South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

"BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.

"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton OperativesAnthony Bourdain had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead in an apparent “suicide.”

According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death.

His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.

Bourdain was fierce critic of Harvey Weinstein and denounced the serial sexual abuser, calling for swift justice to be served.

During his condemnation of Weinstein, he publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had full knowledge of the sexual abuse, and had done so “for years”:

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

..and I am in no way an HRC fan. I’ve been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun, — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead … mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. Spade hung herself as well, NYPD officials said. Are Spade’s and Bourdain’s deaths both coincidences?

Newmediacentral.net reports: Back in October of 2017, CNN’s Bourdain made statements regarding Harvey Weinstein, suggesting Hillary Clinton had to know of his history of being a sexual predator. Bourdain’s girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.

know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.” Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead…mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself.

"BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K VotesThe Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity has begun sending emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count in the Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones Senatorial race. RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:

Dear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can’t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian

What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.

The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

"Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of MisconductAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.

More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.

The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.

A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.

Lewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”

A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????

In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.

JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims.

Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.

Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.

“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.

It is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.

Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.

Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”

The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.

Let’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.",1

"TRUMP WANTS TO DEPORT AMERICAN INDIANS TO INDIAWashington (dpo) – As part of his plan to improve national security and combat illegal immigration, US President Donald Trump intends to send around 3 million American Indians back to where they came from – India. He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.

In an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”

President Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”

Further criticism is to be found on the President’s Twitter account:

He also tweeted:

The White House has announced that Indians will be given a three month period in which to leave the country. India is to pay for their flights.

"Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John LegendWith only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

Elton John

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

Andrea Bocelli

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.""",1
"Pro-Lifers Declare “Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life”The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.

“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”

Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.",1
"CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ FaceOn Sunday, CNN did something shocking: they took accountability for the actions of a member of their staff and kicked him to the curb over his remarks about Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

While this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn’t full of lies and misinformation, it’s good to see them do the right thing for once.",1

"BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower WiretapFormer president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

"Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil WarThe gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.

Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”

President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

"Nancy Pelosi Suffers Breakdown, Taken From Capitol Hill On A StretcherIt’s not a good day for Democrats.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a “breakdown” this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda. Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:

“Mrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”

Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

"Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meetingFox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called ""lies"" and ""deception"" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionUSDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

"Oscar Pistorius Attempts To Commit SuicideThe former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.

Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.

Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.

“An inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally,” the news report stated.

The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.

Loading...

The reports could not yet be confirmed.

Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.

The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.

"MITT ROMNEY: ‘TRUMP HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, HE MUST RESIGN BEFORE WE…’AMID AN INTERVIEW ON CNN’S “AC360,” FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY URGED PRESIDENT TRUMP TO LEAVE OFFICE OVER THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS AGAINST HIM AND COMMENTED THAT THE PRESIDENT “HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.”

Romney shared his opinion on Trump’s controversial tweets by sayin:

“I think you’ve got a president who has some very serious emotional problems.”

“I’m especially concerned about his constant tweets about North Korea. It’s already bad and he is adding fuel to the fire.”

Romney added, “You’ve got a president who has been accused, by many, many women of harassment, to say the least. This is a guy who was on a tape seen by everybody in America essentially bragging about his sexual assault of women.”

“Do I think under those considerations of Al Franken resigned, do I think the president should resign? I do. Do I think he will? I don’t. But, yes, I do think he should resign.”

Romney continued, “Let me take it a little step further. We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he’s assaulted women, so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what’s going on and also think about resigning. But if your point is it is not just Al Franken you are absolutely right.”

"Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”

“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”

He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”

“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.",1

"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The PlanetBill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1
"Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the CountryGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

""Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself.""",1
"Twelve More Hurricanes Headed Towards USThe amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle beginning in 2018 If you are caught speeding, the amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle. The more expensive the vehicle, the more expensive the fine will be. The photographs taken by radars will be able to determine the model of the car, motorcycle, or truck. The cheapest vehicles will be fined lightly, whereas high-end vehicles will face much heavier fines. This measure acknowledges the inequality between those “who can afford” to pay the fines and those who “suffer” under the repressive system. Thus, the wallets of the most well-to-do will be hit just as hard as those of the most humble. The measure promises to reduce delinquency on the road by the wealthy, thus eliminating the feeling of impunity shared among more and more drivers.",1

"New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘Have No Value’ And Should All Be ExecutedAccording to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.

The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.

Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.

Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.

The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.

After both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.

Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.

“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”

Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”

In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.

“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”

“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.

“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”

Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.",1

"BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrumpThe Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.
