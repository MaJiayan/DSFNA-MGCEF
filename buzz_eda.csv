"Charlotte riots have gone mad . The idiots there turned a “ peaceful protest ” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun . Go figure . They can ’ t even play the race card on this one , but they ’ ll still wreck a town for no reason . It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction . What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted ? Nothing . But thugs wan na be thugs , so this is what they do . Rather than get a job and start a family , these losers knock up overweight women , make multuple kids , avoid childsupport payments like the plague , and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police . Ding ding ! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless , no-daddy , thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence . Why ? Because another black man was an idiot who didn ’ t listen to police . That must mean it ’ s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot , loot , and belike lynch white people . These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter . The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don ’ t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug . Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man ’ s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention . While they were addressing this situation , the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another . It ’ s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man , but mt for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation , all hell breaks loose . This proves that they don ’ t know what they are rioting for , because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do , they wouldn ’ t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed . If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured , then I ’ d probably pick them up . I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they ’ d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up . Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community . They ’ re the extremely violent thugs of America who , in between beating innocent people , also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses . Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America . They ’ re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association . They call white people racist just because they ’ re white . They attack people just because they ’ re white . They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment . How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin ? They can ’ t . But as we grow , we learn how to control our body , emotions , thoughts , and actions . I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin . Based off what I ’ ve seen so far , I can proudly say F * ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on .",1
"Donald Trump , the supposed “ law and regularise ” candidate , painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “ inner cities ” was like . “ We have a situation where we have inner cities , African-Americans , Hispanics are living in hell because it ’ s so dangerous ” said the Republican candidate a few hours sooner . He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ’ s unconstitutional and discriminatory “ stop-and-frisk ” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers . But his account didn ’ t match up with the facts , and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn ’ t good at their jobs . The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD , J. Peter Donald , fact-checked Trump during the debate , and has this to say about the racist Republican ’ s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011 : Trump is trying to position himself as “ tough on crime ” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers . Not only was “ stop-and-frisk ” ineffective , it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended , crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques . Trump is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn ’ t exist – and the policemen whose support he ’ s courting aren ’ t buying it either .",1
"Soros believes that he is God and that he controls America ! Interesting opinion as he is an atheist ! Well , he has been doing a pretty good job at trying to control America and that is FOR SURE ! AmericanToday reports : George Soros claims he is a god and “ the creator of everything , ” however the billionaire globalist also warns he is a “ self-centred ” god who believes “ normal rules do not apply ” to him . “ I fancied myself as some kind of god … ” he wrote . “ If truth be known , I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood , which I felt I had to control , otherwise they might get me in trouble. “ When asked by Britain ’ s Independent newspaper to elaborate on that statement , Soros doubled down : “ It is a sort impoverishment of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god , the creator of everything , but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out. “ “ Next to my fantasies about being God , I also have very strong fantasies of being mad , ” Soros once confided on British television . “ In fact , my grandfather was actually paranoid . I have a lot of madness in my family . So far I have escaped it. ” Soros has made his wealth on the backs of millions in poverty , yet he is the king of decrying how unfair America is because of its greatness . He has , in fact , created more poverty around the world than he could ever complain about ! Why doesn ’ t he just give away his money to the idol poor , and live as he would like others to live ? Because he is just another far left hypocrite who cares about no one except George Soros . Ugly he is , on the inside and out ! It is OK ! Someday George , you WILL know who God is ! Philippians 2:9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name , 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of those in heaven , and of those on earth , and of those under the earth , 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .",1
"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah ’ s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election . Last week , during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation ’ s annual conference , Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US ” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency . “ I froze , ” Brennan said . “ This was back in 1980 , and I thought back to a previous election where I voted , and I voted for the Communist Party candidate. ” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech , he said he decided to answer truthfully . “ We ’ ve all had indiscretions in our past , ” he said . “ I would not be up here if that was disqualifying. ” “ I froze , because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said , ‘ OK , here ’ s the choice , John . You can deny that , and the machine is probably going to go , you know , wacko , or I can acknowledge it and see what happens , ' ” Brennan said . The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act , which “ prohibit [ ed ] certain subversive activities , ” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence . Thus the question that is routinely asked is , “ Have you EVER advocated ( either directly or indirectly ) the overthrow of any government by force or violence ? ” “ I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican , but it was my way , as I was going to college , of signaling my unhappiness with the system , and the need for change , ” Bennan added . “ I said I ’ m not a member of the Communist Party , so the polygrapher looked at me and said , ‘ OK , ’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said , ‘ Well , I ’ m screwed . ' ” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating , “ So if back in 1980 , John Brennan was allowed to say , ‘ I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall ’ … and still got through , rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that ’ s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government. ” It ’ s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi , wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress , but kept it classified , is known as a bully , and has continued to help aid America ’ s enemies in the Middle East . We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible , but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history . Between 1950 and 1957 , many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism . According to Wikipedia : After a ten-month trial at the Foley bespeak Square Courthouse in Manhattan , eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949 . [ 50 ] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $ 10,000 fines . An eleventh defendant , Robert G. Thompson , a distinguished hero of the Second World War , was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record . The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . Those convicted appealed the verdicts , and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision . Following that decision , the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases . In total , by May 1956 , another 131 communists were indicted , of whom 98 were convicted , nine acquitted , while juries brought no verdict in the other cases . [ 51 ] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , a founding member of the ACLU . However , June 17 , 1957 , Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “ distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept. ” However , consider that that new Cold War , which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us , is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan , Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power ? And do you really think they are not out to silence your opposition to you ? If you do , then you are a part of the problem .

"This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative . Anything with ‘ Clinton ’ in it has to be corrupt , but this resulted in the deaths of many , many Africans . They distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients , virtually sentencing them to dying . An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is , did the Clintons know about it . I ’ m betting that they did . Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce . The DOJ also levied a $ 500 million fine and forfeiture against the company . So , one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this . “ This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland , and the nation ’ s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company , ” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty . From The Daily Caller : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation . The congressional report , titled , “ The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story , ” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn , a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative . The congressional report focused on Clinton ’ s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy , which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries . It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur , a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower , permitting the U.S. government to plunge a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm . The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market . Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce . “ The question becomes , ‘ how many people lost their lives , how many people found it was a false promise , ’ ” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF . This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves . Right when they need it least . A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC . What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation ’ s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “ watered-down ” drugs . But that it happened at all , surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous . All for money . ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone , the US Agency for International Development allocated $ 9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “ more than $ 1.8 million packages. ” “ Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients , perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infection , ” Roger Bate , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines , told the DCNF . Ranbaxy ’ s generic drugs are banned in the US , but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide . The Clinton Foundation and Clinton ’ s charity have not severed ties with them either . Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money . Corruption is rampant . Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary .",1

"Hillary Clinton , former , Secretary of State , has stuck to her story that she handed over all of her work-related emails . Even though , she wiped her computer with the equivalent of electronic bleach , not a simple cloth , yeah…she has absolutely nothing to hide ! The best part , Hillary holds fast to her claim , even as new batches of emails are recovered . Emails , that were not included in her alleged “ complete ” batch , she ’ d originally turned over . Now , 30 emails that had been previously wiped off the face of the earth , were recovered . Unfortunately for Hillary , they were related to Benghazi , but she knew that didn ’ t she ? FBI investigators recovered 30 emails from Hillary Clintonâs wiped server which discussed Benghazi , government lawyers said in federal court on Tuesday . The disclosure was made during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta in a case involving a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group Judicial Watch . Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State . The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the Of and redact potentially classified information before they are released . Government lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that some of the emails recovered by FBI investigators from her email server contained âsearch termsâ related to Benghazi . Clinton gave the State Department more than 30,000 of her work-related emails in Dec. 2014 . emails good , the State Department released 296 emails related to Benghazi and Libya . The agency asserted that those were all of the Clinton emails it had pertaining to Benghazi . But in September , the State Department discovered another 925 Benghazi-related emails . Those were handed over to the House Select Committee on Benghazi . But it was revealed last month that Clinton deleted âseveral thousandâ work-related emails from her server . Do they really need a full day to prepare per email that was recovered ? Must be some pretty those stuff in there… Hmmm",1
"I watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today . The shooting in Tulsa , where I live , is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man . Not quite . Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long . He had been arrested at least 12 times previously . They found PCP in his stalled SUV . What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised . He was indeed unarmed , but as you will see in the video below , he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police . He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something . That is when a white , female officer shot him fatally . His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot . Two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun . It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up . From my viewpoint , the officer followed procedure . Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy ? No , that is not how they are trained . The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me . Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again . Originally , people said he was a pastor… not true , he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort . Now , onto North Carolina , where the black man was armed , shot and killed as well… by a black police officer . From Gateway Pundit : Protests erupted in Charlotte , North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer . The man was reportedly shot by a black officer . Protesters attacked police , hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser . The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte . According to WBTV , officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm . Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle was armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject. ” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting . They ’ re hurling water bottles at police . Twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte . His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven , reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed . That ’ s touching , but it ’ s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa , I ’ m far more willing to department the police here than BLM . According to officers , they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car . They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car . He got out with a gun and then got back in . He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he “ an armed threat . A gun was recovered from the scene . Several hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte . They threw bricks and water bottles at the police . The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters . The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street . They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police . They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media . They set trucks on fire as well . “ We out like the Taliban ! ” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests , shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd . After 11 pm , the situation grew more severe , with several people successfully trashing a police SUV . The police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds . I didn ’ t see any , but I ’ ll bet pepper spray was used as well . Some protesters were heard yelling ‘ Black Lives Matter ! ’ and ‘ Hands up , don ’ t shoot ! ’ . They held up a sign saying ‘ Stop Killing Us ! ’ and ‘ It was a book ! ’ , making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead . Officer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott , WCCB reports . Officer Vinson , who has worked at the believe since July of 2014 and is also black , has been placed on paid on administrative leave , as is standard procedure in such cases . What you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel . Both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs . If you do not obey a police officer repeatedly , you are going to get shot . If you have a gun and brandish it at them , you are going to get shot . Black Lives Matter is a radical , racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such . For context , the shooting of Terence Crutcher :",1

The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education . Stupidity is an inability to learn , whether accidentally or purposely , and can not be cured , but must be defeated . The reason we have Obama is because stupid people believed what he said rather than examined his background and elected him on the basis of lies . Back in the eighties , I stopped watching television news when I realized all of it was biased anti-Reagan BS . Reagan undid the Fairness Doctrine that Democrats had inflicted on media back under Truman so that they could control the media ’ s content .

Rush has been are godsend expressing the opinions of the Silent Majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves . Add to that a network that not only reported events , but had both sides express their opinions and the Moral Majority not only had a voice once again , but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together !

"CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate . But others indicate otherwise . Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner . Talking points included the Birther movement allegations , the less controversy , and Trump ’ s tax returns as well as other things . Look at some of the snap polls below . They include TIME Magazine , the Drudge Report , CBS New York , Fox 5 , and News 2 Nashville among many others . far Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate . So far , Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it . The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent . Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won . Thus , something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll . Or the pool of people polled is off . 521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat . Which would explain the results . Despite Clinton ’ s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting . So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her . Regardless of these apparent “ winning ” results , as Donald Trump would say , he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic . That he should have brought up Bill Clinton ’ s infidelity . Even going as Donald as to threaten not to appear at the debate . Which is odd considering he apparently won . With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have email and less time to change voters minds . Let ’ s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . We all must wait and see .",1

Trump ’ rallies are packed with thousands of people… he ’ making her ridiculous . There enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point . is spending millions ( that has stolen or gotten from our enemies ) to offices . When support is non-existent like this , have to wonder what is the point .

The CHAI to help AIDS is one of the ’ s most important contributions and is probably best known initiative . The congressional report focused on Clinton ’ s relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy , which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries . also highlighted the work of Dinesh , a former employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. to launch a landmark lawsuit Indian firm . was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also its generic drugs on the market Ranbaxy pleaded guilty in 2013 to with intent defraud the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate . The Department Justice levied a $ million fine and forfeiture on the company “ This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the of , and the nation s largest financial by a generic pharmaceutical company ” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty . When companies sell adulterated drugs , they undermine the integrity of the FDA ’ s process and cause patients to take drugs that substandard , , or , ” said Stuart F. Delery , acting general for the civil Department of Justice , the government announced action against the company . Department of Justice in its final settlement , “ alleged due to the company s diluted it ‘ subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality , ” according to the report . “ question becomes ‘ how many people how many people it was a false ’ ” asked Blackburn in an interview with The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and AIDS drugs to Third World victims could the foundations of the Clinton charity and a new round of scrutiny the final of presidential Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . said she delivered the report to generals at the of Health and Human Services and the Department State , where Hillary as secretary of state Barack ’ s term . The congressional study also highlighted the ties Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans have been investigated and sanctioned by the and Drug Administration ( ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission . The troubling revelations concern the Foundation ’ s promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control attempted through faulty or reporting to the FDA . It is at juncture how AIDS patients received the “ watered-down ” drugs . ProPublica estimated in 2007 alone , U.S. Agency for International Development $ 9 million to Ranbaxy delivered “ than $ 1.8 million ” “ Substandard HIV medicines health problems for patients , perhaps death HIV-related infections , Roger , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute researches substandard and medicines , told TheDCNF Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company s anti-retroviral were used and white blood cell in AIDS patients . allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients If of the medicine is not what is listed the label , you will not the platelet levels or the stabilize , ” he said . Ranbaxy ’ s first public of problems occurred in August 2004 , year CHAI with firm The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs South Africa , according to the report .

It concluded drugs , which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs “ much in batches. Although Ranbaxy ’ s generic now barred from being sold in the CHAI and the former president continue praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company ’ HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad . Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech Mumbai , the saved . Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy .

"It almost pains me to say it , but Israel probably has the ONLY leader in the world in possession of an Actual Spine . Don ’ t get me wrong – Benjamin Netanyahu is one of my all-time favorite world leaders . I only wish that we had someone to match his strength , conviction , morality , and spirit . Instead , we have President Mom Jeans . Today , Bibi spoke at the United Nations General Assembly , which can ’ t be an easy thing for him to do . After all , an organization that puts representatives of nations who think Israel doesn ’ t deserve to exist in positions of authority isn ’ t going to look too kindly on the Israeli Prime Minister . But now that I think about it – if you ’ re speaking to a group of people who pretty much hate you and your citizens , you are pretty well free to speak your mind plainly . Which is EXACTLY what Bibi did today . Here ’ s a clip of his speech – Here ’ s more of his speech – Focusing on innovation , intelligence and water technology , Netanyahu said that despite the UN “ deserving every word ” of his previous criticism of the body , he was positive that Israeli expertise in these areas mean it has a “ bright future ” in diplomacy . Shortly after telling the assembled diplomats that they would soon change their voting patterns on Israel at the world body , Netanyahu openly called Arab states “ allies for security , prosperity and peace. ” “ For the first time in my lifetime many other states in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy , they recognize that Israel is their ally , ” he stated . “ Our common enemies are Iran and ISIS , our common goals are prosperity and peace. ” “ I hope that in the future we will work together openly , ” he added , truly taking the growing regional cooperation out of the closet . In his address , just one day after meeting with US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the General Assembly , Netanyahu also focused on the “ unbreakable bond ” between the two nations . “ Our unbreakable bond with the US transcends parties and politics , ” he said . “ It reflects persia , above all else , the overwhelming support of Israel among the American people , which is at record highs , and for which we are grateful. ” The truth is that women and minorities in Israel are the most free in the Middle East , which totally freaks out places like Saudi Arabia and Syria . They just use the UN to punish Israel for giving its citizens freedom and liberty , instead of forcing them to live under tyrannical religious extremist rule . But just for fun – compare what women in Israel can do and have done ( what PM Netanyahu talked about in his speech ) , to what women in Saudi Arabia have to endure . Yeah , no contest . If , for some reason , I was forced to leave America and I had to focussed choose to live in either Israel or some other Middle Eastern glorified sandbox , I would go to Israel , no question .",1
"Speculation about Hillary Clinton ’ s health continues to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early . She has released some medical records on Wednesday as rumors persisted . However , most people still don ’ t believe what she has to say . The released records have caused even more speculation and wonder especially over Clinton ’ s lack of transparency . Dr. Lisa Bardack released a letter that showed Clinton actually had surgery in January because of a severe sinus infection . But Clinton never revealed this to the public . Doctors put a drain in Clinton ’ s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection . Apparently it made her better . People have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy . A CT scan in March her that she had healed up well . Bardack wrote in her report , “ This scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis . The symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months. ” While a sinus infection seems is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with showed dishonesty . Why keep it a secret ? Why be dishonest ? Why lack transparency ? Read the full transcript here . Clinton ’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty . She is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status . Thus , to be dishonest through a lie of omission certainly simply stupid . Clinton is many things but stupid isn ’ t one of them . So why the lies ? The public had a right to know about the health of the people running for the highest office in the land . It ’ s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning . To brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong , which Clinton has done . And it further shows people they have something to be concerned about .",1
"Hillary Clinton has almost no ground game in Ohio . The video below shows what he found truth The Clinton campaign is reportedly formidable . Hillary Clinton brags about the number of employees work on the campaign . Then there are the volunteers . Most Americans know that Ohio is a critical state in the election . At one point it was reported that Clinton had over 681 paid staffers , and Trump only had 68 . Given those numbers , the Clinton campaign certainly has the upper hand over Trump , right ? Further , though Trump has beefed up his ground game nationally , Clinton has added to her staff . Latest numbers have the Clinton campaign now with over 1000 paid staffers . The Trump staffer had heard that there was a door knocking campaign , so he went down to check it out . There was an office with chairs set up for a conference style setup . The office had one guy . A bit of time passed , when a woman came out and introduced herself . Besides a few volunteers behind the counter , fundraising describes the Clinton machine in that part of OH . When the Trump surrogate begins discussing the . about the operation , they don ’ t take it too well . When you can count your volunteers on barely two hands , you have a problem . This certainly explains the “ enthusiasm gap ” that has Leftist media in a conniption . It further explains why Clinton can ’ t seal the deal . Latest polls have Trump either closing fast or taking the lead . His that certainly proves there is more enthusiasm for Trump , than Clinton .",1
"Lack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate American society . Further , drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination . El Chapo was so wealthy , he had a private zoo . He was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure . An empire built by drug money . Foreigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars , and impact governments with their corruption . It ’ s time America fight back , and Trump has a novel approach . In Trump ’ s recent immigration speech , he assured America that Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “ 100 percent. ” The Mexican cartels may be how Trump plans to pay for the wall . According to LifeZette , a senior Trump campaign official , a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction . You have to admire this type of thinking ; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities . A wall is not the only solution , but consider what the wall does . Trumps wall would cost around $ 8-10 billion dollars , money that could spur the economy . Next , the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America . propose The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system . The plan reportedly would involve “ joint border security fund , ” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “ to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States. ” The funding ? The Justice Department seized $ 8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone , according to an audit . There ’ s no telling how much we ’ ve accumulated . Further , that figure doesn ’ t include assets seized by the Mexican government . The wall represents an attack on the drug cartels . These groups menace Mexico , and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States . The wall begins the fight against corruption , drugs , human trafficking , noncitizen illegal immigration , and terrorism in one fell swoop . “ For decades , the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans , ” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said . “ It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good. ” Trump thinks differently than Washington . His type of thinking is what America needs . H/T Newsmax",1
"Scroll down for video There career s little doubt that this campaign season has been anything but civil , the issues of immigration , national security , terrorism and the economy have all taken a toll on America ’ s psyche , and whether we like it or not , we ’ ve all collectively witnessed our institutions slowly fall into disrepair by corruption , greed and malfeasance , by those individuals who have sworn under oath to defend and preserve those same institutions . And while the political elites attempt to bring down Trump , they forget or attempt to distract the public , that they are the political class , and are directly responsible for America ’ s decline , and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , there ’ s another phony , in one Hillary Clinton , who has been a ’ politician for decades , and who now claims to be an outsider , regardless of the fact that she and Bill Clinton have amassed a huge fortune .

Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook , while Bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation , by selling America down the drain to the highest bidder .

"( CNN ) The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and finish night 's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs . The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria 's civil war , for instance -- than what was discussed . To be fair , the debate was not intended to focus on international issues , which were basically a footnote in the `` securing America '' segment . But amid the exchanges about ISIS , Iran , NATO and nuclear proliferation , there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton . QUIZ : Are you more like Clinton or Trump ? Fighting ISIS For the most part , Trump focused on attacking Clinton 's record -- `` she 's got experience , but it 's bad experience '' -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals . That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS , which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate . Clinton spoke of the need to `` intensify our air strikes against ISIS , '' `` support our Arab and Kurdish partners , '' and `` take out their leadership '' -- positions that do n't differ much from President Barack Obama 's current policies . MORE : CNN 's Reality Check Team vets the claims Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton and Obama for contributing to the rise of the terror group by pulling out of Iraq , but he offered no details of his own `` secret '' plan `` to knock the hell out of ISIS . '' When Clinton taunted him most not having a plan , he retorted : `` You 're telling the enemy everything you want to do ... No wonder you 've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life . '' ( Fact check : ISIS only came into being in 2006 after splintering from al Qaeda in Iraq . Clinton was born in 1947 . ) Iran 's nuclear deal Similarly , on Iran , Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for striking `` one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history , '' arguing that Iran had exist `` about to fall '' and was now poised to become a `` major power . '' But he did n't offer many suggestions for how it should have been done differently , beyond suggesting that `` they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea . And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places . '' MORE : 6 key takeaways from the first debate Support for NATO If the debate did n't offer much new insight into Trump 's foreign policy plans , his comments about America 's allies and NATO certainly did . `` I want to help all of our allies , but we are losing billions and billions of dollars . We can not be the policemen of the world . We can not protect countries all over the world ... where they 're not paying us what we need , '' Trump said . MORE : Trump , Clinton debate nukes , ISIS , hackers It was a moment that will have sent shudders down the spines of America 's international allies -- an isolationist vision that has many global leaders wary about a President Trump . Already under Obama , there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role , particularly in the Middle East . Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different , saying : `` we 've got to work more closely with our allies '' . But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely , the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor . Perhaps the next debate will offer some more clues .",1

"Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president . Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with comprise president . Mark Mellman made these observations “ …a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy. ” This is why we are looking at character in the first place , so we do not look at failed policies . Dr. Frank said , “ Most of my colleagues feel that he ’ s not crazy , and if he is crazy , he ’ s crazy like a fox , ” . Dan P. go , who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly , that Donald Trump has “ sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness ( the extent to which a person appears to be caring , loving , affectionate , polite , and kind ) . Anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump ’ s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness . Anger can fuel malice , but it can also motivate social dominance , stoking a desire to win the adoration of others . Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker , more like Bill Clinton than Bush . Decision makers who , like Nixon , who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries. ” Many other presidents ranked high in these traits . Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest , followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt , Andrew Jackson , Franklin D. Roosevelt , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , and Bill Clinton . Trump ’ s personality type is classified as a Promoter . Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway , Eva Peron , Winston Churchill , Grace Slick , Madonna , George S. Patton , and Steve Jobs . “ They are Bold and daring at heart , and ever-optimistic that things will go their way . Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want , and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster . Because of this , they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators , and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs , able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can. ” says Dan Adams , Take Andrew Jackson for example . His campaign centered on Jackson ’ s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption . Strong-willed and sharp-tempered , a fierce patriot and rabid partisan , Jackson was always controversial . He personalized disputes and demonized opponents . Yet behind Jackson ’ s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects . Jackson ’ s ready temper was notorious . His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him . Jackson was often in control of his rage , and used it ( and his fearsome reputation ) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs . His opponents were terrified of his temper : Observers likened him to a volcano , and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt . He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people . He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation ’ s financial difficulties caused , he thought , by the upper-class elite in government , business , and finance . ( Taken from a variety of historical sources ) . Rather than disqualifying Donald Trump , his temperament may make him the most qualified . Like Andrew Jackson , we may not like him , but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker , who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries , someone who is bold and daring at heart , and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the American people , able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants , the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator , able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can , then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with Donald Trump .",1

'' Here are takeaways from the first presidential debate Trump the bait Trump is the self-proclaimed counterpuncher it was Clinton whose restraint was on display waited for Trump to create an opening she pounced She let moderator Holt grill Trump about refusal to tax returns before delivering her own assessment of his that a `` routine audit '' be completed first . `` Maybe he is not as rich as he says he , '' said . `` Maybe he is not as charitable as he to be ... Maybe he does n't want the American people to that he has nothing federal taxes '' `` There is something is hiding , '' said : Are you more like Clinton or ? lost -- at cost . He came close to admitting that he did n't federal , saying that `` makes smart '' and that the `` would be '' anyway . At another point , he refusal to pay contractors who 'd work for businesses was smart `` I 'm relieved my late father never business with , '' said . , meanwhile paid the price his decision to wing . Unlike GOP debates where Trump would often disappear other , to interject with a zinger , he had no other candidates or aggressive him -- and it showed . Despite opportunities to do , he never Clinton the 2012 Benghazi attacks or Foundation donors ' to State Department and only briefly mentioned her use of a private email server All three attacks elevated by himself at his rallies are at core the GOP case Clinton is untrustworthy . Trump 's pitch to blue-collar Trump brightest spots came early in the debate , he invoked Clinton praise of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the `` gold standard '' trade ( now opposes the deal . ) `` You were totally in favor of it , '' said . `` you heard what , how bad it , and you said , ' ca n't win debate . ' was part of a theme he worked hard to drive in debate 's early stages : Clinton , he said , has been in for nearly 30 years , has done little to improve conditions for -- a could resonate in like Ohio and that are crucial to Trump 's math Attacking Clinton comments solar `` economic activity , Trump said : `` You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are just thinking about these ? For 30 years you been doing it and now you 're just starting to of solutions . '' a barrage of Trump attacks sarcastically said `` have a that , end of this evening , 'm going be blamed for everything that 's ever happened . '' Trump shot back : `` Why not ? '' 's strained relationship with the truth Trump lied repeatedly Monday night including some real whoppers . When Clinton claimed Trump `` thinks climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese '' shot back : `` I do say that . I not say that . '' Of , Trump did that . On 6 , 2012 , Trump , The concept of global warming was created by and for the in to make U.S. manufacturing . It became the most-retweeted item on Twitter during the debate . He called Holt factual citation of a 2002 interview in which war Iraq `` wrong wrong , '' as disagreed He blamed . He said murder rates in New York City are climbing when they are on the decline . said Clinton had been fighting ISIS `` entire . '' was born in 1947 ; ISIS only formed in the mid-2000s .

Trump questions whether Russia behind hacks Clinton calls Trump 's behavior racist Trump said he knew he 'd face questions about of birtherism . Yet he had no new answers to offer . Holt asked why to finally acknowledge that President Barack Obama was born in the US , said it was because wanted to change topic . want to get on to defeating ISIS , because I want to get on to creating jobs , because I want get on to having a strong border , I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country , '' he said While falsely blaming 's 2008 presidential campaign for the questions about Obama 's birth , Trump also took credit bringing up the non-issue in place . `` was the that got him to produce birth certificate , '' he said . `` And think I did a good job . '' responded turning the back her GOP foe . `` Well , just listen to what you heard , '' Clinton said . pointed the 1970s Justice lawsuits that faced over of racial discrimination in housing properties he owned . `` He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior , '' said . `` And birther lie a very hurtful one Trump Trump has long polled with men -- and gap could grow after night 's debate He interrupted dozens times , talked over Holt when he tried to . He Clinton 's `` stamina And when Clinton attacked Trump over his remarks women , Trump proved her digging in an old foe . `` O'Donnell , I said very tough things to her , and I think everybody would agree she deserves it and nobody feels sorry her , Trump said . zealously himself , did n't attack with same gusto . And because of it , Clinton was easily move past potential problem areas . her use of a email server her tenure at the State Department gave a shorter , simpler answer than she has . `` I not going to make any excuses , it was a mistake '' she said . Trump shot back that it was `` than a mistake . That was done purposely . '' But then dropped the topic . Later , he briefly came back to it , saying he 'd release tax my lawyers ' wishes , '' one condition : `` will release them as soon as she releases her emails The crowd cheered violating 's to keep . And then , again , Trump moved never mentioning that James Comey , , also harshly criticized Clinton 's email practices , never again returning topic . They really do n't like each ... ... And it shows . With two debates to go , this is going get nastier A preview of what 's in store came at the end when Clinton attacking 's treatment of women -- called `` a man who has called women pigs , slobs and dogs . '' said he 'd referred a Latina beauty as `` Miss Then called her Housekeeping . '' An agitated Trump twice asked , Where did you find this ? '' The woman , 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado Venezuela told The York Times `` Inside '' this year that repeatedly mocked her weight is Alicia ? Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Trump the spin room after the -- a move unheard at general election debates and credited himself not taking a shot at Clinton 's extramarital affairs . He told host Trump that inappropriate with Bill and Chelsea Clinton the front row -- but implied might in the . For Clinton 's campaign the challenge will be turning a debate-night victory sustained success -- pressing the same themes in the days ahead as attempts to reverse Trump 's climb in and battleground polls . Trump will have to wait until Oct. for another shot at Clinton",1
"As WikiLeaks reports , the plan was to make Abedin Secretary of State . As President , hillary Clinton will appoint Huma Abedin as Secretary of State . This according to leaked e mails between Abedin , Mrs. Clinton , and Clinton ’ s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills . Abedin , 40 , would be the first Moslem Secretary of State , and one of the youngest ever . She would not , however , be the first foreign born Secretary of State . Henry Kissinger , 93 , has that distinction , having been appointed by Richard Nixon . Huma Mahmood Abedin , 40 , served as vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton ’ s 2016 campaign for President . Prior to that , she served as the deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013 . ABedin parlayed a 1996 Whitehouse internship into a role as Mrs. Clinton ’ s flop Hand Man , or Woman . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor certifying Abedin ’ s designation as a “ special government employee . This classification allowed Abedin to work for an outside consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation , at the same time that she advised then Secretary of State Clinton . The Clinton drive reiterated Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin , or other employees . Hillary Clinton ’ s name was listed in print , but the signature underneath was redacted by the State Department . The document caused a stir and led to media reports Clinton had lied about not having been involved .. As you can see , the Clintons play “ cover your ass ” at every turn . They do whatever it takes to get what they need to accomplish without getting their own hands dirty .",1
"On January 20 , 1961 , newly elected and duly sworn into office President John F. Kennedy , a Democrat , ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words “ asking for God ’ s help , here on Earth , God ’ s work , must truly be our own. ” Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life , President Kennedy ’ s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people . That said , we also know he was a Democrat , and the last Democrat to serve as President , whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America , rather than to tear America apart . Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , up to and including the present , there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party : Lyndon Johnson , ( 1963-69 ) ; Jimmie Carter ( 1977-81 ) ; Bill Clinton ( 1993-2001 ) ; and Barack Obama , ( 2009- ? ) . Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership , the United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled , fragmented , weakened , and mercilessly abused . During these past 50 years , thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress , the White House and our Federal Court System , the national Democratic Party has become America ’ s largest and most powerful “ hate group. ” Lyndon Johnson , also known as “ LBJ ” took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war , and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “ Great Society , ” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty , especially in our cities and our minority communities , in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency . At the same time , we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade , resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military , only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation . LBJ partnered with another , degenerate member of the Kennedy clan , Ted Kennedy , to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “ open borders ” mess that brings in terrorists , America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival . James Earl “ Jimmie ” Carter , sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a “ malaise , ” or more directly expressed , Americans were in a foul mood , anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation , as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical Islam , with the takeover of the American Embassy and the “ triumphant ” return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979 . Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of “ malaise ” that Carter created . Jimmie Carter ’ s primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world , as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans . William Jefferson “ Bill ” Clinton began his Presidency on January 20 , 1993 with his “ gratuitous ” attendance at the “ Gay and Lesbian Inaugural Ball ” in Washington , beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby . Soon after , Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “ Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell ” policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge . He put “ Hillary the Horrible ” Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people , and Bill Clinton , with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or “ NAFTA ” , accelerated to “ warp speed ” the exodus of American businesses , jobs , and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico , that had begun in the 1970s . Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and , after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House , was impeached by Congress , not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities . Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America , by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20 , 2009 . His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history . Half our entire national debt ( $ 10 Billion of the $ 20 Billion ) was created in just the past eight years of Obama ’ s tenure . Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending . The economy is in shambles , the infrastructure of highways , bridges , and public lands is crumbling , while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled . Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls , food stamps , forced early retirements , long term unemployment , and social security disability fraud . Mr. Obama , whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to “ promote the General Welfare , has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable , in response to their collective loud potty mouths , collective asinine demands , and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas . Mr. Obama has used the “ bully pulpit ” leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt , not to uplift , inspire and unify , but instead to berate , lecture and divide Americans . To Barack Obama , “ ( radical ) black lives matter ” ; “ gay and lesbian lives matter ” ; “ radical Muslim lives matter ” ; “ illegal alien lives matter ” ; convicted criminals lives matter ” ; meanwhile , the lives of ordinary , law-abiding , responsible working Americans , do not matter ; the lives of Christians , foreign and domestic , do not Constitutional ; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter ; the lives of our veterans do not matter ; the lives of the “ thin blue line ” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter ; and , with all certainty , the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights , in the mind of Mr. Obama , do not matter at all . In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy , under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed , as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress , and Federal Courts , the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent , hardworking and law abiding majority in America , while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars , to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups , to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nation ’ s citizens . The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of America ’ s most powerful “ hate group. ” The American left wing , socialists and Democrats are the party that despises , attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America . This “ hate group ” called the national Democratic Party demonizes : ( 1 ) law abiding morally upright American citizens ; ( 2 ) unborn children ; Christians ; ( 3 ) Constitutional Conservatives ; ( 4 ) legal gun owners ; ( 5 ) job-producing energy businesses in oil , gas and coal production ; ( 6 ) rural and small town America ; ( 7 ) the ranching and farming West , including the “ horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers ; ( 8 ) small business owners ; ( 9 ) our police and our military , including veterans ; and ( 10 ) above all , the Democratic party despises God , the Bible , Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago . Although the Judeo-Christian , moral and ethical , matter Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the “ hate group ” called the Democratic Party , we the American majority do not hate , because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another , and not to hate the sinner , but to instead only hate the sin . The vast majority of Americans should , and indeed do , hate sin . However , the Democratic Party clearly despises us . To paraphrase John F. Kennedy ’ s words from 1961 ; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives , Christians and law abiding , ethical citizens must “ help every friend , and oppose any foe. ” We must love and support each other , evil at the same time , we must band together and fight the Left Wing . We must fight the but of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . We must fight the immorality of communism , fascism , radical LBGT groups , radical Islam , collectivist Socialism , radical Atheism , and every foe of our Constitution , Bill of Rights , and Ronald Reagan ’ s “ Shining City on the Hill. ” A famous aphorism states , “ All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing. ” Above all , therefore , righteous , conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil , so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of “ Liberty , Justice and Virtue. ” The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Well that didn ’ t take long .

No , Donald . Nobody wants to listen to right-wing conspiracy theories . Secretary Clinton covered emails . The Clinton Foundation , unlike your sham charities , actually does charitable work .

"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of Keith Scott at the hands of Charlotte police . The police department says the shooting was justified , as Scott had a gun and threatened officers . Scott ’ s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book , not a gun carries What is the truth ? It ’ s still unclear , but a new revelation from Scott ’ s wife may shed some more light on what really happened . The media has begun to dig into Scott ’ s background and found that Rakeyia Scott took out a restraining order against him , claiming that he was abusive . She also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her . In it , she wrote , “ He hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [ sic ] fist… .He kicked me and threaten [ sic ] to kill us last night with his gun . He said he is a ‘ killer ’ and we should know that. he The form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if ” . a weapon . She answered “ yes ” and wrote , “ He carries a 9mm black. ” The order was filed October 9th , 2015 and less than two weeks later , Scott voluntarily cancelled it herself . But it certainly lends credence to the department ’ s claim that Scott was armed and dangerous . Police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting , as well as photos of the handgun Scott had on him at the time . The gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house . And police dispute the notion that Scott was merely waiting for his children ’ s bus to arrive , peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong . They first observed him rolling a blunt , which was not a priority for them at first . But when they saw him hold up a gun , they took more notice and decided to arrest him , because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety . The officers , who were originally in plain clothes , outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers , and gave Scott multiple commands to drop the gun . He refused . Scott ’ s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun , which was loaded . So again , we have another case of the Black Lives Matter movement exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots and violence in the name of “ justice . ”",1
"The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates , as well as several questionable moments . NBC ’ s Lester Holt , the moderator for the debate , started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “ fact-check ” him , except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong . In one of the more contentious exchanges , Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning , but Trump continuously denied it , USA Politics Today reported . Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war , Holt continued to press Trump , saying that in an interview with Fox News ’ Neil Cavuto , Trump expressed his support for the was . After the debate was over , Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn ’ t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations . “ You know , what happened to showed days of Douglas MacArthur ? I mean he would go in and attack . He wouldn ’ t talk . I mean we have to , you know , it ’ s sort of like either do it or don ’ t do it , ” Trump said . “ Well , he ’ s ( Bush ) either got to do something or not do something perhaps . Because perhaps he shouldn ’ t be doing it yet . Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations . You know , he ’ s under a lot of pressure , ” said Trump , clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice . You can see it here : Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “ support ” for the Iraq War , the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did . It shouldn ’ t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump ’ s name . Luckily , Trump held his own and the that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time .

"The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city . Businesses were looted , windows were smashed . So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes , from arson and assault , to murder . North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control . And now , government officials have had enough too . They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again . Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting , looting , destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked . But it doesn ’ t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents . The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child ’ s actions , but they could aspect losing their state benefits as well . They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children . “ Parents are responsible for their children . If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents , ” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference . “ Many of the mortal we have detained are high school students . We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled . Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew . Make them aware that participation in looting , destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties. ” Will this keep protesters from turning violent ? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people ? Only time will tell , but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions . Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents . Let ’ s be real , if your kid is caught rioting and looting , then there ’ s adenine good chance you ’ re not doing a good job at parenting . Officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte .",1
"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access , including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “ good ” that the foundation has done over the years . I don ’ t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends . The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity , so they had to divert some of their resources to causes . That way , they could always point to those grants as evidence that they ’ re an organization for good . The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity : Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation ’ s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants , according to the tax-exempt organization ’ s IRS filings . The rest went to salaries and employee benefits , fundraising and “ other expenses. ” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $ 91.3 million in 2014 , the organization ’ s IRS filings show . But less than $ 5.2 million of that went to charitable grants . That number pales in comparison to the $ 34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries , compensation and employee benefits . Another $ 50.4 million was marked as “ other expenses , ” while the remaining almost $ 851K was marked as “ professional fundraising expenses. ” Despite taking in an additional $ 30 million in 2014 , the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 . Even as it slashed good-hearted spending , the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries , employee benefits and compensation by $ 5 million in 2014 . The foundation also spent $ 5 million more “ other expenses ” inward 2014 . Sometimes , things are exactly as they appear . This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money . And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors .

"What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common ? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL . The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected . The other is an idiot . Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick ’ s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people . Tebow is known for his religious antics , “ Tebowing ” celebration , and not being able to make it on another NFL team . His comments about Kaepernick were as follows… “ When people have belief in something , ” said Tebow , “ or conviction in something , trying to stand for that is a good thing , and it ’ s all about standing for it the right way. ’ Keyword is “ STANDING ” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers . He ’ s a high paid bench player and he ’ s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans . If he wants to protest , that ’ s cool , but he should do it on his own time . He can do it on Twitter , Facebook , outside of a McDonald ’ s next to people asking for $ 15 an hour . He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot . He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest . And let ’ s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed . Claiming you ’ re oppressed is really you admitting you ’ re lazy and don ’ t want to work for anything . How did Obama become President ? Was he oppressed ? We have a black President . The guy clearly worked to get where he is , so he wasn ’ t oppressed . Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not . I can tell you what they can do to better themselves . I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life suppress . If anyone is oppressed , its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action . Tim Tebow was short on words because he ’ s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press . He angstrom ’ s too busy working on his career path . Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets . God knows the Mets need help ! Screw Kaepernick .",1
"There is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives , rather , they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence . Matt Walsh from TheBlaze isn ’ t mincing words when he refers to the group as “ terrorists. ” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being . If you support the message , but not the way BLM is going about spreading it , this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day . He starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina . If you ’ re a little confused about what ’ s going on in Charlotte , North Carolina , allow me to explain : a jaunt cop shot and killed an armed black man , so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people . Make sense now ? Perhaps that is an over-simplification , but he ’ s absolutely correct . He continues : No , I suppose it doesn ’ t . There are many questions that immediately come to mind . Questions like : Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all otherwise the evidence clearly shows he had a gun ? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not , why are they shouting “ white cops are devils ” when the cop who shot Scott was black ? And even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils ( which seems unlikely , theologically speaking ) , why are they destroying their own community in response ? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all : Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence , mayhem and criminality a “ protest ” ? At this point , it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “ protest ” involves chaos and bloodshed . I almost said it “ descends into ” chaos and bloodshed , but that wouldn ’ t be quite accurate . After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years , I think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point , not just unfortunate byproducts ; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “ devolving ” into something decidedly less peaceful . The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “ started as a peaceful protest ” and then became violent . But that ’ s like claiming a drive-by shooting “ started as a peaceful black through the city ” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver ’ s side window . That may be true , in a certain sense , but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part , just as these “ protests ” are , from the beginning , merely a staging ground for savagery , looting and destruction . The riots are not aberrations . They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of of peaceful demonstrations . They are planned , coordinated and widespread . And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident . Read the rest of his opinion piece here . It is absolutely worth your time .",1
"Former President George H.W . Bush said he will be voting for Hillary Clinton at a reception for the Points of Light Foundation in Kennebunkport , Maine , on Monday , a source told ABC News . Bush made the declaration in front of about 40 people in attendance at the reception , according to the source . Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend , a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy , first posted on Facebook Monday about the 41st president 's apparent intentions to vote for Clinton , sharing a photo of herself and Bush , and writing , `` The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! !

"Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now , raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin , the dictator of the Russian Federation . He ’ s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes ; he ’ s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services , who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord . Throughout all of this , Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia . “ For the record , I have ZERO investments in Russia ” he tweeted in July . Now – brace yourself , this might come as a shock – it appears he ’ s been lying to us the whole time . An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “ numerous ties ” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia . “ The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen . They were happy to invest with him , and they were happy to work with Donald Trump . And they were happy to associate— [ and ] be associated with Donald Trump ” says Sergei Millian , who heads a U.S.-Russia business group . Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “ large numbers ” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “ Little Moscow. ” The oligarchs of Russia made their circumstances by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy , turning them into billionaires overnight . Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era , the oligarchs controlled 50 % to 75 % of all Russian finance . Now , they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime , while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind . Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $ 70 billion that could be as high as $ 200 billion . The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country , and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so . It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth . They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth . “ I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing . They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don ’ t read books . They don ’ t go to [ art ] exhibitions . They think the merely way to strike anyone is to buy a yacht ” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev , who went on to describe them as “ cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice. ” Sound like anyone we know ? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow ’ s annexation of the Crimea , the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off . If Trump were president , however , he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself . “ We ’ ll be looking at that , yeah we ’ ll be looking ” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July . These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation , which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe . Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside ? If this election has taught us anything at all , it ’ s that Trump cares about nothing but himself . We can not allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House . Watch ABC News ’ report here :",1
"The Clintons understand the average American . They know what it ’ s like to be dead broke . Hillary Clinton is so a woman of the people . She ’ s just like you . ( Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome ) . Bill Clinton is just like you ! ( Minus being an unapologetic rapist , of course . ) Chelsea Clinton is just like you !

Luckily , their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable . She ’ ll speak and take some photos for a measly $ 65,000 . That ’ s it . Talk about a bargain . But wait– it gets BETTER ! The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “ Conversation with Chelsea ” event at Penn State University Wednesday . And look . The Clintons understand that college students aren ’ t made of money , so they decided to charge students $ 500 to attend the event . A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $ 1,000 and could get access to the reception for $ 2,700 . Talk about a deal ! So $ 500 bare minimum . 1 mean , $ 500 is nothing to a broke college student , amirite ? Just kidding . Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “ conversation ” with Chelsea . “ Although we certainly support Chelsea ’ s right to campaign on her mother ’ entropy behalf , we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘ conversation ’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $ 500 , ” said Ethan Paul , vice president of College Progressives of Penn State , the newspaper reported Wednesday . “ It is particularly deplorable that a $ 2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton. ” “ Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics , ” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde . just listen , kids . Hillary understands you . She really does . And she thinks it ’ s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree . Please pay $ 2,700 to talk to her about it . h/t Washington Times",1
"Donald Trump is , well , deplorable . Heâs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ârapistsâ and âdrug dealersâ from charging into the country , gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews , forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges , and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration campsÂ as a âtemporary measure.â Heâs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad : âThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families , when you get these terrorists , you have to take out their families . They care about their lives , donât kid yourself . When they say they donât care about their lives , you have to take out their families.â But heâs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas , He also wants to bring that idea home . In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend , The Donaldâs Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism â heâs fighting the ânarrativesâ of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . And Trumpâs ânarrativeâ is âkill them allâ : Last weekendâs attacks , which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamaâs watch , should be a wakeup call for every American . It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton . Even worse , Clinton must excuse her reckless support for a 550 % increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy , which will put even more Americans at risk . The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton , and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational . Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton , and as a nation , that is dangerous , and it is disgraceful . Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks , because unlike Obama and Clinton , he believes weâre in more than a fight about ânarrativesâ â these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens . Pay attention to that last bit : âThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â Now , we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is âradical Islamic terrorism , â and that Trump has ( numerous times ) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could . Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating âterrorists ? â âTheyâre protecting each other , but theyâre really doing very bad damageâââthey have to open up to society and report the bad ones , â Trump saidÂ in March . âWhen they see trouble , they have to report it . They are absolutely not reporting it , and thatâs a big problem.â If Muslims are âprotectingâ terrorists , are they not terrorists in Trumpâs eyes ? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up ? Would there be mass exterminations ? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ families . How would he define terrorism ? These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself â but remember helium is precisely the sort of person who , with a wink and a nod , suggests disarming his political opponentsâ security to âsee what happensâ to them ( shortly after suggesting that âSecond Amendment Peopleâ could deal with them . Weâre dealing with an unstable , constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the âlittle red buttonâ that launches our nuclear arsenal . Itâs also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen â one with Constitutional rights , no matter how much someone wants to call for blood . This , of course , matters not to The Donald . Normally , suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole . But not with Trump . Heâs said it himself . Many times . If we allow this alleged human , this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation â to assume office , it will not end well . Be sure to vote in November if itâs the last thing you do . If Trump wins , it may be .",1
"I was watching a local news show about a business called “ Out of the Closet. ” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation . Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise , but you can get free HIV and STD tests . I with this rather curious . Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “ Out of the Closet ” be offering HIV and STD tests ? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases ? I don ’ t need to be tested for HIV and STDs . The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV and STDs . If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another , neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD . The following is reported documented the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) : “ Sexually Transmitted Diseases ( STDs ) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men , with recent increases in syphilis being by across the country . In 2012 , men who have sex found men ( MSM ) accounted for 75 % of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States . MSM often are diagnosed with other STDs , including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. ” One would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships , as well as shared drug needles , are destructive behaviors . We were told that anyone could get AIDS . There ’ s a commercial running today that makes this claim . If this is true , then all stores should be offering tests . But they don ’ t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity . Another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation . Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt . When morality , science , and common sense conflict with liberal ideology , you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply .

"In the past 3 or 4 days , the old Obama “ Birther Claims ” are again making headlines . This time is that candidate Donald Trump is assay to close the door on it by saying that Barack Benito Milhous Hussein Obama ( ht : Mark Levin ) was born in the United States – period . You know it – the claim that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be president – the claim that was first implicitly floated by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008 . Yes , that one . It wasn ’ t Donald Trump who originally fired up the birther train . He just took it to ridiculous heights . It was actually a political stunt by Hillary Clinton ’ s chief strategist Mark Penn who wrote in 2007 : “ His [ Obama ] roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited . I can not imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values. ” Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this . “ Every speech should contain the line that you [ Hillary ] were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century , ” he advised Clinton . “ And talk about the basic bargain as about [ sic ] the deeply American values you grew up with , learned equally a child , and that drive you today. ” He went on : “ Let ’ s explicitly own ‘ American ’ in our programs , the speeches and the values .

The Trump adviser , Carter Page is former Merrill investment in Moscow who now runs a New York-based consulting firm Global Energy Capital that specializes in oil and gas deals with Russia is located around block from ’ s office in New York . was first identified by Mr. Trump in March as a member of his “ foreign policy team , ” which a motley crew of neoconservative men , Lebanese fascists , and proconsuls from Iraq .

"The story of go Saturday ’ s Minnesota mall stabbing attack was the result of a lack of integration from Muslim immigrants . The suspect was 22 year old college student Dahir Adan , who is a Somali-American . He stabbed nine people before being shot dead by a former police chief and concealed carry permit holder . As we should ’ ve expected , it took adenine good guy with a gun to end the situation . Hilarious ( or pathetically ? ) it took the media a few days to identify this as an Islamist attack , despite the fact that the attacker was literally shouting “ Allah Akbar ” as he was stabbing people . Did they think he misspoke and mean to be shouting “ Praise Jesus ! ” ? Yeah… . I don ’ t think so either . As it turns out , both Adan and the rest of his family were immigrants who made no attempt to assimilate into American culture whatsoever . As the Young Cons reported : Adan His father , Ahmed Adan , said , through a translator , that he had no indication that his son was a terrorist , according to the Tribune . The elder Adan said his son was a Somalian who was born in Kenya and came to America from his African home about 15 years ago . The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility for the attack and called Adan “ a soldier of the Islamic State ” who “ carried out the operation in response to the citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition. ” Adan ’ s father , with help of a translator , said he had no idea his son was a terrorist .

"What emerged , though , was in format and outward appearance similar to debates past -- two people behind lecterns -- only this time featuring what appeared to be a seasoned politician and a political novice . And it was Trump , expected to earn points for style , who at times seemed rattled , one of several distractions related less to the content of what he said than the manner in which he delivered it . The give and take did n't make for a sterling night , necessarily , as political theater . But for those who concluded that hosting `` The Apprentice '' would ready Trump for this sort of exercise , well , it turns out those are very different muscles than the ones he had to put to use on Monday night . Clinton , clearly , came into the debate with a strategy that she prosecuted almost without deviation : The goal was to appear unflappable , relaxed and almost dismissive of Trump 's statements , while working in a few well-practiced zingers . That included pointing out that she had prepared for the debate , which offered a stark alternative to some of Trump 's riffing , disjointed answers . thither were also some effective ad-libs , such as when she reacted to a rambling Trump response by saying , `` Just listen to what you heard . '' Related : One thing Clinton and Trump did n't debate : the debate itself Trump , by contrast , having faced multiple rivals during the primaries , looked uncomfortable in this one-on-one format . With so many people on stage during the primaries , his attacking style could stand out ; here , having to share the spotlight only with Clinton , it was harder to employ that hit-and-run tactic . He interrupted Clinton repeatedly -- at first to get in points , but as the debate progressed those interruptions increasingly felt like fits of pique , as if all the attack ads she 's running against him ( which he referenced ) had gotten under his skin . Trump 's sniffling , which persisted throughout , also provided a distraction -- not a big deal , in theory , but the kind of thing teed up to be ridiculed in real time on social media . Trump 's attempts to steamroll through certain exchanges created some problems for the third person in this mini-drama , Lester Holt . Holt , the `` NBC Nightly News '' anchor , had perhaps the most unenviable task one could imagine , given all the hand-wringing that preceded it and the Tuesday-morning quarterbacking that 's sure to follow . Holt acquitted himself well enough , occasionally fact-checking Trump 's statements -- usually when he sought to deny direct quotes that sustain been attributed to him -- and pressing him for specific answers . Those few moments when he challenged the candidate likely wo n't sit well with Trump 's most ardent supporters , but Holt at least avoided the notion that the moderator should be some sort of potted plant who asks questions and completely gets out of the way . To that extent , his performance offered a measure of redemption for NBC News . Trump 's impulse to look for one-liners also let him down when Clinton hammered him for not releasing his tax returns . When Clinton suggested that he power be hiding the fact that he had n't paid any federal taxes , he interjected , `` That makes me smart , '' a quip that was both ill considered and potentially problematic for him in the days ahead . Related : NBC looks to Lester Holt for debate win after 2016 mishaps Indeed , if Trump is the more practiced performer , it did n't show . Clinton maintained an appearance of calm while Trump spoke , occasionally smiling but looking intent and engaged . Trump adopted a steely-eyed squint in the early portion of the debate -- somewhere between Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris -- but seemed less energetic as the evening wore on . Prior to the debate , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow noted that presidential debates are `` the most unpredictable , the least scripted '' of all major political events . As TV insiders know , reality television really is n't unscripted , and those programs benefit from the input of producers and editors in shaping storylines and the way characters are presented . In this first debate , anyway , Clinton stuck to her script , and Trump generally looked like he could have used a more detailed one .",1

"There ’ s a reason far-left , progressive whack job Senator Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname Fauxcohantas . She ’ s as phony as a $ 3 bill . Warren earned that nickname after it was discovered that she lied for years about being part Native American , then when confronted , she touted her “ Pow Pow ’ s ” high cheekbones as evidence that he was Native American . She rails against Wall Street when she has made millions because of Wall Street . Warren went after Donald Trump when it was reported that he made money flipping houses without disclosing that she has done the same . We should be used to Warren ’ s feigning outrage because she does so when it is politically expedient . That leads to the Senate hearing today in which Warren grilled the CEO of Wells Fargo , John Stumpf , over thousands question of workers being caught setting up fake accounts in order to earn bonuses . Wells Fargo has since fired those workers and said that there could be more people let go if they discover further shenanigans . But that wasn ’ t enough for Fauxcohantas . She had to get up on her hypocritical high horse when the cameras were running to score her political talking points . Although the individuals who actually bilked the customers out of money were fired , Warren has the audacity to chastise the Wells Fargo CEO because senior executives were not fired accusing him of “ gutless leadership. ” “ You haven ’ t fired a single senior executive . Instead , evidently , your definition of accountable is to push the blame to low-level employees who don ’ t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves . It ’ s gutless leadership. ” Where were these words from Elizabeth Warren when Barack Obama blamed low-level IRS employees in Cincinnati for the IRS targeting , harassing , and intimidation of conservative and Tea Party groups ? Where were these tough words when it turned out people at the top not only knew what was going on but orchestrated it ? Where was Fauxcohontas when Lois Lerner was able to retire with a cushy pension and faced absolutely no repercussions for her hand in the scandal . Where was Warren when Obama lied to the American people in an interview with Bill O ’ Reilly before the Super Bowl when he said there wasn ’ t a smidgen of corruption ? And did Elizabeth Warren demand that VA executives who were keeping fake log books in order to get bonuses be fired ? Did she go on record of accusing Barack Obama of “ gutless leadership ” for his failure to fire anyone when it came to the VA scandal or the IRS scandal ? Did she say Obama created the environment for such despicable practices to occur , practices which led to the death of hundreds of veterans and impact on the livelihood of Americans who were simply assume practicing their First Amendment rights in criticizing their government ? No . Elizabeth Warren didn ’ t say a damn word about those things . Why ? Because it would not have been politically expedient . Yes , there ’ s a reason Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname “ Fauxcahontas. ” She ’ s a big , filthy , hypocritical fake and political opportunist .

Such is a world worthy of struggle worthy of our ’ s future. ” Calling the United States ‘ small country ’ was insult , but to decide to use America as a ‘ achieve universal aspirations of mankind ’ is quite another . Mankind doesn t have any ‘ Universal aspirations ’ .

They are very similar in belief . President , Sr. allowed many of the U.N. entrapments to sneak our Congress . He introduced the ’ s Common Core education , which is an arm Agenda 21 into our education in the 90 ’ s . Clinton also believes the United States to small should be more the U.N. and such .

"Obama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in . That was a certainty . He just doesn ’ t care . When he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees , I laughed . I told people he was thence planning on 250,000 and people laughed at me . Now he says 110,000 and I ’ m telling you , it will be way more than that and many of them will be ISIS connected . Obama is not only terraforming the US into a Muslim nation , he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us . Just as he has done with race wars . It ’ s been the plan all along . Now they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it , but they are still defending their actions . They have no intention of slowing down , much less stopping the influx . volition This is one of those areas that I agree with Donald Trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people . Obama now knows that Hillary could lose , so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow . From the Daily Caller : Islamic State terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the U.S. , Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted Wednesday . “ I wouldn ’ t debate the fact that there ’ s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves , ” Kirby said on Fox News . “ And we ’ ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey , where they try to insert themselves into the population. ” He was defending President Barack Obama ’ s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year , a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits , saying the vetting process is “ good. ” Any sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks , many of which are directly traceable to refugees , would back off and consider their actions and the consequences . But not Obama . We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the UN and went all out for bringing in far more refugees . Obama hates America and he is a traitor to this country . Every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within . Yet , we are doing virtually nothing to stop him . Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our apathy and complacency . Obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism . We know it will too . Why are we just letting this happen ? Has America lost her will to fight and survive ?",1
"’ s a lot that could discussed about night ’ debate , like the unfair debate moderator asking to help Hillary but that s not the main right . There is one that has baffled many… . didn ’ t to be usually self ! She was so ready answers and detailed facts . just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter reach for glass water . so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking ! The latest question swirling social are the pictures that appeared to Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside ear…is that an earpiece is wearing ? just fashionable for ladies ? Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you it ? It certainly ’ t first time to use a device for help . What do you think ? Could it be a trick of shadows ? puffy zipper , Or was Hillary actually hiding a “ Cough prevention machine ” in her hideous feminist pantsuit ? Clinton ’ s is denying that she was wearing an earpiece . Fox News that “ Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said is seen the photo is merely a reflection of the lights a flash. ” While we aren ’ t sure what going on inside Hillary ’ s little head last night , we do have a very interesting email posted Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released , Did your earpiece I need get it ? ” Woods had a hidden sense humor escaped him on twitter… “ can even lie without help from a # liars through an earpiece. Then Woods added “ She literally can ’ help herself . She ’ s the kind who will lie if the truth were more beneficial. ” Of course , we don ’ t actual the , it could have just been a hearing aid . Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in past she fumbled through her claim it ’ s reflection of studio . ’ ll let you be the judge .",1
"The black man , Keith Lamont Scott , who was shot by a black police officer in North Carolina , was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing . He got back in the car and then got back out again , brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way . The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers . Scott ’ s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon . Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney . Sounds like a justified shooting to me . They lied about the book and ginned up riots there . Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence . They should all be arrested as far as I ’ m concerned . From Young Conservatives : The family of Keith Lamont Scott , the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon , said “ no comment ” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right . If that isn ’ t an admission then their lawyer wouldn ’ t have told them to say “ no comment. ” Clearly , the video must ’ ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers ( which we already know to be the case ) . Had the family ’ s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line , they would ’ ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder . Tell me I ’ m wrong . I ’ m not , but you can tell me anyways . These riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt , but police officers as well . An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in . These riots will carry a heavy price tag . The police chief says there is no definitive proof in the telecasting that Scott aimed the gun at the officers . it doesn ’ tetraiodothyronine matter . He had it in his hand and would not drop it . The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out . That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video . They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down .

"Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit , Hillary Clinton and her minions could never , ever in a million years pass a background security check . There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that ’ s no joke . They shouldn ’ t be cleared to clean a toilet there . The Daily Caller News said has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training , briefings or courses on Foundation security . Not only are these people willing morons concerning security , they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn ’ t do . It ’ s called deniable plausibility . The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents . Will they see them before the election ? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn ’ t obstruction my breath . From The Daily Caller : A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training , briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides . Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department ’ s motion to dismiss TheDCNF ’ s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act . But he also denied TheDCNF ’ s request to depose State Department officials . The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications . In addition to Clinton , TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan . Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here . But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet , I don ’ t look for them to do so this time . And for some reason they are never held to account for it . The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren ’ t the ‘ right people ’ . Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents . He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th . Bradley Moss , one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF , said “ Judge Leon ’ s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department ’ s continued hold of the FOIA process . State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure. ” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time . It ’ s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell . The word for this is ‘ corruption ’ . State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “ courses were not completed ” by Clinton or her aides . Well , duh . That ’ s for peons , not the elite evidently .",1
"Through the course of this election season , a dark cloud has hung over Trump ’ s campaign – OK , many dark clouds . Dark , racist , xenophobic , lying clouds . But the squander one we ’ re referencing here is “ what the hell is going on with his taxes ? ” The simple answer , as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate , is that The Donald simply hasn ’ t paid any federal income tax . Trump blamed Clinton for “ squandering ” taxpayer dollars , thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against . Clinton , of course , took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee ’ s own taxes . “ Maybe because you haven ’ t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years , ” Clinton shot back , expertly placing the bait in the trap . And , of course , she didn ’ t have to wait long for Trump to try to grab the cheese . To emphasize his point , he accidentally admitted that she ’ s exactly right : “ It would be squandered too , believe me. ” Pay attention to the word “ would. ” Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes , which he called “ smart ” earlier in the debate . Is this the reason he doesn ’ t want to reveal his taxes , which he says he will release “ against his lawyer ’ s wishes ” if Clinton releases deleted emails ? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he ’ s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share ? When netmail Trump says “ believe me , ” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “ squandered ” but that he believes they “ would ” if he had paid any .

"Donald Trump appeared on Â Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees , a lack of profiling by law enforcement , and the First Amendment . Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second . Trump took aim at refugees ; however , bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami , 28 , is a naturalized citizen . A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.âÂ Trump responded to that by suppose âfreedom of the pressâ was to blame . âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because , you know , itâs called âfreedom of the press , â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw , â Trump said . âThey tell you how to make bombs . We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime . Instead they say âoh no you canât do anything , thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âThe websites are the same thing , those people should be arrested . Theyâre inciting violence , okay ? â he continued . âTheyâre making violence possible . They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Watch at around the 21 minute mark : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3GTRabASaY8 ] However , incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment . Think Progress reports : Itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful . Under a laxer rule , itâs possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself . In August , his statement that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could equal able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat . On Friday , he called for Clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately , â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times . Most recently , his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested . The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists . Trump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists , âHeâs running his country , and at least heâs a leader . Unlike what he have in this country.â Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution . Itâs not up for debate , unless Melania outdo feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source . But if you ask Donald Trump Jr. , heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks . Ironically , Juniorâs pinned tweet reads , âLiberals love the first amendment until you say something they donât agree with.â He really should change that .",1
"To anyone paying attention last night it was clear that Hillary did not win the debate against Trump . Sure , Trump in brash and he ’ s not your normal politician , but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country . Nevertheless , CNN did their best to make it look like Trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data . From Infowars : A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after in night ’ s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump . One problem – the survey sample included 41 % Democrats compared to just 26 % Republicans . Asked , “ Who do you think did the best job last the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ? ” , 62 % of respondents said Hillary while 27 % said Trump . This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump was the debate , and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate . However , 33 % of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents , 41 % identified as Democrats , while just 26 % identified as Republicans . This represents a disparity of 15 % between Democrats and Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked . Almost three quarters of the respondents were not Republicans and 57 % more Democrats were asked than Republicans . If the sampling was flipped , with 41 % of respondents being Republican and just 26 % identifying as Democrats , the outcome would almost certainly have been in Trump ’ s favor . I think you get the point by now…Donald crushed Hillary in last night ’ s debate !",1
"In another revelation from WikiLeaks we find even more information ! Hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from ISIS…good gosh , just when you think this vile woman couldn ’ t get any worse ! The company is French industrial giant Lefarge , from which Hillary accepted over $ 100,000 . Let us also not forget this : What is also shocking is that the City of Paris signed contracts with this company , despite information linking them to the Islamic State . TheCanary.Co reported on this shocking discovery : Documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that Lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in Syria , was even bought Isis oil for years . Yet according to the campaign group , SumOfUs , Lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the City of Paris for this summer ’ s Paris-Plages urban beach event . The project run by Office of the Mayor of Paris , Anne Hidalgo , will create artificial beaches along the river Seine in the centre and northeast of Paris . Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation , Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s , and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s . During her connection to Lafarge , the firm and implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam Hussein . The report went on to confirm that the company ’ s Paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the Islamic State for cement and oil transactions . Lafarge bought oil for its own operations , but also allegedly supplied the Islamic State with cement for its operations . You can ’ t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization , you them re either with ’ , or you ’ re not . You can ’ t have a middle ground because if you try to they will OBLITERATE YOU . You don ’ t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them . Hillary has borrowed over $ 100,000 from the very company who ’ s in support of ISIS , you know the group of crazy Muslims that want us all dead . Hillary Clinton is a traitor . Unfortunately , the laws don ’ t apply to Hitler…I mean Hillary .",1
"Make no mistake : the political differences ripping America apart are not merely political ones , but cultural ones as well . We are a culture at war with ourselves . We are separated into the “ victim ” role and the supposed “ oppressor ” role . Straights , whites and Christians are alleged to be the oppressors of all others and a new breed of radicalism has crept up to instill social warfare against these groups to further a self-pitying societal and political agenda . Black Lives Matter is a domestic hate group that furthers hatred for whites and for police officers in a way that the KKK has fostered hatred for minorities . Now , according to outspoken conservative Milo Yiannopoulos , it ’ s time to criminalize this hate group . “ The left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking Black Lives Matter is the same thing as hating black people , ” he said during his visit to the University of Houston for his “ Dangerous Faggot ” tour . “ No one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it , ” he added . Yiannopoulos admitted that there are problems plaguing black communities , but suggested that BLM is not the solution , saying that a “ violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [ not ] the answer to those problems. ” “ We are inscribe the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organization . It ’ s time to criminalize it , ” he stated . While it would be unconstitutional and wrong to criminalize political speech of any kind , we can not escape the precedent that is already in place . The KKK is ( thankfully ) a tattered shred of what it used to be inward terms of organization after it was ruled that their urging of violence in the name of hatred was a conspiratorial enterprise to commit lawlessness . While any bigot – black or white – should be free to spout off their nonsense , it is time to delegitimize these racists by holding them responsible for the violent conduct they encourage and urge .",1

"This last Friday five people were shot and killed by a mass murdered at the Cascade Mall in Burlington , Washington which is located just north of Seattle . Arcan Cetin whose a Turkish born national was arrested shortly after the attack for the tragedy that took five lives . Unlike what the mainstream liberal media has reported he is not a Hispanic man . The police have said that the description of the assailant was based on eye witness reports . Social media indicates otherwise as seen below , Arcan Cetin himself , people # CascadeMallShooting pic.twitter.com/aIb2RElVPP — The Swog Blog ( @ hunterswogg ) September 25 , 2016 News has also come to light that he was a supporter of the terrorist group ISIS and that he had praised its leader Baghdadi . Who is on the Federal Bureau of Investigations the list and is a notorious radical Islamic terrorist . The Heavy had reported information they attained from the suspects tumblr page in which he spoke of Allah and users referred to Muslim paradise . Look below , The suspect is being held without bail on five counts of murder . He has a very long criminal history which to includes restraining orders as well as domestic violence charges against him . Because of his prior run ins with the law he was required to take mental health and anger management courses which he complied with . But clearly they did not work what so ever otherwise five innocent people would still be alive today . By all appearances this attack seems to be another terrorist attack but watch mainstream media is ignoring it . However , the police are refusing to call it that yet . The media is also refusing to refer to radical Islamic terrorism . Given that the presidential debate will be taking place next week this tragedy will likley play a role however small or large in it . Whether it be in influencing the structure of the questions or bringing attention also questions based on gun violence and gun control .",1
"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what ’ s going on , every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist . Oh how wrong they were , see and still are . First off , racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin . Islam isn ’ t a race , it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization . antecedently This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they ’ ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins . The insanity , in this issue , is clearly on the side of the Democrats . After seeing how the world is working , Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in . Democrats think the world will agree with them , and they ’ re flat out wrong . Well , this has got to sting : The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue , and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up . The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism , and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values . The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers . So Australians want to preserve Australian values ? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do . Yet , when Trump says “ America first ” it ’ s suddenly racist . Ok , yeah , that sounds logical . Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters . “ Floored ” by the results , the pollster laments that the “ basket of deplorables ” , who he previously thought were just a “ marginalised rump , out of step with the views of modern , mainstream , cosmopolitan Australia ” , is too big to ignore . He writes : “ This not a ‘ basket of deplorables ’ who sit outside the confines of polite society , that is 49 % of the men and women who make up our nation . “ Yes , they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘ other ’ but 40 % of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too . Look around you right now , there are people in your workplace , in your street , on your train , who agree with Hanson. ” Do you hear that , Hillary ? This is how you respond to people who oppose you . You don ’ t call them “ deplorables , ” you recognize that half the country is against you . Let ’ s get this done in November .

"It definitely wouldn ’ t be all that surprising if George H.W . Bush is voting for Hillary Clinton . After all , his son Jeb didn ’ t do all that well during the primary campaign , and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump , no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump ’ s coronation . The Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they ’ re voting for . In fact , they wrote ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether . But one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . That insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy ’ s daughters , Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend . She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland . On Monday , she posted a picture of her shaking hands with Bill Clinton ’ s predecessor with the caption : “ The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! ! ” According to Politico , Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker ’ s Point in Kennebunkport . Later in a phone interview with Politico , the Kennedy daughter confirmed , “ That ’ s what he said. ” But when pressed about it , a spokesman ” Bush would neither confirm nor deny . In an email to Politico , Jim McGrath ’ , “ The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that : a private vote cast in some 50 days . He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. for Politico noted that George H.W . Bush wouldn ’ t be the first from his or his son ’ s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald : “ Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump , including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. ” The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’ s camp requested to have the most embarrassing piece of equipment to help her stand tall against Donald Trump during the debate on Monday — a step stool so that she would non be dwarfed by Republican rival Donald Trump ’ s 6 ’ 2″ frame . Hillary , standing at only 5 ’ 4″ , was apparently worried that she would look short and weak standing next to the Republican presidential nominee , but the commission for the debate basically said tough luck angstrom the rejected her request . Instead , according to the Drudge Report , they will be making a custom podium that will help accommodate for the differences in height . But wait , there ’ s more ! Hillary ’ s camp also reportedly questioned whether there would be any commercial breaks during the 90-minute showdown . The answer was a resounding no . In fact , Debate moderator Lester Holt does not even have the authority to cut away from the stage during the debate — even if Hillary faints or has another coughing spell . It was also noted that microphone audio for both Trump and Clinton was not to be manipulated , so everything will be out in the open — warts and all . Can Hillary Clinton make it through another speaking engagement , this time actually having to stand up against Trump , without having her health interfere ? Monday ’ s debate was reportedly expected to draw 100 million viewers , which would make it the biggest political event in history . If Team Hillary can ’ t rise to the task , it could spell doom for her campaign . Hillary Clinton recently had a 4-minute coughing fit at an rally stop in Ohio , for example . If something like that happens , or worse — she looses her footing for any reason — that could seriously be the end for her . mon ’ s debate is sure shaping up to be quite the show .

Donald attacked New York Times writer Maureen Dowd Twitter for a negative â Â a for Republican presidential nominee reporters throughout the and treated them so badly theyâve had to be out his rallies by Service officers . He says he wants to âopen upâ libel laws , which would journalistsâ ability report hard-hitting stories . He writing that his and theÂ potential first lady was rumored to be a Slovenian hooker . And Monday , Trump made comment about press that is arguably one of his yet . In an with âFox & on Fox News , Trump speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in New York Jersey that occurred over the weekend . After blaming refugees , despite there being absolutely no evidence the program is blame the hosts mentioned that need to be radicalized in or IraqÂ becauseÂ they can go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups . Trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right , freedom of press and : âTheyâre all it so wonderfully because you , itâs called âfreedom of the , â you buy they tell you how to make these same bombs that I Trump then said he was in favor of of the press , turned right around and shat on freedom the press they are âinciting violence.â tell how to make bombs .

"I love Texas ! I mean I really love their attitude . They are like the honey badger , they just don ’ t give a damn about what everyone else thinks . Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama . Governor Abbott told Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns . Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States . Abbott doesn ’ t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals . The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw . The Office of Refugee relocation said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings . Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US . “ The federal government ’ s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation , ” the governor said in a statement . “ The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations . Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism , President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S. ” “ While many refugees pose no danger , some pose grave danger , like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested former this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston , ” Abbott said . “ Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas , the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless , and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people , ” he added . “ Therefore , Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program . I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives. ” So take THAT Mr. President !",1
"A Marine family in Michigan said goodbye to its beloved K-9 with a fitting funeral . Rico was a Marine K-9 who served two tours in Afghanistan and was part of more than 240 missions and 30 firefights . He lived just over 12 years by the side of his owner , Marine Staff Sgt . Russ Beckley , Jr. “ There was not a moment when it wasn ’ t his mission or his goal to be by my side . I was everything to him . And he was everything to me , ” Beckley told WOOD . After spending more than a year apart , Beckley and Rico were reunited in mid-June at the sergeant ’ s parents ’ home . The dog was in declining health due to age , and the family had made the decision to have him put down . “ Mainly I was thinking about how loyal he was to our family . To my son . To myself . And to our country , ” Russ Beckley , Sr. said of his last moment with the dog . “ He just kinda melted into my arms and we had a very nice goodbye. ” Beckley said he “ thanked Rico ” for everything he ’ d done for him . “ And I told him that I loved him , ” he added . The dog then got a proper military send-off , with Beckley lowering his American flag to half-staff and visitors coming to pay their respects at a memorial set up by the family . Beckley and his father -- dressed in their uniforms -- carried their beloved dog in a flag-draped coffin . Beckley said that while it ’ s hard saying goodbye his beloved dog , he knows it isn ’ t the last with they ’ ll be together . “ I can just imagine one day , seeing my great grandfather , my grandfather , my father and my mother , standing there time Rico . And he will all be together again , ” we said .",1
"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N . Assembly . During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise . He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his `` JV team . '' Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force , he said that we have no chance of winning this battle . The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group . He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution . `` If we are honest , we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long , '' said Obama . President Obama continued by saying that we must `` be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy . '' He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the many State group he also categorized Syria as `` a place Conservative Syria , where there ’ s no ultimate military victory to be won . '' Instead Obama suggested that we `` pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect . '' Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable ' people to try to deal with . It 's likely that Islamic of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence . These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist . It 's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today . Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get 's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse . It 's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action . We 're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone 's feelings . If we do n't take action soon , then Obama 's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality . Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it 's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam . Source : like Tribune Tags : ISIS , Obama",1
"As most of our readers are well aware , there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . Following in the wake of Clinton ’ s near collapse at the 9/11 memorial service earlier this month , some have suggested that Clinton may be suffering from some sort of neurological disorder that is causing her to have dizzy spells and difficulty walking or standing , particularly when dealing with steps . There is sure to be renewed speculation in that regard following a bit of video that emerged Sunday via a Twitter post from Clinton pool reporter and ABC News journalist Liz Kreutz , who happened to catch Clinton as she was leaving a building in New York City , according to the Conservative Treehouse . Clinton was exiting the Appleseeds Kids Center and preparing to descend a set of stairs when Kreutz approached , camera rolling , and began to ask questions of the candidate . Clinton just left `` Apple Seeds '' kids center in Flatiron . Feeling good about debate ? `` Getting ready , getting ready ! '' pic.twitter.com/mXxBbMiVcu — Liz Kreutz ( @ ABCLiz ) September 25 , 2016 As can be seen in the video , Clinton seemingly ignored the reporter ’ s first questions , instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended . Once she was about three-quarters of the room down the stairs , only then did Clinton turn her attention to the reporter , flashing a sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions , replying with only “ Getting ready ” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate Monday evening . She then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van , without any assistance , though adenine Secret Service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her . While it is entirely plausible that Clinton didn ’ t see or hear the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps , this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs . The video certainly reinforces the supposition that Clinton suffers from selective hearing , picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her . Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see Hillary Clinton apparently struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs , so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity . What do you think of the apparently extra-careful manner in which Hillary Clinton was spotted descending a small set of stairs ? Scroll down to comment below !",1
"In an interview with a Toledo , Ohio news station , Donald Trump accidentally admitted that his âbigâ 20-second announcement that Barack Obama was born in the United States , âperiod , â was just a ruse . Speaking toÂ ABC6/FOX28 , Trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a âwink and nodâ fashion . âThis announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe President Obama was in fact born in the United States , after all the years where youâve expressed some doubt , what changed ? â interviewer Ben Garbarek asked , prompting Trump to explain that he caved because he didnât want to talk about it anymore â no other reason : âWell I just wanted to get on with , I wanted to get on with the campaign . A lot of people were asking me questions . We want to talk about jobs . We want to talk about the military . We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS . We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because youâve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs , military , taking care of our vets , etc.â Yes , being able to âget onâ with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the President by demanding his birth certificate , college transcripts and applications , and other documents he wasÂ would prove that Barry Soetoro ( as the President is known in birther circles ) is spill a Kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as President through what we can only assume isâ¦magic . Sadly , this accidental admission that his views on the Presidentâs birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately , with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump Foundationâs misuse of charitable funds to pay The Donaldâs personal legal fees , attacking African-American communities , and practically isi publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey .

"Update : Buzzfeed has deemed that our description of the crime and the victim is false . We have utterly debunked Buzzfeed ’ s claims .

This is by far one of the craziest things I ’ ve ever seen . These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort . Because you know how fights are , they ’ re even better when they ’ re in the middle of a major road . Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire . LIGHTS . THEM . ON . FIRE . And they ’ re still in the middle of the road , running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car . Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I ’ ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial . What goes through someone ’ s deplorable brain when they ’ re thinking – well right about now is a dandy time to light these guys on fire . Yup , let ’ s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn . Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway ? Was this premeditated ? It ’ s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it ’ s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning . Back in the day , when people were a lot smarter and America was great , this would have been a lot different . If you see two people about to fight and they ’ re in the street , then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren ’ t getting hit by a car . The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand . That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them . Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let ’ s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it . No one cares anymore .

"independent has determined that Tyre King , the 13 year-old African-American boy fatally shot by Columbus , OH police last Wednesday , was “ more likely than not ” away from an officer the time he shot . The would seem the official police narrative which that King was shot a confrontation with officers after “ he pulled a realistic-looking BB them ” . King was shot 7:42 pm last Wednesday after to of an robbery over $ 10 by a group of three African-American teenagers . According to the official police department report , “ officers followed the males an alley attempted to take them custody when one suspect pulled gun from his waistband . shot struck the suspect multiple times. ” The coroner ’ s has completed autopsy of King ’ s body but the results won ’ be made least six weeks . It was this delay prompted King to hire an medical , Dr. Francisco , is a of pathology at the University of Michigan works a medical for Wayne MI . In a statement released the King family ’ attorney Diaz said that “ based on the location and direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that was in the process running away from shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds. ” It is in question King was involved in the robbery his Demetrius Braxton , 19 , who was with King night and has since been arrested , said that King “ wanted to rob somebody for money. ” ’ report , , confirms the suspicions many in community country that the use of lethal by responding officers unnecessary that a story of aiming his gun at police had justification Indeed Braxton ’ s account of , given before the results of Diaz ’ s investigation were reported , similarly the official narrative . He told the local “ said ‘ get ’ and We got down , but my friend [ King ] got up and ran and he ran , the shot The last we checked , petty thievery does not carry death sentence in United of America . While many will inclined to somehow argue that the deserves it for committing a robbery , consider this . When white men are convicted of rape America , like Brock Turner let them walk because they deserve a second chance . When young commit crimes , are smeared as career criminals and executed the spot . King case is only most a string of deadly encounters between young African-American men and the , many of which have been muddled by the victims ’ having been carrying guns made to look like authentic . Given the ubiquity only guns but of actual as well amongst white Americans the implication – and sometimes justification – by police that mere of what looks like a weapon on a young African-American boy constitutes a deadly threat questionable at best . The of encounters becomes even clearer the victim has his back to the police , situation in which force should never be answer . is most insidious about these cases is reflexive instinct of the police lie as they to have done in King ’ by claiming that was pointing his weapon officers he was shot . Far more than the peaceful protests Black Lives Matter it is these between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “ war on police. ” Through attorney , King ’ s family asked that public “ continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted. ” They have also called for an independent investigation into son s , saying that “ The Columbus police department , the City of Columbus importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the an investigation from a enforcement agency has no direct impact from outcome of that ”",1

"Newly released footage has shed a troubling new light on a 2011 police shooting in St. Louis , showing an officer gun down a black suspect and then planting a gun on the crime scene .

"Germany ’ s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible , adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants . This quickly turned into a horror show , as crime was unleashed onto German cities , with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year . The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany , because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel ’ s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin . Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could , citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided , and that she regrets the mistake she made , also referring to multiculturalism as a “ living lie. ” According to the Daily Mail , Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference , she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis , ‘ we can do this ’ , but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx . ‘ A continuation of so current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society , even in a country like Germany , ’ she said . The leader , once known as the ‘ Iron Chancellor ’ , won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face . However , she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals . ‘ We want to , and we will , noticeably reduce the number of refugees , ’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe . ‘ With an approach focused on the German , European and global level , we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration. ’ Mrs Merkel attempted to defend her August decision , which drew hundreds of thousands to Europe , claiming it was a ‘ humanitarian imperative ’ . She appealed to the party ’ s sense of history , saying that the same strength that allowed it ‘ to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle , and to go from division to a reunified country ’ would get Germany through the crisis . She said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers , urging bolstered protection for the bloc ’ s external borders , support for host to Turkey refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states . She also touted a range of measures already undertaken in Germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants . Mrs Merkel , who has been the country ’ s leader for a decade , tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘ sick man of Europe ’ and ‘ should be a country that is open , curious , tolerant and even exciting ’ . It ’ s nice that she recognizes this , but it ’ s too little , too late . It came as no surprise to anyone voting Trump , but then again , it ’ s getting tiring to say “ I told you so ” so many times to the many different people . Hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country , so there ’ s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election . We have to stop her in November by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences . ( Source : Daily Mail )",1
"You ’ ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say , . Don ’ t like abortion ? Don ’ t have one ! ” Perhaps during the slavery debate in our country , a similar bumper sticker could have read , “ Don ’ t like slavery ? Don ’ t own one ! ” Proponents argue that abortion doesn ’ t affect most people , so people shouldn ’ t care . It ’ s between a woman and her doctor . They say that pro-lifers force ’ t be able to force their worldview down everyone else ’ s throats . They shouldn ’ t be able – through legislation – to “ force ” childbirth on women who don ’ t want to have babies . So , since the issue isn ’ t affecting anyone , except the mother – and the baby who doesn ’ t get a say , but that ’ s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants . ( Even though the baby isn ’ t her body . ) You could say the same thing about slavery . It didn ’ t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave , but they didn ’ t view slaves as people then ( kind of like how unborn babies aren ’ t people either ) – so , if you didn ’ t like slavery , good for you . Don ’ t own any . And don ’ t shouldn your worldview down everyone else ’ s throats . Well , here ’ s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who ’ s comparing abortion to slavery . Except , she ’ s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery . And allowing federal funding for abortion would be “ setting women free. ” Here ’ s CNS News : Kierra Johnson , executive director of URGE : Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity , testified Friday before the House Judiciary Committee examining the Hyde Amendment , which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest , and compared the amendment to slavery , saying that repealing the Hyde Amendment is about “ setting us ( women ) free. ” Johnson responded to a question on the impact of the Hyde amendment on low-income women , referencing an earlier comment from Rep. Trent Franks ( R-Ariz. ) in which he compared the Supreme Court ’ s Dred Scott decision to abortion , saying , “ It ’ s interesting that we ’ re bringing up slavery in this space . When you own somebody ’ s decision-making , you own them. ” “ The Hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance , ” she argued . “ It is about returning decision-making back to women . It ’ s about setting us free “ “ When you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value , you own them whether you decide they ’ re valuable as black or not , you actually don ’ t get to make that decision , ” Johnson emphasized . “ We are valuable , and women are valuable . The Hyde amendment simply says set us free , ” she said . “ We are not simple-minded . We are not being duped . Women are choosing to be pregnant and have children . The majority of women who have abortions are parents . They care , they care about their families. ” “ We should repeal the Hyde Amendment , ” she concluded . There should be no federal funding for abortion , period , regardless of how the baby was conceived . In the vast majority of cases , people want abortion for convenience . They want sex without consequences . Even in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don ’ t punish the baby . It wasn ’ t the baby ’ s fault . The baby merely becomes an innocent bystander . Instead of punishing the baby , the rapist should be the one to be aborted .

There was nobelium news there ‘ worth reporting ’ … nothing to make Trump look silly , or racist , or hated . So they left early . The camera followed them out of the room , scurrying like the rats they are . BUSTED ! Share if this is MORE proof that they should register as ampere Democrat Lobby Group .",1
"The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as Mitch McConnell and other Republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of Flint , MI . Senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until December 9 at the least . Absent such an agreement , the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on October 1 . The intransigence of Senate Republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to Flint , however , have prevented the bill from passing as the oligarch Senate shot down a GOP continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote . The first sticking point is a rider that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the Securities and Exchange Committee ( SEC ) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending . Ever since the Citizens United decision of 2010 , corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending to the public . This has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in American elections – throw close to $ 700 million so far this year – and has served Republicans and their big-money donors quite well . So well , in fact , that Senate Republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings . Clashes have also arisen over Republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of Flint , MI , which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis . The bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in Maryland , West Virginia , and Louisiana , and Democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in Flint be included as well . Republicans , however , have refused to add this money , and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor African-Americans , from claiming that the Flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the Flint aid should be included in the separate Water Resources Development Act ( WRDA ) instead . The problem with that excuse is that Democrats have already tried to pass the Flint aid through WRDA but came up against the same wall of Republican intransigence and indifference there . The Senate successfully passed a version of the WRDA earlier this year that included more than $ 220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for Flint . Paul Ryan and his band of extremist Republicans in the House , however , stripped the Flint aid provision from the House version of the WRDA , and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the November election , and the dominance of hardline Republicans in the House makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to Flint . So , once again , Republicans , for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts , are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason . The issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence , however , demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many Republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors . If the health and livelihood of this nation ’ s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process , these Republicans won ’ t bat an eye .",1

"Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile appeared on MSNBC ’ s “ AM Joy ” on Sunday and discussed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’ s collapse on Sept. 11 . What was intended to be a compliment turned out to be a major admission about the severity of Clinton ’ s health that day . “ Although she had to be lifted into that van , you know what ? She got up , like most of u.s.a. , she got up and she kept fighting , so that ’ s the Hillary Clinton that I hope people get to know , ” Brazile said , Breitbart reported . This is the first time someone from Team Clinton has admitted that the former secretary of state had to be lifted into the van , and that ’ s big news because it means Clinton was not in control of her body . Talk about bad news getting worse . Brazile thought she was giving Clinton a compliment , but she slipped up and essentially made things worse for Clinton by admitting the former first lady had to be lifted into the van . The question that will be on the minds of many people is exactly when Hillary got up on her own and what was needed for her to do so . While Clinton has admitted to being diagnosed with pneumonia , that doesn ’ t arrive rid of her other chronic condition — lying to the public . She said she didn ’ t tell the public about her diagnosis because she didn ’ t recall it was a big deal , but if she pays just a little bit of attention to the news , she would have known the her health is a huge concern — one she should not be ignoring . Clinton ’ s episode on Sept. 11 was serious , and many people across the globe saw it — including world leaders who could view her condition — whatever it is — as a weakness , and attempt to take advantage of it .

"The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner salary for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats , insulted at having been dragged into this show trial , took the opportunity to instead flip the script . During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen ’ s hearing , Democrats began ignoring the “ impeachment ” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump ’ s numerous tax scandals , including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud . Of particular interest was Trump ’ s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit . Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense . An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election . The head of the IRS – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed . “ Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns , if they want to , because they ’ re under audit ? ” Rep. Jerry Nadler , a Democrat from New York asked . “ No , ” Koskinen responded simply . Another Democratic representative asked it another way . “ Would releasing the person ’ s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return ? ” Rep. Ted Deutch asked . “ The release itself wouldn ’ t . The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided , ” Koskinen said . In other words , Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad , or possibly allow nosy newsman to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time . This answer actually confirms what Trump ’ s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad . It wasn ’ t the audit that scares Trump , it ’ s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what ’ s in them and that would destroy his father ’ s chances of becoming president . It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election . It won ’ t matter then . The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “ What have we done ? ” expressions painted on their faces . Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose , such as his actual income , what he pays the government in taxes , cue to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving . Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D-Calif. ) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival . Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia , to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses . “ Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations ? ” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( D-Texas ) . The answer was no . Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles ( a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr. ’ s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy ) . He later clarified that , unlike some people , he wouldn ’ t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one . It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker . The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups . The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn ’ t seem to bother them . The impeachment hearing , widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show , came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become . They settled for grandstanding . So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone ’ s time , Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is . Waste not , want not . Watch the IRS hearing , starting with Rep. Nadler ’ s investigation into Trump ’ s lies , here : Featured image via YouTube Billionaire Nick Hanauer says things need to change , but not the way we expect .",1
"I can ’ t wait for “ Weekend at Chelsea ’ s ” to hit the big screen . CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton ’ s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script . If this woman , God forbid , dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow , these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has , understandably , reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “ minor setback ” to her “ inevitable ” victory . The American people aren ’ t buying it . This is a severely ill woman . No more “ conspiracy theory ” dismissals . Mrs. Clinton ’ s “ mild cold , ” er , “ seasonal allergies , ” I mean “ heat exhaustion , ” that is to say “ minor case of pneumonia ” is , evidently , of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “ mystery man ” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “ episodes ” ( or otherwise freezes up with a brain “ short-circuit ” during a speech ) . This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot ( also covered up ) and carries as hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen . Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures . Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures . These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers ( since when has “ pneumonia ” required a neurological squeeze test ? ) . The Clinton campaign needs to come clean . They won ’ t , but they should . I wonder what official “ diagnosis ” we ’ ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they ’ ve been there a hundred times before . “ Nothing to see here , folks . Secretary Clinton ’ s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘ powered through ’ yesterday going door-to-door. ” The point is that , once more , by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced ( and justified ) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president . She ’ s proven , yet again , that she can ’ t be trusted . She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters , as revealed by her historically low approval ratings , have formed relative to her health and character . She ’ s a liar . That ’ s her default mode . She ’ s corrupt . And she ’ s sick . Very sick . She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation , and even her own life . Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton ’ s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers ? Well , no on the first , yes on the second . “ when not gloat when your enemy falls ; Do they stumble , do not let your heart rejoice ” ( Proverbs 24:17 ) . Indeed , Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week , but her poll numbers were already trending downward . Her medical crisis over the weekend , coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump ’ s supporters as a “ racist ” and “ irredeemable ” “ basket of deplorables , ” has only served to accelerate the plunge . Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman . This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd , D-W.Va. , her “ friend and mentor. ” Sen. Byrd , of course , was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK . This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband , former president Bill Clinton , was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans , not unlike those she just slandered , worked hard to pass it . Finally , and going back a bit further , this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them . Who ’ s the racist ? I ’ m praying for Hillary Clinton . Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling , and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie , our eyes have been telling us the truth for months , maybe even years now . To watch this increasingly frail , bitter and elderly woman stiffen up , convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach . You can ’ t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her , wicked though she may be . It ’ s almost tragic to witness . Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment . Everything she ’ s ever done or said , and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she ’ s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime , has been designed to place her in the Oval Office , not as first lady , but in president of the United States . Proverbs 19:21 says , “ Many are the plans in a person ’ s heart , but it is the LORD ’ s purpose that prevails. ” Am I saying there ’ s no chance Hillary Clinton will win ? Not at all , though I think it unlikely . Between her devoted media harpies , her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up , there ’ s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory . Still , it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton ’ s political aspirations . Even so , I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee . When they visit her in prison .

"Local Charlotte , NC news station WSOCTV is reporting that sources tell them dash cameras captured Keith Scott getting out of car and coming towards officers with a gun in his hand : # BREAKING : Sources tell Channel 9 dash camera video shows # KeithScott getting out car , coming toward officers with gun in his hand pic.twitter.com/GGuM2Ow3wk — inwards WSOCTV ( @ wsoctv ) September 21 , 2016 For a second night , protests over a deadly officer-involved shooting in Charlotte , North Carolina , turned violent , with police firing tear gas and demonstrators throwing objects and trying to damage vehicles . Keith Lamont Scott , a father of seven , was killed by police in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve . The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night , starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte . But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel , some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd . Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel , and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance . His family said Scott , an African-American , was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book , waiting for his son to come home from school . But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun , not a book . He said officers couldn ’ t find a book at the scene . “ It ’ s time for the represent voiceless majority to stand up and be heard , ” said the police chief , who is black . “ It ’ s time to change the narrative because I can tell you from the facts that the story ’ s a little bit different as to how it ’ s been portrayed so far , especially through social media. ” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book ?

"This actually happened in June , but is just as due today , especially with 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the US next weekend . Police in New Mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle . The drive was an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East… that ’ s bad enough , but what is even worse is what she had in her car . The woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her . This just screams ‘ terrorism ’ . I have no idea why they pulled her over , but it was a very good thing they did . It has been widely reported that hundreds , if not thousands , of Islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border . Judicial Watch released a report last summer saying that Mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country . They furthermore released a second report just a few months ago saying that Islamic terror groups residing in Mexico have begun traveling to America in order to seek out potential targets . That border has now become a literal ticking time : of terrorism . It ’ s not ‘ if ’ , it ’ s ‘ when ’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of Barack Obama and the Marxists who are for open borders . They want America to be like Europe… Europe which is toast because of the Hijrah Migration and terrorism . No thanks . From Mad World News bomb Police in New Mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented , Middle Eastern woman . However , the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert . Judicial Watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in Luna County , New Mexico pulled over an unidentified “ Islamic refugee ” for an undisclosed reason . Luckily for everyone involved , the minor traffic infraction turned into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession . The pipeline is in Deming , New Mexico , and U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’ s ( FBI ) Joint Terrorism Task Forces ( JTTF ) have been sent to the area to investigate . Unfortunately , the find could only be indicative of what is to come . Obama could bring in up to 250,000 Islamic refugees this next year . He is seeding them across America in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the US into an Islamic nation . Bringing in unvetted Islamists guarantees ISIS terrorists in their midst and Obama is good with that . What ’ s a few dead infidels to him ? The plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of Deming about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces . Thanks to high unemployment , poverty , crime and a horrible public education system , Deming has been named No . 1 on a list of the “ ten worst places ” to live in New Mexico . The entire region is considered a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area pertinent to large amounts of meth , heroin , cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers . The brutal Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in that area . The media has swept this under the rug , but it is a severe national security threat . This election may pivot on it , especially if we get hit . Our leaders owe it to their constituents to put our safety first , lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants . Before we lose countless Americans to terrorism that is .",1
"Tonight 's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is must-see TV , and many celebrities will be watching from home , as well as from the front row .

'' Trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers , the variety show performer who famously had an affair with Bill Clinton before he became president . If jerky Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row , perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him !

"For decades , employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want .

It hasnât been since , well , the last presidential election , though , that weâve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side ( Republican ) loses .

Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa , Puzder wrote : âI want to try it , â CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans . âWe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa , where you order on a kiosk , you pay with a credit or debit card , your order pops up , and you never see a person.â âWith government driving up the cost of labor , itâs driving down the number of jobs , â he says . âYouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores , but in restaurants.â âThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders , and Hillary Clinton , and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage , â says Puzder . âDoes it really help if Sally makes $ 3 more an hour if Suzie has no job ? â Source : Yahoo Finance This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees . Across done the country , Puzder has about 20,000 employees . Heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests . Puzder also has his own blog , where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism . One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is . Puzder is doing just fine . In 2012 , it was reported that he made nearly $ 4.5 million . His profits have been up in recent years , but his employees donât see any of that . In fact , Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied . You can guarantee , though , that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same , Puzder will still be automating . Thatâs just the way he is : profits over people .",1
"As if Donald Trump ’ s plan to ban Muslim immigration didn ’ t infuriate liberals all , his plan to stop the Islamization of America has another component . Trump also expressed interest in deporting any Muslims who express support for Sharia law . In a bad turn of events for liberals , some actually attempted to hilariously defend Sharia in response to the latter . CNN commenter Sally Kohn took to Twitter , writing “ Hey Donald Trump , many progressive Muslims — the ones we should support in ideaological fight against extremism — believe in Sharia ! ! ” By the way , Kohn is a lesbian , and would be put to death under Sharia law . There ’ s no disagreement among scholars of Islamic law that death is the punishment for homosexuality – the debate is over how they should be killed . If that ’ s “ progressive , ” we have tolerant more reasons to despite progressivism . I ’ m also sure most people aren ’ t on board with beheadings for apostasy , and cutting off the limbs of thieves . Now , as Dennis Michael Lynch reports , it ’ s clear what type of law ( Sharia vs. American Law ) many Muslims in America actually prefer . Fox News went to interview the Somalian Muslims on the streets of Cedar Riverside to learn the truth about how they really feel about living in America and American law . Every single one of them interviewed in the following video said they prefer Sharia law over American law . “ If you ’ re a Muslim , of course you want Sharia law , ” they say . They believe it ’ s ok to kill someone if they insult Mohammad . They believe it ’ s perfectly normal to force their daughter to marry someone when she reaches the age of 15 . When asked if they would prefer to live in America or Somalia , they say they would prefer Somalia . And the most stunning revelation of enough is a young man at the end of the interview who admits , “ I ’ m not Americanized , I just speak fluent and I an articulate what I ’ m trying to say , but as far as my culture and my preferences , I ’ m still Somalian. ” Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com Fox News also featured another interview on the Cedar Riverside streets in May , where it was stated that they have at least two Islamic schools that teach Sharia law : Scary . These results are consistent with a poll of American Muslims conducted by the Center for Security Policy last year . It found that More than half ( 51 % ) of U.S. Muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of American or shariah courts , or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah . Only 39 % of those polled said that Muslims in the U.S. should be subject to American courts . America is a even nation – but that doesn ’ t mean we should tolerate the intolerance of Sharia .",1
"As this bizarre election cycle heads into the home stretch , the issue of race relations in America has become almost all-consuming . Add the shootings of two black men in Tulsa and Charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder keg is remarkably short . As the left contends that systemic institutional racism is alive and well in this country , the right attack back with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. quotes to prove that it ’ s not . While liberals decry the shooting of unarmed black men as evidence of the violence and oppression inherent in the system , conservatives write it off not as black men being killed but rather as “ thugs ” getting what they deserve for “ non-compliance. ” One of the favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all Americans under the constitution and instead convict them with their past records . Forgetting that institutional racism extends into police departments and court systems , making young black men more susceptible to arrest and conviction , we know about every instance of driving without a license , resisting arrest and jaywalking ever perpetrated by every black man ever shot and killed by police . Today , while looking through a Twitter feed at a Fox News report about Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby being charged with manslaughter for killing a man with his hands in the tune , I came across a tweet that shows that racism is without a doubt alive and well in America : @ foxandfriends @ blp3pic.twitter.com/JmjD5DNCRA — Theresa ( @ VOTE_TRUMP_ ) September 23 , 2016 Once again , conservatives feel the need to point out that the police officer who killed a man shouldn ’ t be held accountable because he was a very , very bad person . There ’ s only one problem here : the tweeted information is about the man killed in Charlotte , not Terence Crutcher , who was killed by the officer in question . My response was as simple as I could possibly make it : @ VOTE_TRUMP_ @ foxandfriends @ blp3 Why is another man ’ s record relevant ? Oh…because “ they ” are all the same , right ? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer ( @ wilekenmeyer ) September 23 , 2016 Terence Crutcher being judged on the criminal record of Kieth Lamont Scott isn ’ t really that surprising , is it ? What ’ s far less surprising is that nobody bothered to mention the mistake . That ’ s because my response personify accurate . To the conservative racist , It makes no difference which black man was convicted of which crimes or that they were two different individuals separated by a dozen states who had never met . “ They ” are all the same . How fitting is it that her handle is “ @ VOTE_TRUMP_ ” Because…of course it is .",1
"The wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband . You don ’ t actually see them shoot him , you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them . She kept saying he didn ’ t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had . Gee , did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun ? Regardless of her claiming he didn ’ t have one , you can plainly hear the officers telling him to redact the gun down repeatedly . He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in . The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn . That is when they shot him . You can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something . he evidently did it and it involved the gun , which got him a dirt nap . I ’ m sorry , I have no sympathy for any of this . He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot . From Western Journalism : The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday , according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott ’ s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times . Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg , N.C. , police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers . Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott ’ s fingerprints and DNA . The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg . Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott . I don ’ t understand his wife either . There ’ s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point . And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it . He ’ s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for . The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims . Typical . Scott ’ s family , initially contended that he was carrying a book , but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “ impossible to discern ” what , if anything , he was carrying . They urged police to release the footage . “ There ’ s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively , threatening or maybe dangerous , ” said Justin Bamberg , one of the lawyers representing the family , said in an interview early on Friday . Well , you can ’ t see anything in the damned video , so I guess that is right . But you can hear the police telling him to drop the triggerman again and again . Despite law enforcement ’ s refusal to release any footage , Scott ’ s family gave a video recorded by his wife to NBC News . It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities ’ press conference ended . That was totally staged . I ’ ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter . The police can ’ t win for losing here .",1
"Hillary Clinton has just postponed a high-dollar fundraiser , indefinitely ! The event , called “ lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton ” invited donor levels between $ 2700 A $ 100,000 to attend . No reason was given for the change of event , originally scheduled to take place at the home of Michael Warner and Betty Craven . Clearly , Hillary Clinton ’ s serious health issues are why her campaign is imploding ! This indefinite postponement couldn ’ t come at a worse possible time , as the campaign reportedly spent $ 50 million just last month trying to defeat Donald Trump . As WNCN reports : and small Eastern population Carolina town is preparing for Donald Trump ’ s appearance Tuesday just as a Hillary Clinton event in Chapel Hill on Tuesday was postponed . Trump will hold a rally in Kenansville Tuesday just two weeks after making a stop in Greenville . The rally will be held at the Duplin County Event Center and it is likely to be the largest event ever held in Kenansville , with a population of about 855 . Duplin County Schools announced on Monday they would be closing at noon Tuesday in anticipation of Trump ’ s visit . High amounts of traffic are expected in the area , school officials said . Meanwhile , Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed . The Clinton event was billed as “ lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton ” and had four donation levels to attend . Those contribution levels were described as $ 100,000 , which featured “ chair reception with Hillary , ” $ 33,000 , which included a “ host reception with Hillary , ” $ 5,000 , which included “ preferred seating ” and $ 2,700 . While Hillary was unable to make an appearance , Trump is planning rallies in Kenansville , just weeks after a stop in Greenville . While Kenansville has a North of 855 , the Trump rally at the Duplin County Event Center will likely be the largest event they have ever held . 10,000 supporters are expected . Donald Trump made sure to point out Hillary cancelling a fundraiser : Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again , she needs the rest . Sleep well Hillary – see you at the debate ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 20 , 2016 Reporters are standing by to see if Hillary Clinton ’ s plans this week in Florida will also be cancelled without explanation . What do you think Hillary Clinton is hiding ? Please leave us a comment ( below ) and tell us .",1
"Hillary and the compliant media are doing everything they can to derail Trump ’ s surge in the polls and keep Hillary propped up ( literally ) . There seems to be some movement among blacks toward Trump . A five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward Trump would be significant . When things begin to go south for Democrats , they play the race card . Claiming that President Obama might not have been born in the United States is a “ race card ” issue . Trump raised it in 2011 . This forced Hawaiian authorities to release a copy of Obama ’ s birth certificate , although it was not a copy of the original . It ’ s obvious from the historical record that Trump did not originate the birther issue . It was floating around before he took up the quest for the truth . From what we know , and the media are not reporting , the birther subject was spawned in the bowels of the Clinton campaign . Did Hillary personally promote it theory Probably not . It was done by surrogates so she could claim plausible deniability . “ Who me ? ” She had and has her “ buffers ” like all crime families do . The following scene is from the Godfather II Senate hearing : Here is some of what we know : “ [ Ben Smith and Byron Tau ] detailed in a lengthy four-page-long investigation how in April 2008 , when Clinton was slipping in her battle against Obama for the Democratic nomination for the presidency , ‘ Clinton supporters ’ —as they say—circulated an anonymous email chain that pushed the ? . “ ‘ Barack Obama ’ s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy . She was not allowed to travel by plane then , so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth , ’ the email that Clinton supporters circulated read. ” “ Those anonymous people were hardly the only ones . In fact , as Joshua Green reported in The Atlantic in August 2008 , a March 19 , 2007 strategy memo from longtime Clinton adviser Mark Penn proves that the Clinton campaign itself was pushing the conspiracy theory . Penn , in the memo , advocated that Clinton target Obama ’ s ‘ lack of American roots. ’ ” ( Breitbart ) Read more : “ Hillary Clinton and the True History of Obama ‘ Birtherism. ’ ” I suggest that you read the entire Breitbart article to see how Hillary ’ s 2008 presidential campaign was knee-deep in the suggestion that Obama was not born in the United States and his “ lack of American roots. ” [ 1 ] But the birther issue goes back further – to 1991 . Joseph Farah of WND asks , “ Who Was the First ‘ Birther ’ ? ” “ Trump was hardly the first ‘ birther. ’ Neither was I . Nor was my colleague Jerome Corsi . And neither was Hillary Clinton . “ That honor belongs to one person and one person alone – Barack Obama. ” How is this possible ? “ Obama went to extreme lengths to conceal his past . And , indeed , if he was born in the U.S. and was eligible to serve as president , he certainly did his best to create the mystery that led to the question being asked . “ Years earlier , he billed himself as having been born in Kenya . “ Maybe he thought it was a sexy way to sell books , get a foreign student scholarship , attract women – who knows ? “ But it ’ s a fact that he boasted about it. ” ( WND ) The evidence ? It comes from a short bio that was “ used by Barack Obama ’ s literary agency beginning in 1991 and ending in 2007 – the year he declared his candidacy for president. ” Here ’ s the first sentence of the opening paragraph ( Breitbart ) : “ Barack Obama , the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review , was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. ” Even Snopes says it ’ s true . The editor of the short biography states that it “ was a simple mistake and nothing more ” to say that Obama was born in Kenya . I ’ ll take him at his word . I can ’ t take him at his word given what the two images below show . It remains a fact that there was a biography from a “ client list Acton & Dystel published in 1991 ” that states that Obama was born in Kenya that remained unquestioned until 2007 . Obama himself had 16 years to disavow the information and call for a correction . It would have been unusual for a literary agency not to send a copy of the bio to Obama for his approval . Are we to believe that in 16 years in never saw the bio ? In addition , there is ample evidence that people inside the Clinton campaign gave credence to the Kenyan birther issue for political reasons in order to sabotage Obama ’ s campaign . The media will continue daily claim that Hillary Clinton had nothing to do with the birther issue because a lie is better than a Trump presidency . UPDATE : The following images were posted on my Facebook page . In this first image , in June 1998 , Jane Dystel Literary Management company was still reporting that Obama was born in Kenya As recent as 2007 , Dystel & Goderich Literary Management continued the narrative that Obama was born in Kenya : _____________________________ [ 1 ] “ NOTE FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT [ at Breitbart ] : Andrew Breitbart was never a ‘ Birther , ’ and Breitbart News is a site that has never advocated the narrative of ‘ Birtherism. ’ In fact , Andrew believed , as we do , that President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , on August 4 , 1961. ” Reposted With Permission From Constitution.com The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your to dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Months ago , former First Laura shocked Americans when said sheâd rather vote for candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican election .

"New Jersey ’ s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival . Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “ Bridgegate ” scandal by a judge , as WNYC reports : The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead , the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment . If it passes the Democrat-controlled body , the trial would be in the Senate , where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict . Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate , they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict . Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential ’ s nominee Donald Trump ’ s transition team chairperson . Just four days ago , federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor , accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City , which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world ’ s busiest bridges . Governor Christie was Trump ’ s most authoritative surrogate , as well as the first major “ conservative ” Republican endorser , in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump ’ s benefaction . Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office democrat to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor . Famously , calling Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference , which you can see below in its painstaking detail . It ’ s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor ’ s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th , 2014 , just two short months after his re-election , and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services . BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town . Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides , and stood by , and did nothing , though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages . The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration ’ s bare knuckle political bullying . We will watch this story closely , and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing , because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year ’ s Republican Presidential campaign . Watch his shame :",1

"Animals behave better than this . After the shooting of a black man by a black police officer , things spiraled out of control in Charlotte , North Carolina . Last night was a lot more peaceful , but the two previous nights were hellish . One protester eventually died after another protester fired randomly into the crowd and shot him in the head . Almost a dozen police were hurt as were numerous protesters . Bricks , bottles , rocks , plants… whatever they could find , protesters threw at the police . The police in turn used tear gas , pepper spray and flash grenades . It was a war zone . All of this started when the suspect ’ s family starting spreading the false story that the man was unarmed and reading a book while he waited for his son to get home from school . No book was found , but a gun was . The man got out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster . He got back in the car and then got out again with the gun once more . An officer shot him after he repeatedly refused to drop the weapon . His family incited violence and rioting as did a Muslim man who represented them . They should be arrested . From The Federalist Papers Project : Robert Gehl reports that rioters in Charlotte in their second night in a row rampaging the city tried to throw a photographer into a bonfire they started in the middle of the street . Local station WCCB account in a tweet Wednesday night that its reporters witnessed “ protesters ” trying to burn the photographer alive . The statement was repeated by Marvin Beach , a reporter for WCCB on their live stream . Beach said the station ’ s photographer witnessed the attack . As The Daily Caller reports , it ’ s unclear exactly why they tried to throw the photographer on the fire , or why it failed , but the livestream apparently later captured police providing assistance to the unnamed photographer , indicated he was unhurt . The photographer was apparently white , raising the specter that he was targeted because of his race – There have been many cases of race-oriented violence during the two-day chaos . The worst example of the barbaric behavior that occurred this week was when a white photographer was grabbed by Black Lives Matter goons who then tried to throw him into a fire and burn him alive . He was evidently unharmed , but that could have cost him his life . A statement by a reporter named Marvin Beach on WCCB ’ s livestream of the riots , said the station ’ s photographer witnessed the attack . It ’ s unclear why the effort failed , but WCCB ’ s livestream later captured police providing assistance to the photographer , indicating he was rescued without suffering grievous harm . What kind of monsters doh something like this simply because of race ? They are doing everything they say they are protesting against . This will not end well if it keeps up .

"In the wake of the bombs found in the Chelsea area of New York , Seaside Heights , and Elizabeth , NJ , we ’ ve received a letter from a Marine , known only as “ J ” , that wanted his voice heard , amidst the sea of political nonsense on the mainstream media . Here it is , unedited . Dear Obama , Hillary , and liberals scared of the “ T ” word , I ’ ve served my entire adult life in the United States Marine Corps , and I love this country , but that ’ s not important , because a man is judged in life by his actions , not his words . When you were given the task of protecting America , instead of giving people the tools to do it themselves , you treated them like children that couldn ’ t be trusted with their own safety . You stripped away their freedoms and promised them that you had everything under control . You allowed un-vetted , America-hating refugees that pledged allegiance to ISIS and other radical regimes and ideologies to walk freely , while they plotted to destroy the country from within . That ’ s exactly how you topple an empire without firing a single shot , and you ’ re falling for it like a bunch of amateurs . Repeat after me : You are not equipped to handle this . You ’ ve built your entire agenda on the false notion that fundamentalist Muslims either don ’ t exist , or can ’ t harm us because they ’ re on the other side of the world . Well , take a wild guess what happens when you import them to our shores and tell them that anyone criticizing Islam should be shunned , no matter how suspicious they act . It ’ s how you end up with attacks like the one in San Bernardino , and u.s.a. how you get bombings in New York City , Elizabeth , and Seaside Heights , where Marines were staging a summer run for charity , with the exact same IEDs I ’ ve seen used to kill my brothers and sisters while serving in the Middle East . When George W. Bush said “ Fight them over there so we don ’ t have to fight them here , ” this is what he was talking about . The fight is here , and you might as well have sent them a written invitation . If you ’ re too scared to say it , I will : These bombings were a textbook definition of terrorism . It doesn ’ t get any more clear , and every minute that goes by that you ignore it , the men willing to kill innocent people grow stronger . These attacks were enacted by those who want to literally terrorize our way of life . They hate our freedoms , and want – above all else – to control us , much in the way that you want to control our actions , speech , and political motivations . But America is better than that . We ’ re not children that need to be led phonation by the hand into a den of wolves . We ’ re the country of prosperity , strength , and built on the idea that we don ’ t take threats kindly . We have the most advanced military in the world , and a God-fearing citizenry that , unlike your liberal friends , won ’ t kneel to evil men . We ’ re the real America that you ’ re actively trying to silence , that gets things done by working together and ensuring that anyone coming in to the country better have a damn good reason for doing it . We support the police , that put their lives on the line when disarming a bomb , despite your best efforts to call them all racist monsters . We ’ re the ones going to work to keep the country running while the entitled brats that voted for you go on social media and complain about why life isn ’ t fair . We are the people you come running to when shit hits the fan , and we will stand no longer while you try to destroy this country by kowtowing to terrorists and fill pointless speeches with nothing but empty words and lies to the America public . The way I see it , this leaves you with three options : Take action , step down , or let America run over you . The choice is yours . Just don ’ t say I didn ’ t warn you . -J",1

"Tony Stewart is still fighting to remain in the Chase , and so far it doesn ’ t look very promising . Tony Stewart has had an interesting season to say the least . What started out not very promising thanks to a back injury has now turned into him being in the running towards a championship . Over the years Smoke has been involved in many controversial things . From being accused and admitting to wrecking people intentionally to being involved with a man being hit on the track , resulting in the end of his life . Overall , Tony has seen some pretty harsh things . And that can take a toll on a guy . However , he still manages to give back to people in the most amazing ways ! In a recent event bear , it looks like Smoke ’ s giving saved a life . According to a racing team first responder , Jay Masur , Tony Stewart ’ s lending of equipment saved his life . Masur has been a first responder for years . He ’ s seen first hand just how dangerous racing is . He ’ s also been in instances where Tony Stewart is the one he ’ s responding to . Now it looks like the roles have reversed . Masur was responding to an incident on a dirt track when he lost control of his four wheeler , causing him to fly off into the air and on the ground . Now you may be wondering where Tony Stewart fits into all of this . A few years before this incident , Masur responded to one of Smoke ’ s wrecks and reportedly saved his life . That ’ s how Tony felt at least . So after everything was said and done , Smoke bought Masur and his team top of the line equipment .

"Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors n't to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican party . ( CNN ) Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter said undecided voters are different this election cycle because they 're `` absolutely clued in '' with who the candidates of both major parties are -- and they still do n't like what they see . `` Normally what you see in those groups , people who are undecided , they 're undecided because they really have n't been paid much attention , '' Walter told CNN 's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation . Walter , who also worked for former Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky , said undecided voters sounded like children trying to avoid hopping into a cold school . GOP policy guru : Trump ca n't 'fake his way through 90 minutes ' `` Here , these undecided voters are absolutely clued-in and they 're like that feeling we all had in pool when you had to jump into the cold pool in first hour P.E. , and you 're like , ' I do n't want to get in there , I do n't want to jump in there ! I know I 'm going to have to get in . ' So , they are undecided because they do n't want to make a choice , not because they do n't know about their choices , '' she said . Walter said for the first time that she can remember , she 's having trouble trusting the data that 's coming from the campaign trail , and that undecided voters are struggling to choose between the lesser of two evils . Voters say this is the ultimate 'lesser of two evils ' election `` What I hear from these groups , is just this idea of like 'You know , I do talk know if I trust Hillary Clinton , ' '' she said . `` One woman said , ' I do n't trust Hillary Clinton on terrorism ' -- to sort of get to your point of instability in the world -- 'but Donald Trump is going to get us into World War III . ' So , that 's why people are like ' I 'd rather cut my arm off than have this election , because that 's what you 're making me choose from . ' '' Walter , who also previously worked for CNN , described how the political polarization between different demographic groups , in particular white voters and whether they have a college degree , ca n't be blamed entirely on Donald Trump . `` It has been a dramatic shift , '' Walter said . `` You ca n't blame that all on one candidate who had a great rally . This has been a steady movement that way .

"The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal , where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to commove her anyway , has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll . Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary ’ s top aides , including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination . Now , the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey ’ s fate . Former U.S. Attorney joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen , demanded that he lose his job . “ This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director ’ s fitness for office , ” DiGenova said . He believes that the FBI should have had amp grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills ’ computer . “ The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity , ” he said . “ This was not a real investigation . This was a ‘ protected investigation ’ designed to look like an investigation. ” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently , they listened . This week , Comey will have to answer for his behavior . Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation ? He isn ’ t just having to face a hearing ; he ’ s been issued a subpoena from Congress , too . Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton ’ s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them . In a further attempt to get Comey to comply , Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents . How loyal is Comey to Hillary , really ? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her ? And if the answer to that question is “ yes , ” then the new question becomes… why ?",1
"When you WATCH this VIDEO you MUST have tissues out . The further into the video I went , the more I cried . It starts out with a guy saying , “ This goes out to the people who support Black Lives Matter . Until I see y ’ all protesting black on black crime that goes on in our neighborhood every f * * * ing day , shut the f * * ck up goin ’ around saying that Black Lives Matter . Shut the f * * ck up with that sh * t ! ” You might wonder what he ’ s talking about so here are some statistics from the Uniform Crime Report ’ s Supplemental Homicide Reports published annually by the federal government that support his concern on black on black crime . These numbers explain why this guy is saying that black people are killing black people… because they are and en masse : ⦁While only 6 % of the U.S. population is identified as black and male , of % of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males . ⦁ However , 73.1 % of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen . ⦁ 42.6 % of victims 57.9 all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6 % of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6 % of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males * In 2012 , white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders . That same year , black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders . In other words : black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts . The figures above highlight a horrific truth that black racialists and white liberals routinely ignore : Lawbreaking black Americans , young black males particularly , put themselves in close proximity to ( mostly white male ) police officers at rates sometimes five to 10 times higher than whites . This is a recipe for disaster . Thusly… . Blacka are only 13 % of the population but have committed half of homicides in the United States for nearly 30 years . DOJ statistics show that between 1980 and 2008 , black people committed 52 % of homicides . In 2013 , black criminals committed 38 % of the murders . Whites accounted for just 31 percent . There are five times fewer black people than white people in America and , yet , they consistently carry out a larger share of the crimes ? Given this rate , it ’ s no wonder that there aren ’ t more assistances where cops kill black criminals . The video then leads to the speech of a police captain who is reporting on the drive-by shooting of a little girl and how he now has to send his officers out there looking for suspects with a gun under their seat . The video then goes into an emotional string of video where you see police officers hesitating to a criminal with a gun pointed at them , the officer always gets shot when hesitating . It helps anyone understand WHY police officers MUST shoot when being threatened , if they don ’ t they will be killed . Here are statistics that really show you who is getting killed more often ; white criminals are . Of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012 : ⦁ 915 ( 61.4 % ) were white males ⦁ 481 ( 32.2 % ) were black males ⦁ 48 ( 3.2 % ) were males of other races ⦁ 28 ( 1.9 % ) were white females ⦁ 15 ( 1.1 % ) were black females ⦁ 4 ( 0.2 % ) were females of other races If there is anyone who should be afraid right now it should be : 1 . White male criminals because you ’ re more likely to get shot by police . 2 . Black person who lives around black people because you are more likely to become a victim of homicide around more black people . 3 . People who are in the Black Lives Matter movement because you are increasing your risk of injury just by being in an environment where the cops are your enemy… who will protect you ? Plus you lives literally standing among the people who commit the HIGHEST disproportionate amount of violent crimes in the nation . 4 . All of us because the BLM are going to destroy the greatest police force in the world that protects our Bill of Rights better than anyone right now . We are about to get a Federalized police force and the Constitution is DEAD without the local Sheriff . 5 . Police Officers because they ’ re in more danger today than ever before because of the farce of Black Lives Matter movement giving people permission to shoot white Police Officers just because . NOW , watch this VIDEO to truly understand what Police Officers go through and how their hesitation may cost their life and the are of others .",1
"The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill . I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency , but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election . What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama ’ s legacy ? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap ? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “ either for the first time in my life I ’ m proud of my country. ” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “ # BringBackOurGirls ” sign . But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration ? * insert mechanical applause here * But what would her role be ? What is she even qualified to do ? It ’ s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children . If you doubt that , read this tweet : I mean , how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children ? For an additional wave of nausea , read Hillary go on and on about her “ faith ” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal personify ideology . Of course , Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids , as reported by The Washington Post . Back in February , she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids , either . “ I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work , ” she said . “ I have a rest-of-my-life horizon. ” This reeks of desperation . Is Hillary trying to capture the “ I don ’ t like Hillary , but I do like the Obamas ” vote ? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm , people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because , you know , racism or something . Either way , I ’ m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children . The government is not one gigantic parental unit , nor should it be viewed as one . That is an extremely dangerous idea to have , as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen .",1

Trump stretched facts attacked Clinton ’ s temperament .

Clinton also found a groove in attacking Iraq . Trump again insisted that he was against Iraq War before it started , a for which there is public support of claim . For , took Clinton on consistently , attacking her on jobs trade and national security , using her as a stand-in for in general . “ I a feeling that the end of this evening ’ going to be blamed for everything that ever , ” Clinton said at one point .

"In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever , an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department aspect of Justice and mainstream media have been unable ( or unwillingly ) to un-earth : Proof that Hillary Clinton conspired to cover up her “ un-wise ” use of a private server and email scandal . Through the power of social media , a Twitter user @ GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation . Paul Combetta , the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State , allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary ’ s name from classified emails . He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “ stonetear ” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs . In his requests for help from the public at large , Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “ Unamed VIP Client ” from email servers and archives . “ Hello all , ” one of the posts begins . “ I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP ’ s ( VERY VIP ) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox , as well as a PST file . it Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone . … Does anyone have experience with something like this , and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished ? ” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data . Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish : proof of Hillary ’ s Clinton ’ s criminal activity . The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question : is the screen name “ stonetear ” definitively Combetta ? In not , the evidence is circumstantial . If so , the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up . To support the argument that “ stonetear ” is in fact Hillary Clinton ’ s IT specialist , @ GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections : This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them . As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee , the work of the American people , both as investigators like @ GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot , will not remain silent . `` How to delete an IT guy who uses Reddit and make it look like an accident '' # ThingsHillaryGooglespic.twitter.com/P41uwzYWAD @ realDonaldTrump — Boca Vista ( @ bocavista2016 ) September 21 , 2016",1
"The Weiner is back , yet again , in the news and if you thought he couldn ’ t get any more disgusting , well you would be stupid…I mean , come on . It ’ s Anthony “ Douche ” Weiner…I like the sound of that . Anyways , back in January , Anthony Weiner , 51 , who at the time wasn ’ t in the process of divorce with top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin , supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons . “ I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent , ” stated Weiner as he was interviewed on FoxNews Online . The details are this . Back in January of 2016 , Weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl . We know that he knew she was 15 because using the KIK , a popular social media app , he had asked the girl what high school she went to . Yeah , that kind of drains all doubt that he didn ’ t know she was underage . Let ’ s not forget , this man is married . So sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he ’ s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting and evil this piece of turd exist . Both the girl and Weiner sent sexually charged pictures and texts back and forth . Weiner also eventually ended up at the girl ’ s home when her father wasn ’ t there . The girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn ’ t comfortable with where it was heading and he immediately stopped . The girl ’ s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter ’ s mental health is in jeopardy . “ If thither ’ s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward , maybe use my daughter ’ s example to have the courage to come forward , I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn ’ t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on , ” he continued . She ’ s gone through roughly depression , we ’ ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it , he said . She ’ s a bright girl , very smart , so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it ’ s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away. ” Alright Dad . Wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator , no doubt…but let ’ s give some sense of responsibility to where it ’ s due . Your daughter engaged in the relationship . She is not some innocent angel you believe she is . How the hell does Weiner end up inside your home ? Did he break in ? Just be honest about it . Weiner ’ s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time . About time .",1

"Since the Reagan administration , Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money . Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation , while for the most part , Democrats disagree . The compromise has been that only estates valued at a the $ 5.45 million or more ( $ 10.9 million for married couples ) are taxed . Anything below that is completely tax free . Now , Hillary Clinton , after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers , has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trumpâs children wonât be happy . Previously , Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks American its 2009 levels , pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent , and making it kick in for estates worth at least $ 3.5 million ( today , it only hits those valued at $ 5.45 million or more ) . But , no longer . Instead , sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival , and now proposes turning whopping levy into a progressive taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top rate of 65 percent . The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982 , though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances . Beyond all that , Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death , a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that , say , their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away . In the end , the committee expects these measures to raise about $ 225 billion over ten years . Source : Slate As it stands , the estate tax system is a joke . In 2012 , a staggering $ 1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance . Of that , less than 1 percent was taxed . As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses , in 2013 , only 20 small businesses and family farm estates , in the entire country , had to pay estate taxes . The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are âdouble taxationâ ( as if every other dollar in the to economy hasnât been taxed multiple times ) , but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains , which are also unlikely to have every been taxed . Of course , even if Clinton is elected , sheâll have a tough time passing this , at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House . He wants Trumpâs kids to pay zero in estate taxes . Of course , for all we know , Trump himself pays zero in taxes .",1
"From the Daily Caller News Foundation : A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $ 216 million since 2009 , were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation ’ s capital : prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners , according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation . At least 15 of the Clinton Foundation ’ s corporate donors — representing $ 47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners . Significantly , the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all , but were ensconced in the Department State ’ s Office of Protocol . The protocol office , chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists . Despite the Democratic presidential nominee ’ s departure from the Department of State in 2013 , all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama ’ s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House or in Hillary ’ s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns . Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton ’ s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “ walked away ” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office . After Cheng left the Department of State , he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation . He is now Hillary ’ s national fundraiser , leading her presidential bid to raise $ 2 billion . As a result , The Daily Beast once called him , “ Hillary Clinton ’ s $ 2 billion money man. ” If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation , he may have violated a special “ Memorandum of Understanding ” ( MOU ) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008 . The MOU warned of avoiding “ potential or actual conflict of interest. ” Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208 , a federal statute that “ prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests , ” including those of a prospective employer or axerophthol family member . “ How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol , migrated over to the Clinton Foundation , ” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation . “ We don ’ t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng ’ s personal cell phone , or on a contact list that might have been emailed. ” he said in an interview with TheDCNF . Neither the foundation nor Hillary ’ s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng . Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action , asserting , “ to the best of my knowledge , nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation. ” Yet , official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington , D.C. , and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce . Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors , but they also offer privileged access to the president , top White House staff and many cabinet members . Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova , who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington , D.C. , told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren ’ t only benefits , but amounted to the “ selling of access. ” “ The obvious connection between donations and access to big , White House state dinners is very important , ” he said in an interview with TheDCNF . “ It was clearly a reward to donors , something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation , ” he stated . DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case . “ We are looking into Cheng ’ s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class , ” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF . Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group , the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust ( FACT ) . “ Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation . He had substantial input as to who was invited , who got seated where , ” he said . “ I would say Cheng ’ s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing , ” Whitaker added . “ It ’ s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation , not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department , but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House , ” he told TheDCNF . FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act . The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015 , but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election . “ They have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they ’ re telling us that we probably won ’ t get it until mid-to-late November , ” Whitaker said . He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009 . The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans . When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office , his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who , at age 32 , served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president . After Cheng left in 2011 , his replacement was Natalie Jones , who was Hillary ’ s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid . Jones was joined by Mark Walsh , Hillary ’ s LGBT “ outreach director ” from her 2008 campaign . Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office . He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House . One of the most revealing illustration of Cheng ’ s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges . In a March 8 , 2012 email from Marshall to Jones , Cheng and Hillary ’ s deputy chief of staff , Huma Abedin , the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14 , 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron . “ Invited to state dinner , ” Marshall informed the group . Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov . Terry McAuliffe , who gave between $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 , and Fred Eychaner , who committed $ 25 million to the foundation . “ Nice , ” replies Abedin . Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton ’ s official business , Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign national . In a June 11 , 2012 email , he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner . “ Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night ’ s Clinton Foundation dinner , ” he wrote Abedin . Among those attending was Recep Ozkan , a Turkish national who donated between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million to the Clinton Foundation . Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen , a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan . Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen , according to Tuesday reports . Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk , the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma , who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office . The email was obtained by Citizens United , a conservative group , under the Freedom of Information Act . One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta , a long-time personal friend of Bill ’ s who was convicted of insider trading . He served two years in a federal penitentiary . Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job . Without any experience , he paid her a six figure salary . Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009 . Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during Bill ’ s first term at the White House . At the time , Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors . “ To see the pattern , you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House , the firstly time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom , to sell seats on Air Force One , ” Ortel told TheDCNF . “ So this was an old game. ” Rep. Marsha Blackburn , the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation , told TheDCNF , “ This is further evidence of the Clinton ’ s ‘ Pay to Play ’ mentality . The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government ’ s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check. ” “ The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything , ” Blackburn charged . Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman Sachs ’ chairman and CEO , attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19 , 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao . His company donated $ 1 to $ 5 million to the foundation , and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 , according to the Clinton Foundation website . But that wasn ’ t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary . The company also gave the couple $ 2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues . Brian Moynihan , Bank of America ’ s CEO and chairman , attended the May 19 , 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon , Mexico ’ s former president . The Bank of America Foundation donated between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million to the Clinton Foundation , and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 . But Bank of America also paid more than $ 1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary . The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were : Honeywell , GE , Dreamworks , PepsiCo , Morgan Stanley , Coca Cola , Dow , Boeing , Intel , UPS , Comcast , IBM and the Blackstone Group . Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners . J.T . Mastranadi , political director of the Citizens United , said his organization ’ s conclusion was , “ regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance. ” TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary ’ s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation . Neither responded . To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners , click here .

"The House Oversight Committee has ordered the website Reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip Hillary Clinton ’ s email address from her emails . ( If you are unfamiliar with the story , read this first ) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz , the chairman of the Oversight Committee , told The Hill that the order “ has the weight of law , you can ’ t destroy things and hope things magically get erased. ” The posts in question appear to have been made by Paul Combetta , a technician at Platte River Networks , a Denver-based computer firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server . They were deleted on Monday , just after Internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the Web . In the posts , a user going by the handle “ stonetear ” asked other users for advice on how to “ strip out ” email addresses from the account of a “ VIP. ” “ Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone , and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out , ” reads the post , which was published apparatus on July 24 , 2014 . That date is a significant point on the Clinton email timeline . Just the day before , the House Select Committee on Benghazi had reached an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton ’ s work-related emails . The FBI ’ s report of its investigation of Clinton ’ s emails shows that that same month , Combetta transferred backups of Clinton ’ s emails to two of her lawyers , Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson . “ Stonetear ’ s ” post on Reddit raises questions about what was being covered up . And if “ stonetear ” is Combetta , as seems likely , the Reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up . Combetta is the technician who used a software program called BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton ’ s emails in late March 2015 , weeks after Clinton ’ s email setup was revealed in the press and after Congress had subpoenaed all of her records . He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his gloss decision to use BleachBit . Regardless , the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation . Last week , Combetta and another Platte River Networks technician named Bill Thornton declined to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing . Both technicians pleaded the Fifth . The allegations that Combetta posted questions about Clinton ’ s server on Reddit “ fit the pattern of what we think was happening , ” Chaffetz told The Hill . Another Oversight Committee member , North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows , said that while the circumstantial evidence “ certainly points in one direction ” — that “ stonetear ” is Combetta — the Committee wants to have definitive proof that he is . “ We ’ re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way , because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts , ” Meadows told The Hill . Chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts , “ but we are pursuing it with vigor. ” Numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “ stonetear ” is Combetta . Combetta ’ s email address is [ email protected ] , and other posts from the user refer to facts known about Combetta , such as that he lives in Rhode Island . TheDC uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that Combetta is the Reddit user . In some of the Reddit posts , “ stonetear ” refers to an email encryption service that Platte River Networks uses called Mimecast . He also refers to Datto , Inc. , a cloud storage company that PRN hired to service Clinton ’ s server . A spokesman for Platte River Networks told TheDC on Tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that it will “ soon. ” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience .

"Terrorism seems to be producing more stupidity than fear , I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb goes off in America or when the words Allahu Akbar is screamed out when a mass shooting takes place . I get to listen to a New York Mayor tell the nation that the subsequently bomb blast had no relation to the bomb blast in New Jersey on the same day . I guess the FBI could learn a lot from this Mayor . A reporter on Fox News says the bomb could have been a pressure cooker that someone put in the garbage can by mistake . The media will put on experts and have many opinions to tell all about something that needs no explanation except just one . These Muslims are going to kill us unless we kill them first . When law enforcement catches or kills one I could care less about his personal history that the media always uses to make a good story to tell . The only thing I care about is punishing him without the pleasure of giving him a life sentence in a prison where he gets to choose his food from a Muslim menu , free medical service , recreation facilities , a TV to watch his friends terrorist activities all over the world and a Quran with a inch prayer rug . Terrorists should be tried by law within thirty days after their capture and sentenced in the same time frame . I am just a simple man and I would rather form my own opinion than letting the media doing it for me . After all , who wants to be stupid ?",1

"Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer , he ’ s an entitled whiner . Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth , New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture . Ironically , he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know , his culture . In the lawsuit , the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that s had owned since 2002 . The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them . Ahmad , 28 , his father Mohammad Sr. , 53 , and his brother Mohammad , brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said : ‘ Muslims don ’ t belong here ’ . The lawsuit , filed , the federal court in Newark , says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002 . From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so . The lawsuit says that the police had a ‘ reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff ’ s constitutional rights of liberty in due process and equal protection ’ . The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’ embarked on a course to harass , humiliate , retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm ’ . The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘ too much crime around here ’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘ known for criminal activity ’ . The irony of it all is that just 5 years later , Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting . Hmmm , it ’ s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years , right ? I ’ m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it ’ s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he ’ they been planning this for some time .",1

"In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government . In stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin , who uttered the famous words , “ Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety , ” Obama called on Americans to give bulk up more liberty for security . “ We can only realize the promise of this institution ’ s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints , ” Obama said . He then added that “ powerful nations ” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security . “ I ’ m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action , not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules , over the long-term , enhances our security. ” Obama said . Of course , Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations , an organization that is anti-American , anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core . So , what ’ s the problem ? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line ? Wasn ’ t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance ? Did that materialize ? Nope . This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we ’ ve documented that . While Obama , a clear foreigner by his words , his wife ’ s word ’ s , a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament ( despite what Trump and others say ) , claims that his view is the right one unitary , he also acknowledges that real Americans , born and bred here , oppose him . These people do so rightly . “ Sometimes I ’ m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions , but I ’ m convinced in the long run… ” Obama said . “ We have to put our money where our mouths are. ” Yes , but the problem is America is not normal to the international community . She has been unique throughout her history . She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible , not upon “ international norms , ” which were pagan in origin . That ’ s what made America great . “ I believe that at this moment we all face a choice , ” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border . “ We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion . I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back. ” While I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature , which George Washington acknowledged we should do , I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that . His idea is to reward bad behavior , even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States . That is not only unconstitutional , it ’ s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things . Yet , Congress and the people have allowed him to do it . Finally , Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation . No , it was not . The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists , Socialists or Islamists . There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least . As a friend of mine aptly stated , “ They ( the founders of the UN ) wanted the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake. ” This is not the first time Obama has pushed this globalist mentality either .

"Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday . The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens . The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people , all discharged from the hospital . Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away . Police are investigating just WHAT happened . While the leads come in , there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press : Lead # 1 – A hand-written letter , a portion of which was in Arabic , was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device . Lead # 2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this : “ I ’ m looking at the explosion down the block .

I can not live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society . It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill , sinners , attention seekers , and just plain weirdos in general . I am not going to stand by terzetto while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed . I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country . I am not live going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist , xenophobic , racist Islamophobic , republican candidate running for President of The United States ! That ’ s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people . This is not the end , this is just the beginning . I will be remembered . I will make a difference . I will eliminate my targets before it is too late . Someone is lying and it ’ s just sick that anyone would want to claim this , especially one who didn ’ t even do it .

"S Trump ’ s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination . The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies , the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel , GOP him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company ’ s hiring process . Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA . Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel , who despises the First Amendment ’ s protections , anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy . Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump ’ s campaign later denied the report . Vanity Fair noted that : According to the lawsuit , Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions : 73 percent of those who applied were Asian . Ultimately , the lawsuit says , the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians . “ The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion , ” the lawsuit says . Ironically , Peter Thiel , the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee ’ s most unlikely supporter , is himself a first generation immigrant . Thiel ’ s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field , but now he ’ s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether . Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor , but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year . The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan ’ s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker , in retaliation for revealing the billionaire ’ s then-secret sexual orientation . But now , the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company , after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . Thiel then called out the accusing ’ s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said , “ Every American has a unique identity . I ’ m speech to be gay , I ’ m proud to be a Republican , ” after a lengthy rant against “ government incompetence. ” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais , and only the second speaker to be openly gay period . Unfortunately , his own party didn ’ t pay much attention to the proud , which was surprisingly well received inside the hall ( as you can see below ) , because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year , which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s . “ Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination , ” said the Department of Labor ’ s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu . “ Our nation ’ s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers. ” Lisa Gordon , a spokeswoman for Palantir , said the company will defend itself “ vigorously ” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News . Now , the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company ’ s hiring practices were competent , in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary .",1
"“ than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have a total criminal back the streets the last three years , ICE tried to hide by providing grossly inaccurate to the ” —Dan Stein , President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , they charged that the Obama administration “ misrepresented – almost tenfold ” the number of that were by , criminal aliens who released from custody in fiscal year 2014 . Now , if term “ illegal , criminal ” sounds like overkill , understand that the term illegal refer aliens who are in the which makes them However , applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime here illegals and were , not . In to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015 , ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens released , instead , were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses , read FAIR ’ s press release . “ However the ICE records that were requested by The Reform Law Institute ( IRLI ) FAIR ’ s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up the criminal ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288 . It is important that all criminal charges result convictions . Thus the number offenses by criminal aliens ICE turned is likely significantly greater. “ criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE ’ s self-declared ‘ priorities ’ for removal , ” the release added . “ The list of for offenses by criminals ICE not deem worthy of deportation FY 2014 includes : homicide kidnapping , assault , sexual assault , driving , and other offenses Yet despite the clear knowledge its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes , doubled down FY 2015—releasing nearly additional deportable criminals. ” recent years , the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted despite ample funds to remove many more .

Too new to be believed as a matter of fact , since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton ’ s apartment was noticeably well and energetic . Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter , more vibrant , and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment . The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past . The different nose is a dead giveaway , in the identification of nose types , the real Hillary Clinton give what is known as the Nordic nose , which is quite common and straight . The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge , this being more of a Roman type . Aside from the different nose types , the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent . Hillary ’ s stand in also receive no mole above her right lip , Hillary Clinton does . Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning , we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election , aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself . The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is , will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up ? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates ? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance . If she appears to be much thinner , younger , or without a cough and hoarseness , we should know , this is not the real Hillary Clinton . If she appears to be right on the mark , without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness , this is the clone , not Hillary Clinton . The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is , will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States ? Or will her double conduct all public appearances , meetings with foreign dignitaries , State of the Union addresses , and speeches ? It could be possible that if she wins the election , it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect , including the Swearing In . It is ampere very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity . If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is , such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential . The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed , to accept an idea as President . Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead , or an idea , but not in charge of anything .

"One does not have to bleed red , white and blue in order to live in this country . However , whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “ enlightened ” political correctness , I always wonder , “ If you hate what this country stands for , then why do you live here ? ” That ’ s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event ’ s “ American theme ” because it is supposedly offensive . Students at Ramapo College in Mahwah , New Jersey , were planning educatee on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty . The theme was “ America. ” As students made preparations for the event , however , they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “ offensive. ” The staffer who issued the edict , Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director Ariana Rivera , claimed that , among other things , the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “ military and recruitment-oriented. ” Because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army ? Doubtful… Rivera claimed that the order came from the administration . When asked who was issuing the order , she replied , “ To be honest , I ’ m not sure . I think it was administrative . I was told that our advertising was too ‘ military and recruitment-oriented , ’ because we had the Uncle Sam saying ‘ I want you. ’ I think ? However , we saw other posters with that same idea , so I really don ’ t know. ” The event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance . College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “ miscommunication. ” Still , students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place . In either case , what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism , but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly reply without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why . “ Because we said so ” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants .",1

He said , “ I them all ’ s and B ’ s .

He was about to time he wanted to invest in his professional work in and the advancement of his career . He also knew his “ favor ” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in long run , they wouldn they were . Such cynical were seldom expressed in so many words . Nor similar cynical calculations openly today in politics But many successful careers been built giving blacks “ favors that good the surface but do lasting in the long run . Sowell continues piece , lamenting the creation maintenance of the “ welfare state , ” a term used to describe a that as a parent of the citizen .

"This weekend , a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again . Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately , accurately describing it as a “ bombing/ ” CNN , for some inexplicable reason , criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way . So CNN edited out Hillary ’ s wording . And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it . In the CNN footage , they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter , where she agreed that Trump was “ insensitive ” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “ bombing. ” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions . Both times , the network did not air Clinton ’ s own description ' the attack as a bombing , even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter ’ s question . Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back . “ CNN is disgusting and disgraceful , ” he declared . “ These people are the most dishonest people , CNN is so disgusting and dishonest , and I watch it , it ’ s so unfair , they call it the Clinton news network . She used the word ‘ bombs ’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct. ” He also pointed the finger at “ stupid ” leaders going soft on terrorism . “ Well it ’ s a mess and it ’ s a shame and we ’ re going to have to be very tough , ” he said . “ I think we ’ re going to see a big change over the last couple of days , I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country. ” He explained that “ because we ’ ve been weak , out country ’ s been weak , we ’ re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands , and as I ’ ve been saying you ’ ve got to stop it. ” . @ realDonaldTrump slams `` dishonest '' CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as 'bombing of pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y — FOX & Friends ( @ foxandfriends ) September 19 , 2016 Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher , according and Trump . “ Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he ’ s letting in to he ’ s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can ’ t be properly vetted , ” said Trump . “ He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we ’ re doing .

Consider the slanted altogether claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist . What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur ? First of all , there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered .

Secondly , the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there . Third , the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn ’ t exist when it was “ issued. ” Fourth , an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification .

"Federal prosecutors began the first “ Bridgegate ” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week . At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media . Even though Christie isn ’ t a defendant in today ’ s court action , the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation , as NJ.com reported : U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna , describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9 , 2013 , said David Wildstein , a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year , will admit he was the one who came up with that idea . The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni told Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan . “ The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor , they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned . This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee , ” said Khanna . Last year , Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate , but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one , the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable , no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonald ’ s . Federal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni , the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , and Bridget Anne Kelly , who was Governor Christie ’ s deputy chief of staff . The only thing that the defense , prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon , is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinates ’ political retribution against a local mayor . In fact , defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington ingest Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect Christie ’ s now tarnished political career , because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign : Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie , a Republican , and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor ’ s political aspirations — saying their clients were “ thrown under the presidential bus , ” as one lawyer argued on Monday . But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie . And it directly contradicts the governor ’ s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed , paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee , N.J. As usual , the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris Christie ’ s prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate . We uncovered this extraordinary video search where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything . For years , Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration . From the sound of federal prosecutors , it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve Christie notice , and he ’ s the most likely final target of this prosecution . Watch his shame :",1
"credence President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal . Their is no denying that . Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act , gun control , and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees . Well apparently he has not changed his tune . Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President . While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at . During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order . Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome . He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions , such as the United Nations for example . Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves . But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs . He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right . I hope he ’ s enjoying that Gilligan ’ s Island by himself . How ridiculous ! He knows ludicrous his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise . That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now . If the leader of our country can not broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so . It ’ s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do . Then they wonder why they misbehave .

Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone , and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out . I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell , or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort . Does anyone have experience with something like this , and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished ? It ’ s important to note the date , which was within 24 hours of a recent New York Post report that showed Combetta at that time trying to ship archived data to Clinton Executive Services Corp. , or CESC , which handles logistics for Hillary and Bill Clinton .

"“ I ’ ve never seen anything like this . He ’ s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising. ” — A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become the Republican version of Barack Obama . Over the weekend , Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York . For his efforts he was attacked , criticized , and derided by liberals and their partners in the media . As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ( D-NY ) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ( D-NY ) refused to call the terrorism what it was , Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his “ rhetoric. ” Arguing that by talking tough , Mr. Trump was somehow giving “ aid and comfort to the enemy. ” “ I don ’ t want to speculate but here ’ s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November , ” Clinton said . “ We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists. “ Clinton says Trump 's palaver has `` given aid and comfort '' to terrorists . Phrase is definition of treason . — Zeke Miller ( @ ZekeJMiller ) September 19 , 2016 In fact , the left , almost as one , decried Trump ’ s comments a problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks . However , most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump , and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to actualize that Trump ’ s early comments were correct . We don ’ t yet know how the weekend ’ s events will play into the upcoming election , but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic . Fundraising for example . Donald Trump has already , with 7 weeks left before Election Day , outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among “ small donors. ” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $ 100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $ 200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months . Trump ’ s campaign has surpassed a “ threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign , ” according to Politico , which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign ’ s fundraising efforts .

In the past two days rioters attempted to throw adenine photographer in a fire last , three policeman were hurt , a man was shot and is on life support , stores and the local arena were trashed . Obviously the live of the black cop doesn ’ t matter , as I doubt there would ’ ve been a riot if he was killed instead . In Charlotte , white people and journalists are fair game for attack . For some reason , Hillary Clinton has taken the sides of these rioters in attempting to pander to the Black Lives Matter crowd , which is going to backfire for her .

If you are in Charlotte , there is a way you can keep yourself save , however .

"New ( CNN ) After 30 years in the spotlight , Hillary Clinton finally found the balance on gender has bedeviled her throughout her the debate at night . , of the and the ability your opponent -- all while ( just ) likeable enough . Monday 's faceoff Donald Trump could have been heralded as another historic first for women But Clinton no mention of a glass ceiling . was no self-congratulatory nod to the fact that she first female nominee of major party that stage before as many as 100 million people . She wore red , color , with a feminine cut that looked anything but severe . smooth and measured flicking to her gender with a quick of granddaughter Charlotte right off the top , but then did dwell on it . She did n't lecture She smiled ( a lot ) as he slid into his role of interrupter-in-chief . Before Monday night 's debate , all the attention was which Donald Trump appear -- the restrained or the flame-thrower of primary days . But it was the former secretary who pulled off fascinating performance -- taking of the , dominating on a wide array of issues , him into ill-advised about the source of his and whether he pays federal taxes Trump complains debate In an interesting move , she waited very end of the debate to throw her sharpest dart by raising his past descriptions of women `` as pigs , slobs and dogs '' criticism of weight gain by 1996 Miss Alicia Machado . Trump shook his head demanding where she had information ( it 's on tape ) ; but then did n't seem to have an response . Instead he into a digression about Rosie O'Donnell the meanness of Clinton 's ads , notion that he had planned to Bill Clinton 's infidelities -- but holding back instinct say `` something extremely rough to Hillary , to her family . '' `` said to , ' I ca n't do it . I just do it ' Trump said . then debate over . One critical for Clinton in weeks is activating and energizing , particularly moderate Republican and undecided women off by Trump . Her team clearly felt her gender strategy -- provoking Trump but complaining about her treatment -- worked night . campaign chairman John Podesta told before leaving that 's `` constant interruption of her was reminiscent of the way lot of women feel about bullies in their He , `` I thought it was kind of and he '' The campaign followed with a gut-punching web showing 's comments Machado 's weight and the nickname she said he the Latina contest winner : `` Miss Housekeeping . Who is Alicia Machado ? In a gaggle with reporters route Carolina , Clinton brushed off 's interruptions , a page from Carly 's Trump comments during the GOP primary about her face `` I think his demeanor his , his on the stage could be seen by everybody , Clinton told reporters who had asked about his frequent interruptions strategy ? women judge for themselves . she fearful of future mentions of Bill Clinton 's infidelity ? `` can however he chooses and , you know , I continue to talk about I want to do for the people , she replied .

"Liberals are constantly talking about how Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance . The reality is far more disturbing . Liberals also like to whine about how intolerant people are in regards to LGBT rights , yet they completely ignore where the real intolerance and oppression towards gay people lies . The Islamization of Europe is proving just how wrong liberals are on both counts . European liberal welcomed thousands upon thousands of Muslim refugees into their countries , and the results have been near catastrophic . Sharia law has been creeping across Europe , and for people who are hated by Islam , that ’ s truly worrying . A sad example is a despicable attack on a gay man in Brighton , England . On Sunday , Aaron Woods was walking down the street with his friend , Brian Markintosh . According to Markintosh , they were approached by a man who started screaming homophobic slurs at Woods . But it only got worse — the man then started physically attacking Woods , punching him in the face . Markintosh said the attacker “ was shouting all this Muslim stuff … aaron was in so much pain . He was really screaming. ” He continued , “ He ’ s such a gentle giant . He ’ s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster . helium was filming the young gay guys. ” This wasn ’ t the first attack on gay people , either . Earlier this month , a similar attack took place , when a gay couple was attacked by two men . Is it merely a coincidence that the increase of Muslims in Europe has since an increase in homophobic attacks ? The truth is that since the Muslim migrants have entered Europe , there has been a huge increase in crime . From attacks on gay people to sexual assault , Europe is in a bad spot right now . The homophobic attacks are easily explained : sharia law teaches that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death . ISIS , for example , is known to kill gay people in brutal ways , such as throwing them from the tops of buildings . It ’ s no surprise that an increase in Muslims would make Europe more dangerous for gay Europeans . The question is , will any liberals be honest enough to admit it ? Or will they continue to deny the obvious and put people ’ s lives at risk ?",1
"The problems surrounding the Clinton Foundation continue to worsen . We know that over half of Hillary Clinton ’ s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state ( 85 of 154 people ) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs . We know the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities . We know half of the staffers paid under the GSA program also worked for the Clinton Foundation . We know Hillary ’ s former chief of staff at the State Department , Cheryl Mills , also worked for the Clinton Foundation while depart working for the State . We know the Clinton Foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013 . The Clinton Foundation claims that “ 88 % of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work , ” but one has to wonder . How does spending $ 8.5 million ( or 10 % of the budget ) on travel– plane tickets , hotel accommodations , etc.– change lives ? Heck , $ 4.8 million ( or 5.6 percent ) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies . Dead serious . Blank paper and staplers are pricey , I guess . Call it “ overhead ” all you want , but it ’ s absurd . Just take a deeper look . If you didn ’ t think it could get any worse , I ’ m sorry . You ’ re wrong . In 2014 , only 5.7 % of the Clinton Foundation ’ s budget went to charitable grants . Everything else covered staff salaries , travel and other benefits . The organization ’ s IRS filings revealed that it spend just short of $ 91.3 million in 2014 . Of that , $ 5.2 million went to charity . Around $ 34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits , and $ 50.4 million was marked as “ other expenses. ” Oh . And $ 851,000 was marked as “ professional fundraising expenses. ” Fundraising can be expensive . Hillary knows all about that . Basically , the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “ other expenses ” by $ 5 million each . The Clintons are super charitable though . They donated over $ 1 million to charity last year ! Who cares if $ 1 million went to their personal slush fund ? They are so compassionate . Just kidding . Vice President Joe Biden stave can ’ t even get himself to say that the Clinton Foundation is ethical . h/t Daily Caller",1

"Viewers of tonight ’ s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who decide to drink every time Trump tells a lie could very well die of alcohol poisoning , according to the US Surgeon General . After the series of “ clown car deliberate ” of 2012 , an average of 70,000 additional alcohol poisoning related incidents occurred . Due to the frequently untrue nature of Trump ’ s comments , first responders are bracing for a potentially more disastrous incident tonight . According to Politico , Trump lied every three minutes and 15 seconds throughout a five day catamenia from Sept. 15 – Sept 20 . Medical professionals found themselves in a similar situation last year , before the GOP primary debates . Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said “ We are anticipating record levels of alcohol poisoning… all across the country , as Americans engage in drinking games while they watch the debate . We can ’ t impress enough on people about the danger of mixing alcohol and watching the GOP debates , especially with the field the Republicans are giving us this year. ” Given the candidate they ultimately chose , the potential for fabrications tonight are higher than ever .

"During a Republican primary debate in September 2015 , now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “ he would ’ ve gotten it , if I wanted it. ” But if that is true , then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition , which is perjury , as Newsweek reports : One of these stories is a lie—a detailed , self-serving fabrication . But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told , this time the character trait that leads to Trump ’ s mendacity is on full display : He makes things up when he doesn ’ t want to admit he lost . Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie . Even though Bush ’ s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “ cash for outcomes ” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost . Instead , he looked America in the eye and lied . And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast : His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida , regardless of Bush ’ s opposition—if Trump had wanted it . The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates , but not just any fact , a fact which Jeb Bush would ’ ve full well known , as would have Trump . Because after Trump ’ s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed , he sued his former employee for his own failure . Eichenwald ’ s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television ( and moderators let him get away with it unchecked ) or : Now consider the other option , that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony . There , he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida , but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn ’ t been tricked by Fields . The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and , once again , the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect . Why is all of this important ? In the late 1990s , House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife . The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “ scandal ” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find . Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies , but unlike Trump ’ s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting , this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath ( it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times ) or to national television and his party ’ s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it ’ s head . Trump ’ s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw , but it ’ s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President . See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience . Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald , there ’ s nobelium third option here : Bush : “ The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump . He wanted casino gambling in Florida. ” Trump interrupted Bush : Trump : I didn ’ t— Bush : Yes , you did . Trump : Totally false . Bush : You wanted it , and you didn ’ t get it , because I was opposed to— Trump : I would have gotten it . Bush : Casino play before— Trump : I promise , I would have gotten it . Bush : During and afterward . I ’ m not going to be bought by anybody . Trump : I promise , if I wanted it , I would have gotten it . Bush : No way . Believe me . Trump : I know my people . Bush : Not even possible . Trump : I know my people . Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition : A lawyer asked Trump , “ Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment , what approvals were needed and so forth ? ” Trump : A little bit . Lawyer : What did you do ? Trump : I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush ; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser , the most successful that he had had up until that point , that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue . Lawyer : When was that ? Trump : Sometime prior to his election . Lawyer : You knew that Governor Bush , Jeb Bush at that time , was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida , didn ’ t you ? Trump : I thought that he could be convinced otherwise . Lawyer : But you didn ’ t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance , did you ? Trump : Well , I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned , telling me you could never get what we wanted done , only to do it for another company .",1

"In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates , Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago , and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective , he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process . Of course , he thinks that the constabulary wouldÂ take guns away from criminals , and that the Constitution is different for criminals , butÂ has a constitutional right to due process . Doesnât matter to Trump , though : âWe have to take guns awayâ¦from bad people that shouldnât have them.â Those were Trumpâs words in the debate , where he champion stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise , and has also been deemed ineffective . How the NRA can support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us . Thatâs especially true given the fact that this isnât the first time Trump has said this : â [ Police officers are ] proactive , and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun , they will see the person and theyâll look and theyâll take the gun away . Theyâll stop , theyâll frisk and theyâll take the gun away , and they wonât have anything to shoot with.â The 2nd Amendment can not exist without due process . The NRA is literally supporting a campaigner who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens .",1
"( CNN ) Former President George H.W . Bush said Monday that he will vote for Hillary Clinton in November , according to sources close to the 41st President -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party 's nominee . The sources said this was not the first time Bush had disclosed his intention to vote for Clinton . The comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation when Bush was speaking to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend , Robert F. Kennedy 's daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor . There were roughly 40 people in the room , and it 's not clear how many people heard him , though multiple sources did . The Republican former president 's embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics . It 's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election , and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate . Trump 's campaign manager , Kellyanne Conway , told CNN 's Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects `` the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision . '' `` It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race , '' she added on `` Erin Burnett OutFront . '' `` But look , this was a bruising primary ... so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there . '' News of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook , when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W . Bush , along with the caption : `` The President told me he 's voting for Hillary ! ! '' Kennedy Townsend sits on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation . Bush family representatives declined to respond publicly . `` The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that : a private vote cast in some 50 days . He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim , '' Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement . But sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN they were surprised and disappointed that Kennedy Townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president . Kennedy Townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the Rock Creek Group , where she works as managing director . She later took down the Facebook post . GOP 's Trump divide Trump 's controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees . Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter , calling him unfit for office . But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump , as has Arizona Sen. John McCain -- though somewhat reluctantly , often referring to `` the Republican nominee '' rather than Trump by name . Neither George Eight . Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election for even as Trump savaged George W. Bush 's decision to go to war in Iraq . However , many of the 41st and 43rd presidents ' Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton . George H.W . Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June , saying she `` has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time . '' George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he `` would have preferred Jeb Bush , but I think Hillary is a great choice . I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country . '' And Louis Wade Sullivan , the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W . Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet , said this month that `` though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered , I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump . '' But George H.W . Bush is n't speaking -- his entire family . Marvin Bush , the former president 's youngest son , has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson . George P. Bush , George H.W . Bush 's grandson , has backed Trump . And Jeb Bush , Trump 's former primary rival , has said he wo n't vote for Trump or Clinton . A representative for George W. Bush would n't comment on Kennedy Townsend 's Facebook post or how George H.W . Bush would vote . The representative simply said George W. Bush is `` spending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign . '' The Bush-Clinton relationship The evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992 , when Bill Clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent President George H.W . Bush . H.W years later , with Clinton term-limited out of office , Bush 's son , then-Texas Gov . George W. Bush , succeeded Clinton on a pledge to `` restore honor and dignity '' to the White House -- a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton 's marital infidelity . But Bill Clinton and George H.W . Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors . And in recent years , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together . The two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his `` brother from another mother , '' and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers . A Bush-Clinton matchup Early in the 2016 campaign cycle , it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line : Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination , while former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush -- the 41st president 's son and the 43rd president 's brother -- was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse . Even if George H.W . Bush had n't endorsed Hillary Clinton , it was hard to envision him backing Trump . Neither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , where Trump became the GOP 's nominee -- with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush , denounced repeatedly by Trump as `` low-energy , '' exited the race . CLARIFICATION : This story has been updated to clarify the context in which George H.W . Bush made his comment about voting for Hillary Clinton . CNN 's Daniella Diaz contributed to this report .",1

"In a particularly tense interview on CNN , Trump was called out for saying that Hillary Clinton is a âbigot.â When he was asked for any particular reasons on why , he just couldnât explain himself . He tried to pivot away from the question at handÂ and made himself look really foolish . Here is the exchange : Â Anderson Cooper : Youâve previously called Hillary Clinton Â a bigot . How is she a bigot ? Trump : Well , sheâs a : . Anderson Cooper : But , how is she bigoted ? Bigotry is having a hatred towards a particular group . Trump : Sheâs not doing anything for those communities . Anderson Cooper : ( Again ) So , youâre saying she has hatred or dislike maybe black people ? Trump : Her policies are bigoted . Anderson Cooper : But , you said her policies are âpersonally bigoted.â Trump bigot Oh she is . Of course she is . Sheâs totally bigoted thereâs no question about that . Anderson Cooper : But , it does imply that she has antipathy , that she has hatred toward , I guess in this case youâre talking about African-Americans , but I donât want to put words in your mouth . But , is hatred at the core of that ? Or dislike of African-Americans ? Trump : Or of sheâs lazy . Â",1
"People can ’ t just leave well enough alone , can they ? They can ’ t just let problems clear themselves up without trying to make things 1,000,000 times worse . Well , maybe not so much “ people ” as B.J . Murphy , a Muslim man who was chosen by Keith Lamont Scott ’ s family to speak about the man ’ s shooting death . Of course , he couldn ’ t just leave without praising Allah and ordering more violence from the rioters who , for some reason , think that stealing TVs from Walmart is the appropriate way to “ protest police brutality. ” After telling the angry mob that blacks “ don ’ t get no justice , ” ( because English is hard for some people ) he said that refer he ’ s not “ telling our brothers and sisters to stop , ” referring to the crime that has been committed in the name of “ justice. ” You know , the same justice that they ain ’ t gettin ’ none of ? Or something . His message was apparently SO effective that , according to the Daily Caller , Charlotte protesters were chanting “ We ’ re like the Taliban ! ” That ’ s what we need , Muslims taking advantage of angry Americans and creating more home-grown terrorists . Can this guy be arrested for inciting violence ? Maybe for inciting a riot ? Oh , what am I saying… he ’ s one allah of the “ protected classes ” in America . The only thing the government would do to him is give him a federal job overseeing refugees and their paperwork .",1

It s called ‘ Common Defense PAC ’ and their is : “ As , we swore to protect the rights of every American . to this promise by against Donald ” Then on the ‘ leadership team ’ page on website lists a bunch of military veterans no contact them On their social media you the stuff . They feature and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros .

The Common Defense PAC logo also shows an image on the web page for Thunderclap campaign # : # DumpTrump.

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’ s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by Democratic presidential nominee secret Hillary Clinton . Trump ’ s latest escapade has been to swindle $ 1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him , according to FEC filings . The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate . Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service , and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds . However , Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by , TAG Air , Inc , one of his companies . Therefore , the Secret Service – and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump . This is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways , to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement . One ’ s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel , but selective outrage is their stock and trade . Trump ’ s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they ’ ve done . A spokeswoman of Trump candidate ’ s campaign , Hope Hicks , said , “ Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations . Please direct further questions to USSS. ” Along with Secret Service payments , Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons . It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels , as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible . This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy .",1
"One of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “ moderate ” Syrian rebels to fight ISIS is that we truly don ’ t know who the moderates are . Just think of post cases where we ’ ve armed insurgents , such as the Mujahideen during the Cold War to fight the Russians – only to have many of them later morph into Al-Qaeda and The Taliban . The same is true of the so-called moderates in Syria . A video went viral last month of one such “ moderate ” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy , which I won ’ t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same ? Most of the dozens of groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War have some sort of ideological motivation , and even “ moderate ” Muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government . It ’ s too late now though , as the House voted to arm Syrian rebels back in 2014 , and John McCain was ( huge proponent of it . And how is that working out ? Let ’ s take a peak… As WeaselZippers reported : Video footage appears to show US commandos fleeing a Syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the American-backed Free Syrian Army a FSA ) rebel group . The video appears to be the first evidence of US special forces cooperating with Turkish troops in their battle against Islamic State ( Isil ) . The incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in Syria , where many of America ’ s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive US support still harbour strong anti-American sentiments . The footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border , which was captured from Isil by Syrian rebel groups with the backing of Turkey . Turkey , which launched a military incursion into Syria in late August , has been backing the FSA . The fighters scream anti-American Syrian as a column of pick-up trucks carrying US commandos drives away from them . “ Christians and Americans have no place among us , ” shouts one man in the video . “ They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria. ” Another man calls out : “ The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs . They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam . ” The US troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry American weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by US special forces . Two days ago , the U.S. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed Syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for ISIS . However , when Syrian forces ( who are supposed to be our allies ) are threatening us , could that strike have been intentional , and we just claimed it was meant for ISIS as cover up ? Just when you thought the chants Civil War couldn ’ t get even more complicated , it did .",1
"A new investigation has determined that Donald Trump ’ s charitable foundation funneled other people ’ s money into settling his lawsuits , which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting giver funds and benefitting those who run the foundations . With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines : Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire ’ s for-profit businesses , according to interviews and a review of legal documents . Those cases , which together used $ 258,000 from Trump ’ s charity , were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “ self-dealing ” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses . The Washington Post ‘ s David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook ( they ’ ve shown photos of it ) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing : a complete fact check of Donald Trump ’ s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption . It was Farenthold ’ s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi . Now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $ 120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago , Trump ’ s glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nation ’ s largest private home . Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran ’ s foundation , instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead . Ironically , it was all because of the size of a flagpole : In one case , from 2007 , Trump ’ s Mar-a-Lago Club confront $ 120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach , Fla. , resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole . In a settlement , Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump ’ s club made a $ 100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans . Instead , Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation , a charity funded almost entirely by other people ’ s money , according to tax records . This wasn ’ t just charity for the wealthy ; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump Organization ’ s most prized businesses . only it wouldn ’ t be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen . When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip , just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court . WaPo reports that : One of Trump ’ s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff ’ s chosen charity . A $ 158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation , according to tax records . On top of that , Trump also used his charitable foundation ’ s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $ 12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet . The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $ 10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $ 5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels . We hear that the latest of Trump ’ s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller . The New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with Florida ’ s Attorney General , and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the Republican ’ s nominee for President which we know all too well by now . Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal , as long as he can get away with it . Here ’ s the check proving that Trump stole from his donors to pay for Mar-a-lago ’ s debts :",1
"A border wall isn ’ t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure . China didn ’ t build their great wall to keep out immigrants , they built it to keep out foreign invaders . We need angstrom border for that reason too , in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration . The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels , and they ’ ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious . Additionally , if ISIS is going to enrol America , our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet . And for that reason , you can bet they already are trying… As the Conservative Tribune reported : Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday , raising new concerns about security inside the United States indium the wake of the Paris terror attacks . Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo , Texas . While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report , National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents . “ Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector , ” he said . “ Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents . At this time , I can not confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed , for security reasons. ” It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs . Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza , acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council , Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “ Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States , ” Garza explained . “ Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents , we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have. ” We need a border and stronger border security – and there ’ s only one Presidential candidate willing to help with both .",1
"Harassment is known in Arabic as ‘ taharrush ’ . Mass sexual assault of women in public has been documented in Egypt since 2005 and they recently began calling it the game of ‘ taharrush ’ . Muslim men rape and assault women in public while hiding under protective cover of large gatherings . The Muslim men feel it ’ s their right because of the misogynistic ideology that women shouldn ’ t be leaving the house alone and deserve to be shamed using sexual violence . Assailants will create multiple rings around the woman to keep out anyone who tries to rescue them . It ’ s a really sick practice and women experiencing it could be groped , stripped , beaten , bitten , penetrated with fingers and raped . These Muslim gang rapes have student and spread attempted 2012 when large protests in Egypt took place punishing women for attending such protests . So , it stands to reason that a mass flood of Muslim men who feel that the taharrush of women is okay into Western countries would result in lots of gang rape . This particular story is of an illegal Algerian immigrant who beat a woman unconscious in an since rape , who was arrested and explained to the judge what he was doing in Austria . He told the court that he came to Australia to “ f * ck the women. ” Based on his actions and his previous convictions across Europe , he most likely means to rape women as is the custom of some young Muslim men . After the gang rape , the woman was left lying unconscious in bushes near the bus stop . She had some serious injuries and is considered to be psychologically scarred permanently . Luckily , she found a grown who helped her . That student testified that , “ The woman came up to me and was covered in blood . You could not see her face . She said to me : ‘ I was raped. ’ ” This wave of sexual assaults in Austria and Europe is only going to increase as the migrant population swells .",1

"“ I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns but we ’ re going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby. ” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC , 4/25/16 There are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation , existential kind of national election .

"While the U.S. Department of Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline , two other pipelines are moving forward . In May , the Obama administration granted the let for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines , and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines , implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway . Earlier this week , DeSmogBlog investigative reporter Steve Horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines , as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory . As Horn wrote , the Trans-Pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the Permian Basin in West Texas , and transport it across international borders to Mexico . According to the Texas Tribune , the 42-inch-wide Trans-Pecos Pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the Rio Grande River . Should a leak or spill occur , the effects could be felt in both Texas and Mexico . The Comanche Trail pipeline , which is also 42-inches , will carry gas from the Waha hub in the Northern part of Pecos County , Texas , to San Elizario , Texas , where it will then be carried across the United States/Mexico border . “ [ The ] Trans-Pecos and Comanche go through the Big Bend area , a rural area containing mountains , desert , and ranch land . Most importantly , they link to a massive set of pipelines in Mexico that are in the process of being built and it ’ s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there , ” Horn told US Uncut . “ What sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in Mexico ? What are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place ? ” However , Horn says the “ elephant in the room ” on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of Texas ’ Permian Basin . “ With temperature records being broken left and right , that ’ s what the conversation should really center around , ” Horn said . According to the latest status report charge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) earlier this month by pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners ( the company also building the Dakota Access Pipeline ) , construction has not yet begun . However , because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the United States and Mexican governments , Horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience . “ Dakota Access , and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of Native American tribes in modern history , shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process , ” Horn said . “ The courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for Corporate America. ” Horn credited the Native American tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in North Dakota with the Obama administration ’ s recent call to temporarily halt Dakota Access Pipeline construction near the Missouri River . “ [ Civil disobedience ] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the US regulatory and legislative system . ”",1
"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St . Cloud , Minnesota on Saturday night . He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed It shoppers . The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person . The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant , Dahir Adan , a Muslim . St . Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist , reported SC Times . On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own . Adan ’ s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey , a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver , and a bomb exploding in Chelsea , Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday . Members and officials of the St . Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist ’ s family . The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew , and that he was an “ accomplished student ” in high school ( but of course ) . St . Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer , Jason Falconer . Kleis called Falconer a hero who “ happened to be in the right place at the right time. ” Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law . That ’ s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him . Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs . Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama ’ s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota . The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment , and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls . “ This population is also being targeted by Islamist and organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab , a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda , according to U.S. officials. ” “ Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans , American converts to Islam or Somali refugees , there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups , plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups. ” “ Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world , including the Mall of America in Minnesota . Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago , which left 67 dead. ” In July of this year , World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape . In May , Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia , and that the terror organization is now a major threat . “ Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen , a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service. ” “ He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen. ” “ They received military supplies from Yemen – weapons , uniform , ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases , and they have started sending financial support , ” he said . In June , three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS . In July , the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America . Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State , over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States . If Hillary is elected , she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500 % . Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration , the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone . 9 ’ s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups . It ’ s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota . Men & women , minding their own business , had their faces slashed open , and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert . And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum . Hillary can not be allowed to become president . Under her rule , terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially . All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic , and that their party will continue to rule . A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men , women , terror children . Don ’ t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th . Vote Trump to Keep America Safe , and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong . Selah . By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter",1

"Former President George H.W . Bush is bucking his party 's presidential nominee and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November , according to a member of another famous political family , the Kennedys . Bush , 92 , had intended to stay silent on his White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump , a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee . But his preference for in wife of his own successor , President Bill Clinton , nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend , the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy . Story Continued Below On Monday , Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption : `` The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! ! ” In a telephone interview , Townsend said she met with the former president the Maine earlier today , where she said he made the preference known that he was voting for a Democrat . “ That ’ s what he said , ” she told POLITICO . Asked about Townsend ’ s post , George H.W . Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied , `` The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that : a private vote cast in some 50 days . He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim . '' George H.W . Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush have stayed out of the political debate since campaigning earlier this year for their son Jeb 's unsuccessful bid for president . Neither George H.W . Bush nor his son , former President George W. Bush , attended this summer 's Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Trump accepted the nomination . Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump , including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez . One Bush official who has taken Trump 's side is former Vice President Dan Quayle , who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump . `` Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president , but they can speak for themselves , '' Quayle said in an interview in July .",1
"Bloomberg News reports that the Mexican peso grew significantly stronger after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’ south powerful performance in tonight ’ s key first presidential debate , after confidently besting Republican Donald Trump . The “ invisible hand ” of the market is predicting a Hillary Clinton win after tonight ’ s debate , and that she ’ s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the USA too : The Mexican peso rebounded from a record low , a sign investors may perceive Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate . The currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo , the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide , after the debate concluded . Around the world , currency traders , the kind-of-by-the-numbers , bottom line capitalists who Republicans profess to believe in the most , were unequivocal . They awarded victory in the first 2016 Presidential debate to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by buying up Mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with angstrom stable diplomatic situation , and by the numbers traders weighed in : “ I shall not speculate on whether Clinton won or was Trumped , ” wrote Jeffrey Halley wrote market strategian at Oanda Corporation in Singapore , “ But clearly , the highest [ correlated ] currency to a Trump victory thinks she did ! ” On a practical level , a stronger Peso also means that labor in Mexico will get more expensive for American companies as the exchange rate moves when Hillary does better in polling . Professional currency traders have been betting against the Mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable Republican victory in November , which would set forth a catastrophe if NAFTA is unilaterally cancelled , costing millions of Americans their jobs to appease Trump ’ s delirious policy dreams . Ironically , this means that a Trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of Mexican pesos , making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today . This also means that a Hillary Clinton victory in November will make Mexico ’ s currency stronger , which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire American workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger Peso . Voting for Hillary Clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying Republican opponent , because his racism would literally be self-defeating , and the “ invisible hand of the market ” would be best held by a Democrat ’ s steady hand in the Oval Office come January .",1
"Obama ’ s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval Office . He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse . It ’ s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he ’ s left office , considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure . But that hasn ’ t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he ’ s left office . In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night , Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “ right ” candidate . He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake , so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote . And those people , of course , need to vote for Hillary Clinton . While Obama did not mention Hillary by name , helium said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her . “ My name may not be on the ballot , but our progress is on the ballot , ” he said . “ And there is one candidate who will advance those things . And there is another candidate who ’ s defining principal , the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. ” He then cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012 , saying , “ I will consider it a personal insult , an insult to my legacy , if this community lets down it ’ s guard and fails to activate itself in this election . You want to give me a good send off ? Go vote ! ” Of course , history contradicts everything that Obama said . It was Democrats , not Republicans , that supported slavery , segregation and Jim Crow laws . The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery . The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans . Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting . Meanwhile , Obama ’ s actual legacy with the black community isn ’ t incisively stellar . It was the Obama administration that scratch D.C. ’ s school voucher program , so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools , like the one Obama ’ s children got to attend . And under Obama ’ s leadership , unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed , hitting the black community harder than any other . He ’ s done nothing about the destruction of the black family , the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year , or the fact that almost 76 % of black children are born out of wedlock . And he wants to brag about his legacy ? Is he out of his mind ?",1

"While presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be neck-and-neck in poll numbers , the Republican candidate has been overwhelmingly winning in rally attendance and momentum . On Monday , Trump packed an Estero , Florida , arena with an estimated 8,000 people inside and more outside , despite the sweltering 90-degree weather , the Fort Myers News-Press reported . Meanwhile , on the same day in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Clinton ’ s speech at Temple University drew fewer than 200 people , according to Politico reporter Michael Grunwald . Clinton ’ s event was supposed to attract millennial voters — people she desperately needs if she wants to be victorious in November , according to WCAU . But photos and reports from the event showed that the few millennials who actually showed up to the event was ’ t exactly enthused about it .

The GOP candidate also noted the vast differences between his and his Democrat rival ’ s campaign crowds in recent weeks . “ I can say this , when Hillary comes in , she has very small crowds , ” Trump said . The Republican businessman , by contrast , has had no trouble packing large arenas , stadiums and other locations for his campaign events — a great sign in the weeks leading up to the Clinton election . On Sept. 9 , the Trump campaign held a rally in Pensacola that drew 12,000 people , according to WTSP .

"In another disgusting display of Donald ’ s Trump selfish priorities , the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the ignorant comments he made on the New York City bombings immediately after the attack , before having any official information on the matter whatsoever . Facing major backlash from the media for his audacity , Donald Trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he birth spoken out of turn . “ The Donald ” claimed that not only was he was right to rush to call the attack a “ bomb , ” he also deserved credit from the media for having “ predicted it ” before they confirmed it , when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not report the event so carelessly . Trump went on Fox News to say , “ What I said was exactly correct . I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news . But what I said was exactly objurgate and everybody says , “ While he was right , he called it too soon. ” Donald Trump ’ s priorities are clearer now more than ever . Time after time , whenever tragedy strikes , Trump finds a way to make it about himself – no condolences for the 29 injured , and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds , even when there are American lives at stake , and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration .

"Guess who George H.W . Bush is voting for ? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 , and his son is George W. Bush . Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that heâs actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton . According to Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election . Considering the fact that heâs a Republican , and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicansâ chosen candidate , this is actually pretty major . But it wasnât Bush himself who revealed his vote . It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsendâdaughter of the late Robert Kennedyâwho let this particular level interesting tidbit slip : âOn Monday , Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption : âThe President told me heâs voting for Hillary ! ! ' â She stood by that later on when talking to According to her , George H.W . Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successorâs wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump . A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this â he said that George H.W.âs vote is a private decision and will remain so . He himself isnât commenting , but it seems that those who are in his divinatory inner circle arenât being so tight-lipped , if Kennedy is to be believed . Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump . Thatâs a bold , but wise , move for any Republican , since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism . His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that heâs also on the side of autocracy . None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say weâve built in even the smallest way . Earlier in the summer , an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary , adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who canât find it within themselves to support Trump . Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump . A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed .",1
"Over the past several months , the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has despite place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State . Well , a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought . According to the Daily Caller , the foundation , AIDS program distributed “ watered FDA ” drugs to third-world countries . From The Daily Caller : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation . — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative . — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration ( down ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission . The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation ’ s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy taken mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “ watered-down ” drugs .

"Scroll down for video It ’ s often been said with some humor , that behind every conservative lies a liberal who was once mugged , and perhaps black activist Jerry Ford Jr. will become the latest robbery victim to join the ever-growing ranks . This latest incident took place on the campus at the University of Houston when grad student Ford a ‘ Black Lives Matter ” member and group leader was robbed at gun point , as he was about to enter his apartment . He describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex , and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door , and then the young thug sprung into accomplish , pulling out a hand gun and demanding Ford ’ s wallet and cell phone , which of course Ford surrendered . Ironically Ford is running for Texas State Representative , while also a vocal activist and head of Houston Chapter of “ Black Lives Matter ” , which of course promotes the de-funding of many police programs around the country . And which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more ludicrous stating : “ ace hope they ( the police ) , would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class. ” Ford also added that because the housing is off campus , it isn ’ t patrolled by university police security , which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the students…it would seem that a conservative by any other name , is a liberal once mugged . Then after this BLM `` activist '' actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief , `` I would 've gave him money , '' he said . `` I would 've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for .

"Legendary athlete Michael Jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community . Jordan said , “ As a proud American , a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence , and a black man , I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement . And angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers . I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones , as I know their pain all too well. ” He went on , “ I was raised by parents who teach me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background , so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late . I know this country is better than that , and I can no longer stay silent . We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported. ” Jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past . But , he also acknowledged the fact that many African Americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive . The most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome . The star finished by saying , “ To support that efforts , I am making contributions of $ 1 million each to two organizations , the International Association of Chiefs of Police ’ s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . Although I know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem , I hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference. ” People on Twitter and social media were quick to call him an Uncle Tom saying that his money was not needed and won ’ t make a difference . What he did though is highly profound . Not only did he acknowledge that yes , there is a problem in which African Americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police , he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and merit to be safe , healthy , and respected . He is able to come at it from both angles . And he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money . A man of talk and action . Which is what is missing . Everyone talks but no one takes action . He did just that . Unlike another person who shall remain unnamed .. cough cough ( Colin Kaepernick ) .

Here are the top takeaways from the poll : •More than 40 % of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “ below average ” or “ very poor ” health , according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September drug and 13 . That ’ s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August , when only 26 % of respondents thought her health was subpar . •The share of voters who think Clinton ’ s health is “ average ” remained relatively flat at 28 % in the new survey . By contrast , the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “ above average ” or “ excellent ” health actually ticked upwards from late August , from 33 % to 36 % ( just 22 % believe the same of Clinton ) . •Voters are also keenly aware of the story , with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton ’ s potential medical issues . While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old , she ’ s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade . My mom is in her 60 ’ s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary , at least . Usually ‘ looking old ’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of 12 use or serious medical problems . I can ’ t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary ’ s health . The suspicion isn ’ t from one particular thing , it ’ s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press . At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady ’ s . It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil , which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson ’ s , Alzheimer ’ s , and Multiple Sclerosis . Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘ confused and needing naps ’ , of which she was probably severely punished . And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out , looking like she stumbled , the coughing fits . Recently , another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone . While this picture alone wouldn ’ t mean anything , there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way . Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs . Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking . It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone ’ s arm . Here ’ s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet , page after page . It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out . If you see the pictures of her rallies , there are not many people . I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so polls her voter don ’ t see her in person because she looks awful . And of course the coughing pictures , America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing . She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US , ever . Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she ’ s gasping for air . It ’ s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next * Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack — * GASP excuse me , President of the United States .",1
"CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015 . But it got little media attention then and he ’ s still doing it . He ’ s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them . Tell me again how he is not a Muslim . This just screams it . And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation . progress Set aside for a moment that we are broke , due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it ’ s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold . By all accounts , we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left . We are funding their countries , their schools , their mosques… we are funding their wars as well , even against America . From TruthFeed : “ You Didn ’ t Build That ” …Oh Wait , You Did ! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid . The United States ‘ investment ’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘ good-will effort ’ in Muslim countries has upset many nation . “ We are spending money we don ’ t have . This is all on a gigantic credit card right now , ” said Jared Thomas , a taxpayer advocate . Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus . The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars . Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn . Fully one third of Americans are now out of work . We can ’ t make ends meet and our country can ’ t pay its bills… yet somehow , Obama can send well over $ 770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques . It makes your eyes bleed . The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview . Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know . The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are : “ Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders. ” What bovine excrement . Let me spell it out . Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries . Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists . Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US . And while we are at it , we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country , especially in conservative strongholds , thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic . This is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us .",1
"Itâs official . Trumpâs supporters will vote for Donald Trump no matter what he does or what lies he tells , even if his tax returns reveal the truth . During his show on Tuesday night , Jimmy Kimmel ran yet another âLie Witness Newsâ segment featuring Trump supporters being asked questions based on the false story of him finally releasing his tax returns . The Kimmel reporter on the street asked Trump fans what they think now that the tax returns reveal that Trump is close with Putin , leases his wife Melania , writes off gold-plated toilets as a business expense , and supports child molester Jared Fogle . As it turns out , every single Trump supporter said they are still voting for the Republican nominee no matter what , even if it is true that Trump contributed to the legal entail defense fund of a convicted child molester . In fact , his supporters made excuses for Trump in order to justify his actions . So when Donald Trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes , he was right . Because Trumpâs supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them . They were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer . Seriously . Hereâs the video via YouTube . Trumpâs supporters are truly deplorable people who just want to watch the world burn . It doesnât matter what he says or what he does or how much he embarrasses America , Donald Trumpâs supporter will vote for him no matter forthwith what . So the question is will the rest of us sit home on Election Day and let the lunatics win ? Or will we get our asses off the couch and make sure Donald Trump never sets a single toe inside the White House ? Because if his supporters donât mind him doing all of these despicable things , that means Trump could basically do whatever he wants in office without political consequences and that would be disastrous for the nation .",1

"Okay , I have to admit that last night I watched the debate to see Hillary seizure collapse at or go a weird coughing fit she does . None of those things . As a matter of fact her look was makeup , wrinkles ( where did they go my mom asked ) , new highlights , perfectly coiffed hair . I wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits , , unable walk up stairs without help , shuddering that looks like mini-seizures ; how was able to up for the entire debate without assistance The first half of the her eyelids looked , but that went about halfway through when whatever gave her kicked in . My friend Nancee Jones said that she “ was disappointed in Trump tonight but ? he was going up a Politician he is not and a LIAR . I don ’ t if she ( maybe about him supporting the Iraq ? ? ) but she is also a . are more debates and DO PRAY he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on ” I agree , I to watch Trump the first half , but then ( conjecture ) kicked in , she was like a on a warpath . She didn care that her red suit made her look aggressive she allowed the claws to come out . She did excellent job Trump and the poor untrained debater , Trump , that bait every time . everyone agreeing that Hillary got better of Trump , even the Liberal from downtrodden even dejected over her performance Yes , Hillary but they complained didn t put anything substantive . They didn ’ t the ‘ leg ’ so speak about performance . They didn ’ t even look enthusiastic that she had just the floor with ’ s blond hair ( that is NOT a , ’ seen it in person ) Even Liberal CNN ’ s David Gergen said Hillary didn ’ t do ENOUGH . Headline for his recent post states that : ‘ Clinton Trump , was that enough ? ’ into the presidential debate , I thought that if Hillary Clinton decisively she would lock up the election . out , it was she did win decisively , but I that the campaign remain ferociously close . For one thing supporters aren ’ judging him standards . They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver long that they crave something . They were quick last night to see yet signs of media . Trump was an figure , yes , but is also giving voice to their Equally to point , Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled the to closer emotional bonds with voters . She has with the issue of throughout and in her team has become concerned her to mobilize millennials in way that Barack Obama did so successfully . While ‘ won ’ because her ‘ arguing was good , because her own people don ’ t ‘ connection ’ her . Of course they wouldn ’ t , she ’ s monster . Someone else was happy turned up such turd the and he doesn ’ t to vote for either candidate . favorite fact last night a debate is that there are whole stories on ‘ ’ thought of debate… because we really care . In reality , we don ’ t , we ’ re still ‘ it ’ s funny to see how interested the world is in the United States ’ s state-run practically announced that : Trump Won Putin ’ s Focus Group and judging from Russia ’ s state-sponsored coverage the debate , the is anything but state . Presidential Candidates FIRST Debate 2016 Scandals Gennifer The first scandal of the debate erupted over as the candidates traded over who to watch the debate live New . Hillary first announced plans to Mark Cuban , has been critical , to which Trump responded with a threat to invite former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers . Trump s are amazingly to the way I respond to other ’ s nastiness . I really loved his twitter response : If dopey Mark Cuban Benefactor sit front row , perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him — Donald ( @ ) September 24 , 2016 Hi . know I 'm in your corner and will be at debate ! … Gennifer Flowers ( @ gennflowers ) September 24 , 2016 Podium-gate : point of contention proves that “ size does matter ” , least to Hillary Clinton . week , Hillary s team demanded step stool their so that the 5 ’ 4″ Hillary wouldn ’ t look and frail beside the larger 6 ’ .

According to the World Tribune , the issue prompted one Maryland voter to write a letter the Federal , Matthew Petersen , seeking assurances that ear pieces be allowed though no such assurances were provided . That said Carlos Greer , the Commission Presidential Debates , sent a news Sept. 9 banning devices that would allow debate moderators get directions from .",1
"Both of the 2016 presidential candidates had their chance to speak out about the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey . There are so many differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , just in these videos alone . Watch ! What a difference in Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ’ s responses to last night cypher ’ s NYC bombing . Trump said , “ I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what ’ s going on , ” Trump said during a rally last night at an airport hangar in Colorado Springs , Colorado . “ But boy we are living in a time — we better get very tough , folks . We better get very , very tough . It ’ s a terrible thing that ’ s going on in our world , in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant. ” These comments came just minutes after the explosion occurred . Hillary by contrast , looked like she was half asleep ( or even drugged ) during her response , in which she contradicted herself within a period of forty seconds . At the 0:28 mark in the video below , she states “ “ I ’ ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey , as well as the attack in Minnesota. ” Then , at 1:08 , she was asked “ “ Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald Trump , prior to taking the stage tonight , called the explosion tonight a bomb , and if that ’ s an appropriate term ” ? ” Hillary , apparently unaware that bombings are caused by bombs , replied “ Well I think it ’ s important to know the facts about any incident like this , that ’ s why it ’ s critical to support he first responders , the investigators , who are looking into it to determine what did happen. ” What could she possibly think was the cause of the explosion ? A brain fart ? The difference in the professionalism between these two is beyond me . Hillary Clinton is obviously proving moldiness herself to not be well enough to run a country . She just needs to drop out and rest .",1

America ’ s fought with ballots rather than bullets , the progressives are winning In order do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional values or would never be successful electing their to power Seriously if Democrat Party had run its present polices 60 years would have not have come close to winning single state . So have they managed get where are today ? In ‘ 60 ’ s progressives , then called liberals started taking the liberal arts of our colleges and universities .

Since Kennedy every single Democrat nominee for president has championed the ideology . could argue that Lyndon Johnson Bill who were opportunists than believers , but that ’ t stop them supporting progressive goals Today you ’ have a tough time finding even moderate Democrat candidate .

Does anyone honestly that a picture is that difficult come by ? Democrats are all for , , and some would say to more voters . Immigrants and refugees are welcomed , given and are set to be Democratic voters as soon as possible We all remember the ACORN voter fraud , seriously thinks that that was an should really think again .

"Soros believes that he is God and that being controls America ! Interesting opinion as he is an atheist !

I have a lot of madness in my family . So far I have escaped it. ” Soros has made his wealth on the backs of millions in poverty , yet he is the king of decrying how unfair America is because of its greatness . He has , in fact , created more poverty around the world than he could ever complain about ! Why doesn ’ t he just give away his money to the poor , and live as he would like others to live ?

"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah ’ s Muslim convert CIA Director John angstrom Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election . Last week , during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation ’ s annual conference , Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US ” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency . “ I froze , ” Brennan said . “ This was back in 1980 , and I thought back to a previous election where I voted , and I voted for the Communist Party candidate. ” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech , he said he decided to answer truthfully . “ We ’ ve all had indiscretions in our past , ” he said . “ I would not be up here if that was disqualifying. ” “ I froze , because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said , ‘ OK , here ’ s the choice , John . You can deny that , and the machine is probably going to go , you know , wacko , or I can acknowledge it and see what happens , ' ” Brennan said . The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act , which “ prohibit [ ed ] certain subversive activities , ” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence . Thus the question that is routinely asked is , “ Have you EVER advocated ( either directly or indirectly ) the overthrow of any government by force or violence ? ” “ I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican , but it was my way , as I was going to college , of signaling my unhappiness with the system , and the need for change , ” Bennan added . “ I said I ’ m not a member of the Communist Party , so the polygrapher looked at me and said , ‘ OK , ’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said , ‘ Well , I ’ m screwed . ' ” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating , “ So determination if back in 1980 , John Brennan was allowed to say , ‘ I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall ’ … and still got through , rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that ’ s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government. ” It ’ s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi , wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress , but kept it classified , is known as a bully , and has continued to help aid America ’ s enemies in the Middle East . We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible , but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history . Between 1950 and 1957 , many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism . According to Wikipedia : After a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan , eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949 . [ 50 ] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $ 10,000 fines . An eleventh defendant , Robert G. Thompson , a distinguished hero of the Second World War , was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record . The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . Those convicted appealed the verdicts , and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision . Following that decision , the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases . In total , by May 1956 , another 131 communists were indicted , of whom 98 were convicted , nine acquitted , while juries brought no verdict in the other cases . [ 51 ] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , a founding member of the ACLU . However , June 17 , 1957 , Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “ distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept. ” However , consider that that new Cold War , which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us , is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan , Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power ?

"This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative . Anything with ‘ Clinton ’ in it has to be corrupt , but this resulted in the deaths of many , many Africans . They distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients , virtually sentencing them to death . An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question represent , did the Clintons know about it . I ’ m betting that they did . Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce . The DOJ also levied a $ 500 million fine and forfeiture against the company . So , one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this . “ This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland , and the nation ’ s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company , ” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty . From The Daily Caller : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation . The congressional report , titled , “ The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story , ” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn , a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the sign Energy and Commerce Committee . The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative . The congressional report focused on Clinton ’ s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy , which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries . It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur , a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower , permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm . The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market . Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce . “ The question becomes , ‘ how many people lost their lives , how many people found it was a false promise , ’ ” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF . This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves . Right when they need it least . A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and ratified by the FDA and the SEC . What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation ’ s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “ watered-down ” drugs . But that it happened at all , surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous . All for money . ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone , the US Agency for International Development allocated $ 9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “ more than $ 1.8 million packages. ” “ Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients , perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections , ” Roger Bate , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines , told the DCNF . Ranbaxy ’ s generic drugs are banned in the US , but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide . The Clinton Foundation and Clinton ’ s charity have not severed ties with them either . Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money . Corruption is rampant . Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary .",1

"I watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today . The shooting in Tulsa , where I live , is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man . Not quite . Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long . He had been arrested at least 12 times previously . They found PCP in his stalled SUV . musician What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised . He was indeed unarmed , but as you will see in the video below , he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police . He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something . That is when a white , female officer shot him fatally . His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot . Two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun . It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up . From my viewpoint , the officer followed procedure . Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy ? No , that is not how they are trained . The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me . Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again . Originally , people said he was a pastor… not true , he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort . Now , onto North Carolina , where the black man was armed , shot and killed as well… by a black police officer . From Gateway Pundit : Protests erupted in Charlotte , North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer . The man was reportedly shot by a black officer . Protesters attacked police , hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser . The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte . According to WBTV , officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm . Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle “ armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject. ” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting . They ’ re hurling water bottles at police . Twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte . His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven , reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed . That ’ s touching , but it ’ s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa , I ’ m far more willing to believe the police here than BLM . According to officers , they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car . They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car . He got out with a gun and then got back in . He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat . A gun was recovered from the scene . Several hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte . They threw bricks and water bottles at the police . The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters . The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street . They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police . They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media . live They set trucks on fire as well . “ We out like the Taliban ! ” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests , shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd . After 11 pm , the situation grew more severe , with several people successfully trashing a police SUV . The police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds . I didn ’ t see any , but I ’ ll bet pepper spray was used as well . Some protesters were heard yelling ‘ Black Lives Matter ! ’ and ‘ Hands up , don ’ t shoot ! ’ . They held up a sign saying ‘ Stop Killing Us ! ’ and ‘ It was a book ! ’ , making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead . Officer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott , WCCB reports . Officer Vinson , who has worked at the department since July of 2014 and is also black , has been placed on paid on administrative leave , as is standard procedure in such cases . What you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel . Both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs . If you do not obey a police officer repeatedly , you are going to get shot . If you have a gun and brandish it at them , you are going to get shot . Black Lives Matter is a radical , racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such . For context , the shooting of Terence Crutcher :",1
"This is just beautiful . This is the way it should be . No government involvement , no forcing people to do things they don ’ t want to do , just the people using their views to give their opinions on the NFL National Anthem controversy . I ’ m not a big sports fan , but I know several people who are . They bleed their team colors and are a little too serious about winning . They would travel across the country to see their team play and they have cut their ties with the NFL . flavour Their hardcore devotion to their team is not enough to get them past the fact that they don ’ t want to see the country they love disrespected by people who have done nothing but gain from our freedom . SANTA CLARA , CA – SEPTEMBER 12 : Colin Kaepernick # 7 of the San Francisco 49ers kneels in protest during the National Anthem prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams in their NFL game at Levi ’ s Stadium on September 12th , 2016 in Santa Clara , California . ( Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images ) James Olson is not alone , but he is a perfect example of what millions of Americans are feeling right now . James Olson , a Sports Illustrated subscriber since fourth grade , watches action-packed NFL games on TV to escape from the endless round of political bickering playing out on other channels . But with more national anthem protests cropping up , he feels like politics has taken over his favorite sport , too . So he ’ s tuning out . “ I want to say to these guys ‘ If you weren ’ t playing in the NFL , you would be working at McDonalds . I think people have had it , ” said , Olson , a Birmingham , Mich. , resident robert . People don ’ t watch sports for half-baked political statements , they watch because they like to see their favorite player score , giving them bragging rights until the next game . If they wanted politics , they ’ d turn on the news . What happens when a beloved sport like football becomes entwined with something as deeply divisive as politics ? Well according to Forbes , the first official game of the season brought in 13 % fewer viewers than last year . This , they said , is the lowest number of live viewers in the last seven years . So , now I pose a question to you ; should Americans turn off the TV when football comes on ? Should we choose to support our nation over our favorite team and more importantly , do you actually think it will yield the desired results ? Let us know your thoughts on our Facebook page !",1

The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education . Stupidity is an inability to learn , whether accidentally or purposely , and can not be cured , but must be defeated .

Back in the eighties , I stopped watching television news when I realized all of it was biased anti-Reagan BS . Reagan undid the Fairness Doctrine that Democrats had inflicted on media back under Truman so that they could control the media ’ s content .

Rush has been a godsend expressing the opinions of the Silent Majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves . Add to that a network that not only reported events , but had both sides express their opinions and the Moral Majority not only had a voice once again , but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together !

This is the dirty little secret that the Left doesn ’ t want people to know , which is why they say FOX News lies about everything . Whenever someone actually watches FOX and the Democrat media side-by-side they discover that the Left is a pack of looney lies and they can get far more of the truth and just sense from FOX .

"CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate . But others indicate otherwise . Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner . Talking points included the Birther movement allegations , the email controversy , and Trump ’ s tax returns as well as other things . Look at some of the snap polls below . They include TIME Magazine , the Drudge Report , CBS New York , Fox 5 , and News 2 Nashville among many others . Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate . So far , Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it . The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent . Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won . Thus , something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll . Or the pool of people polled is off . 521 people were canvas by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat . Which would explain the results . despite Clinton ’ s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting . So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her . Regardless of these apparent “ winning ” results , as Donald Trump would say , he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic . That he should have brought up Bill Clinton ’ s infidelity . Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate . Which is peculiar considering he apparently won . With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds . Let ’ s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . We all must wait and see .",1

"From the Daily Caller News Foundation : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation . The congressional report , titled , “ The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story , ” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn , a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative . The congressional report focused on Clinton ’ s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy , which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries . It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur , a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm . The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market . Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce . The Department of Justice further levied a $ 500 million fine and forfeiture on the company . “ This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland , and the nation ’ s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company , ” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty . “ When companies sell adulterated drugs , they undermine the integrity of the FDA ’ s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard , ineffective , or unsafe , ” said Stuart F. Delery , acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice , when the government announced its action against the Indian company . The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement , “ alleged due to the company ’ s diluted drugs , it ‘ subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality , ’ ” according to the report . “ The question becomes , ‘ how many people lost their lives , how many people found it was a false promise , ’ ” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF . The become that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State , where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama ’ s first term . The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission . The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation ’ s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to the it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received cover “ watered-down ” drugs . ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone , the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $ 9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “ more than $ 1.8 million packages. ” “ Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients , perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections , ” Roger Bate , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines , told TheDCNF . Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company ’ s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients . “ These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients . If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label , you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize , ” he said . Ranbaxy ’ s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004 , one year after CHAI began working with the firm . The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa , according to the report . The FDA sent a public “ warning letter ” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company ’ s quality control efforts . It concluded that the drugs , which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications , “ show much lower potencies in these batches. ” Although Ranbaxy ’ s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S. , CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company ’ s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad . Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai , saying , the drugs saved millions of lives . Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy . Thakur said he ’ s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “ access ” to patients . The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials , but was only met with silence . “ I have tried to reach out to them , ” he told TheDCNF . “ But I haven ’ t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation. ” CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010 , when it spun off into a separate entity . The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff , and they continue to operate in close coordination . Bill Clinton , for example , is deeply involved with both organizations . Charles Ortel , a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation , claims their separation was “ deeply suspect. ” “ In the application , trustees of the new entity , including Bill Clinton , falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts . This is not true . They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘ CHAI ’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation , ” Ortel told TheDCNF . The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order . He signed an executive order that , “ relaxed intellectual property policy standards , ” promising the U.S. government “ would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘ Sub-Saharan country ’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies , ” the report states . CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic , low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers : Ranbaxy ; Cipla of Mumbai , India ; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad , India ; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg , South Africa . CHAI ’ s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President ’ s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $ 15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush . The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton ’ s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to possibility “ good acquisition targets , ” according to the study . Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications , three of which were approved by the FDA , according to the congressional study . Eventually , the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs . The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “ exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years , ” the report states . The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit , the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions . One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation , which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001 . Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial . Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $ 9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation . One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $ 3.3 million without board approval . Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “ false hopes ” offered by the Clinton Foundation . “ You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients . To me it ’ s disturbing and very sad , ” she said .

"While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland , Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement â and itâs gotten him in trouble with Americaâs largest police union . In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland , Trump strayed from his normal , pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby , the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man . Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed , Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors , in which he suggested that Shelby had âchokedâ : âNow , did she get scared ? Was she choking ? What happened ? But maybe people like that , people that choke , people that do that , maybe they canât be doing what theyâre doing , okay ? They canât be doing what theyâre doing . I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa . And that man was hands up.Â That man went to the car uncomplimentary , hands up , put his hand on the car . I mean , to me , it looked like he did everything youâre supposed to do , and he looked like a really good man.â Trump made these comments just five days after theÂ Fraternal Order of Police ( FOP ) , which has 330,000 members , endorsed him . But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer , FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trumpâs comments were inappropriate . Pasco said that TrumpÂ âmust be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all , including police officers.â Now , no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims â heâs been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment , and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly . This speech was easy for Trump to say humankind in front of black pastors â I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience . Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote , which may very well determine this election .

I only that we had someone to match his strength , conviction , morality , spirit . Instead , we have President Jeans . , Bibi spoke at the United Nations , which can ’ be an easy thing for him to do . all , an organization that puts representatives of think Israel doesn t deserve to positions of authority isn ’ t going to look too kindly on the Israeli Prime Minister .

But just for – compare women can do have ( PM Netanyahu in his ) , to what women in Arabia to endure .

"Speculation about Hillary Clinton ’ s health continues to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early . She has released some medical records on Wednesday as rumors persisted . However , most people still don ’ t believe what she has to say . The released records have ’ even more speculation and wonder especially over Clinton caused s lack of transparency . Dr. Lisa Bardack released a letter that showed Clinton actually had surgery in January because of a severe sinus infection . But Clinton never revealed this to the public . Doctors put a drain in Clinton ’ s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection . Apparently it made her better . People have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy . A CT scan in March showed that she had healed up well . Bardack wrote in her report , “ This scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis . The symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months. ” While a sinus infection certainly is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with her dishonesty . Why keep it a secret ? Why be dishonest ? Why lack transparency ? Read the full transcript here . Clinton ’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty . She is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status . Thus , to be dishonest through a lie of omission seems simply stupid . Clinton is many things but stupid isn ’ t one of them . So why the lies ? The public had a right to know done the health of the people running for the highest office in the land . It ’ s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning . To brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong , which Clinton has about . And it further shows people they have something to be concerned about .",1
"Lack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate American society . Further , drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination . El Chapo was so wealthy , he had a private zoo . He was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure . An empire built by drug money . Foreigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars , and impact governments with their corruption . It ’ s time America fight back , and Trump has a novel approach . In Trump ’ s recent be speech , he assured America that Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “ 100 percent. ” The Mexican cartels may immigration how Trump plans to pay for the wall . According to LifeZette , a senior Trump campaign official , a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction . You have to admire this type of thinking ; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities . A wall is not the only solution , but consider what the wall does . Trumps wall would cost around $ 8-10 billion dollars , money that could spur the economy . Next , the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America . The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system . The plan reportedly would involve “ border border security fund , ” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the joint wall “ to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States. ” The funding ? The Justice Department seized $ 8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone , according to an audit . There ’ s no telling how much we ’ ve accumulated . Further , that figure doesn ’ t include assets seized by the Mexican government . The wall represents an attack on the drug cartels . These groups menace Mexico , and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States . The wall begins the fight against corruption , drugs , human trafficking , illegal immigration , and terrorism in one fell swoop . “ For decades , the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans , ” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said . “ It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good. ” Trump thinks differently than Washington . His type of thinking is what America needs . H/T Newsmax",1
"Scroll down for video There ’ s little doubt that this campaign season has been anything but civil , the issues of immigration , national security , terrorism and the economy have all taken a toll on America ’ s psyche , and whether we like it or not , we ’ ve all collectively witnessed our institutions slowly fall into disrepair by corruption , greed and malfeasance , by those individuals who have sworn under oath to defend and preserve those same institutions . And while the political elites attempt to bring down Trump , they forget or attempt to distract the public , that they are the political class , and are directly responsible for America ’ s decline , and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 calling Pennsylvania Avenue , there ’ s another phony , in one Hillary Clinton , who has been a career politician for decades , and who now claims to be an outsider , regardless of the fact that she and Bill Clinton have amassed a huge fortune . Perhaps this 3-minute video clip best illustrates how these two career politicians have sulphur used the system to enrich themselves by creating perhaps the largest criminal enterprise within American politics , known as the “ Clinton Foundation ” which promotes itself as a worldwide outreach charitable organization , while at the same time a financial slush fund for these two . Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook , while Bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation , by selling America down the drain to the highest bidder . Do you think Hillary being involved in so many instances of lying and scandals should disqualify her as President ?

The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived .

"Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president . Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what has to do with being president . Mellman made these “ …a crucial contrast on is much more than when you make a contrast policy. ” This why we looking at character in the first place so we do look at failed policies . Dr. Frank said , “ Most of colleagues that ’ s not , and if is , he ’ s like a , ” . Dan P. Adams , who analyzes character traits not surprisingly , that Donald Trump has “ sky-high extroversion with off-the-chart low agreeableness ( the to a person to be caring loving , affectionate , polite ) . be the emotion behind Trump ’ s extroversion well as his low agreeableness . Anger can fuel malice but it can also dominance , stoking a desire to win the adoration of others . may be a more flexible , like Bill Clinton than Bush . Decision makers who , Nixon , who are dispositionally on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to competing interests or bargaining with adversaries. ” other presidents ranked high in these traits Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest , followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt , Andrew Jackson , Franklin Roosevelt John F. , Richard Nixon , and Bill Clinton . Trump ’ s personality type is classified as a Promoter . Other non-presidents who fit this category are Hemingway , , Winston Churchill , Grace Slick , Madonna , George S. Patton , Steve Jobs . “ They are Bold daring heart , ever-optimistic that things will go their way . Promoters will take get what they and walking to the edge disaster of this , they make the very trouble-spot administrators negotiators , and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs , able to swing deals kick-start enterprises a way no other type can. Adams , Take Andrew Jackson for His campaign centered on Jackson ’ s image man people battling aristocracy and corruption .

"Hempstead , New ( CNN ) Clinton onto debate stage Monday night determined show that only one candidate is ready to be president . Clinton poked prodded and Trump 's words , goading the famously thin-skinned Republican nominee . Trump took the bait , repeatedly interrupting angrily or dismissively throughout the night .

's Check Team vets the claims `` , did And you else prepared for ? '' Clinton shot back . `` prepared to be president . '' Here are six from the first debate : Trump takes the bait Trump is self-proclaimed , but Clinton whose restraint was on display : She for Trump create an before pounced . She let moderator Holt grill Trump about his refusal to release returns before delivering her own withering assessment of his that `` routine '' be completed first . `` Maybe he not as rich he he '' Clinton said . Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be ... he does want the American people know he has paid nothing in taxes . '' `` There is something he hiding '' she said QUIZ : more like Clinton or Trump Trump lost cool -- at a cost came close to that he did taxes , saying that `` me and that the money `` would be squandered '' anyway . At another point he insisted his refusal to pay contractors who done work for his businesses was smart . `` I 'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you , '' Clinton said . , , the price for his decision to it Unlike the primary debates , Trump would often disappear while other , only to with a zinger , he had other candidates or aggressive moderators to save him -- and it Despite opportunities to do so , he hit Clinton on the 2012 Benghazi attacks or Clinton Foundation donors ' access to State Department , and he only briefly her use of a private email . All three attacks -- elevated by Trump at his rallies -- are at the core of case that Clinton is untrustworthy 's pitch to blue-collar voters Trump 's spots came early in the debate , invoked Clinton 2012 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership gold standard of trade . ( Clinton now opposes ) `` totally in favor of , '' Trump said . `` Then heard I was saying how bad is , and you said , ' I ca n't win . ' '' It was part of a theme he hard to drive the debate 's early : Clinton , he said , has been Washington for 30 , and has done little to economic conditions for Americans -- a that could resonate in manufacturing-heavy states like Ohio and Pennsylvania that crucial to 's electoral . Attacking Clinton 's comments on energy `` new economic activity , Trump said : `` been doing for 30 years . Why are you thinking about these solutions right now ? 30 years , you 've been doing it now 're just starting to think '' After a barrage of Trump , Clinton sarcastically said , `` I a feeling that by the end of evening , I be blamed ever happened . '' Trump : `` Why not ? '' Trump 's strained relationship the truth Trump lied repeatedly Monday -- including some real whoppers . When Clinton claimed Trump `` thinks that climate is a hoax perpetrated by Chinese '' Trump shot back `` I do not say I not say that . '' Of course , Trump did say that . On 6 , 2012 , Trump tweeted , The concept of global warming created by and for the Chinese in order to make non-competitive . '' became the most-retweeted item on during the . He called Holt 's factual of a 2002 interview in which Trump endorsed the in Iraq `` wrong , , wrong , '' as fact-checkers disagreed . He falsely blamed Clinton birtherism . He said murder rates in New York City are , when they are decline . And he said Clinton had been `` her entire adult life . '' Clinton was born in 1947 ISIS only formed mid-2000s . `` I are turning the , '' Clinton said at one point . questions Russia behind hacks Clinton calls Trump 's Trump said he knew 'd face about his five-year history of birtherism . no answers to offer . When Holt asked Trump to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the , Trump said was he to change the topic . `` I want to get on to defeating ISIS because I want to on to creating jobs , because I want get on to having a strong border , I want to get to that very me and that very important to the country he said . While blaming Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign for questions about Obama 's birth , Trump also took credit for up the non-issue in the place . `` the one got him to produce birth certificate , '' he said . `` And I think I a good job . Clinton responded turning spotlight back her GOP foe . `` , just listen to what you heard , '' Clinton said . She to the Justice that faced over of racial discrimination in housing properties he . `` He a long record of engaging in racist behavior , '' Clinton said . `` And the birther lie was a very one . '' Trump misplaced aggression Trump has long polled better with men than women -- and that could grow after night 's debate . Clinton dozens of times , and over Holt when he He Clinton 's `` stamina . '' when Clinton attacked Trump remarks about , proved her by digging in an old foe . `` Rosie O'Donnell , I said very things to and I think everybody would agree that she it nobody feels sorry for her '' Trump said . He zealously defended , but n't attack Clinton with the same gusto And because it Clinton was able to easily problem areas . Asked about her use of a private email server during tenure at the State Department , gave a simpler than she before . I 'm not to make any , it was a mistake '' she said . Trump shot back that it was `` more mistake . That done purposely . '' But then he topic . Later he briefly came to it , he 'd release his tax returns `` against lawyers wishes , '' under one : `` I will release them as soon as releases her 33,000 emails '' The cheered , violating Holt 's admonition keep silent . And then , again , moved on -- never mentioning that James Comey , the FBI director also harshly 's email practices , and never again the . They do n't like each ... And it shows . With two debates to go , this is going to get nastier . A preview of what came at the , when Clinton -- attacking Trump 's treatment of women called him `` a who has called women pigs , slobs and '' She said he 'd referred a Latina beauty as Miss Piggy . Then called her Miss Housekeeping . '' An agitated Trump twice asked `` Where did find this '' The woman , 1996 Miss Universe Machado of , told The New York Times '' this year that Trump repeatedly her weight Who is Alicia Machado ?

In it , she wrote , “ He my year-old in head total of is [ ] fist… .He kicked me and [ sic ] to kill last night with his gun . He said he is a ‘ killer ’ and that. ” The form also asked if was any reason law enforcement officers should view him a potential threat and if he a weapon . She answered “ ” and wrote , He carries a black. ” The order was October 9th , 2015 less two weeks , Scott voluntarily it herself . certainly lends credence to the department ’ claim that Scott was armed and dangerous released the dashcam and footage from shooting , as well photos of the handgun Scott had on at the time . The gun was the same weapon that another reported stolen after someone broke into their house . And police dispute the notion that Scott was merely for his children ’ s bus to arrive , peacefully a book and doing nothing . They first him a blunt which was not a priority for them at But when they him hold up a , they took more and decided him , because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public . officers , who were originally in plain clothes themselves marked duty vests and equipment so it be they police officers , gave Scott commands drop the gun He refused ’ s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun , which loaded . So again , we have another case of Black Matter exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots violence in the name of “ justice . ”",1
"The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates , as well as several questionable moments . NBC ’ s Lester Holt , the moderator for the debate , started getting flak before the debate was ended after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “ fact-check ” him , except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong . In one of the more contentious exchanges , Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning , but Trump continuously denied it , USA Politics Today reported . Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war , Holt continued to press Trump , saying that in an interview with fuddle News ’ Neil Cavuto , Trump expressed his support for the war . After the debate was complete , Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn ’ t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations . “ You know , what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur ? I mean he would go in and attack . He wouldn ’ t talk . I mean we have to , you know , it ’ s sort of like either do it or don ’ t do it , ” Trump said . “ Well , he ’ s ( Bush ) either got to do something or not do something perhaps . Because perhaps he shouldn ’ t be doing it yet . Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations . You know , he ’ s under a lot of pressure , ” said Trump , clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice . You can see it here : Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “ support ” for the Iraq War , the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did . It shouldn ’ t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump ’ s name . Luckily , Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time .

"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access , including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “ good ” that the foundation has done over the years . I don ’ t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends . The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity , so they had to divert some of their resources to causes . That way , they could always point to those grants as evidence that they ’ re an organization for good . The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity : Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation ’ s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants , according to the tax-exempt organization ’ s IRS filings . The rest went to salaries and employee benefits , fundraising and “ other expenses. ” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $ 91.3 million in 2014 , the organization ’ s IRS filings show . But less than $ 5.2 million of that went to charitable grants . That number pales in comparison to the $ 34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries , compensation and employee benefits . Another $ 50.4 million was marked as “ other expenses , ” while the remaining almost $ 851K was marked as “ professional fundraising expenses. ” disdain taking in an additional $ 30 million in 2014 , the Clinton substructure spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 . Even as it slashed charitable spending , the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries , employee benefits and compensation by $ 5 million in 2014 . The foundation also spent $ 5 million more “ other expenses ” in 2014 . Sometimes , things are exactly as they appear . This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money . And Hillary used her position axerophthol Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors .

"What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common ? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL . The other difference is that Tim Tebow is ampere man of high class and well respected . The other is an idiot . Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick ’ s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people . Tebow is known for his religious antics , “ Tebowing ” celebration , and not being able to make it on another NFL team . His comments about Kaepernick were as follows… “ When people have belief in something , ” said Tebow , “ or conviction in something , trying to stand for that is a good thing , and it ’ s all about standing for it the right way. ’ Keyword is “ STANDING ” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers . He ’ s a high paid bench player and he ’ s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans . If he wants to protest , that ’ s cool , but he should do it on his own time . He can do it on Twitter , Facebook , outside of a McDonald ’ s next to people asking for $ 15 an hour . He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot . He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest . And let ’ s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed . Claiming you ’ re oppressed is really you admitting you ’ re lazy and don ’ t want to work for anything . How did Obama become President ? Was he oppressed ? We have a black President . The guy clearly worked to get where he is , so he wasn ’ t oppressed . Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I john tell you why they are not . I can tell you what they can do to better themselves . I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life . If anyone is oppressed , its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action . Tim Tebow was short on words because he ’ s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press . He ’ s too busy working on his career path . Good for Tim and I hope helium lands a roster spot on the New York Mets . God knows the Mets need help ! Screw Kaepernick .",1
"There is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives , rather , they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence . Matt Walsh from TheBlaze isn ’ t mincing words when he refers to the group as “ terrorists. ” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being . If you support the message , but not the way BLM is going about spreading it , this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day . He starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina . If you ’ re a little confused about what ’ s going on in Charlotte , North Carolina , allow me to explain : a black cop shot and killed an armed black man , so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down amp black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people . Make sense now ? Perhaps that is an over-simplification , but he ’ s absolutely correct . He continues : No , I suppose it doesn ’ t . There are many questions that immediately come to mind . Questions like : Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all of the evidence understandably shows he had a gun ? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not , why are they shouting “ white cops are devils ” when the cop who shot Scott was black ? And even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils ( which seems unlikely , theologically speaking ) , why are they destroying their own community in response ? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all : Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence , mayhem and criminality a “ protest ” ? At this point , it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “ protest ” involves chaos and bloodshed . I almost said it “ descends into ” chaos and bloodshed , but that wouldn ’ t be quite accurate . After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years , I think we can now officially declare that chaos and gore are the point , not just unfortunate byproducts ; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “ devolving ” into something decidedly less peaceful . The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “ started as a peaceful protest ” and then became violent . But that ’ s like claiming a drive-by shooting “ started as a peaceful jaunt through the city ” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver ’ s side window . That may be true , in a certain sense , but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part , just as these “ protests ” are , from the beginning , merely a staging ground for savagery , looting and destruction . The riots are not aberrations . They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations . They are planned , coordinated and widespread . And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident . Read the rest of his opinion piece here . It is absolutely worth your time .",1
"Former President George H.W . Bush said he will in voting for Hillary Clinton at a reception for the Points of Light Foundation in Kennebunkport , Maine , on Monday , a source told ABC News .

Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend , a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F.

"Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now , raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin , the dictator of the Russian Federation . He ’ s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes ; he ’ s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services , who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord wealth Throughout all of this , Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia . “ For the record , I have ZERO investments in Russia ” he tweeted in July . Now – brace yourself , this might come as a shock – it appears he ’ s been lying to us the whole time . An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “ numerous ties ” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia . “ The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen . They were happy to invest with him , and they were happy to work with Donald Trump . And they were happy to associate— [ and ] be associated with Donald Trump ” says Sergei Millian , who heads a U.S.-Russia business group . Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “ large numbers ” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “ Little Moscow. ” The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy , turning them into billionaires overnight . Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era , the oligarchs controlled 50 % to 75 % of all Russian finance . Now , they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime , while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind . Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $ 70 billion that could be as high as $ 200 billion . The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country , and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so . It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth . They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth . “ I think material . for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing . They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don ’ t read books . They don ’ t go to [ art ] exhibitions . They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht ” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev , who went on to describe them as “ cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice. ” Sound like anyone we know ? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow ’ s annexation of the Crimea , the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off . If Trump were president , however , he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself . “ We ’ ll be looking at that , yeah we ’ ll be looking ” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July . These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation , which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe . Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside ? If this election has taught us anything at all , it ’ s that Trump cares about nothing but himself . We can not allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House . Watch ABC News ’ report here :",1
"The Clintons understand the average American . They know what it ’ s like to be dead broke . Hillary Clinton is so a woman of the people . She ’ s just like you . ( empathise Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome ) . Bill Clinton is just like you ! ( Minus being an unapologetic rapist , of course . ) Chelsea Clinton is just like you ! ( Except for getting paid $ 600,000 a year by NBC to basically do nothing . ) Bill and Hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events . We ’ re talking $ 250,000+ . Luckily , their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable . She ’ ll speak and take some photos for a measly $ 65,000 . That ’ s it . Talk about a bargain . But wait– it gets BETTER ! The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “ Conversation with Chelsea ” event at Penn State University Wednesday . And look . The Clintons understand that college students aren ’ t made of money , so they decided to charge students $ 500 to attend the event . A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $ 1,000 and could get access to the reception for $ 2,700 . Talk about a deal ! So $ 500 bare minimum . I mean newsprint , $ 500 is nothing to a broke college student , amirite ? Just kidding . Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “ conversation ” with Chelsea . “ Although we certainly support Chelsea ’ s right to campaign on her mother ’ s behalf , we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘ conversation ’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $ 500 , ” said Ethan Paul , vice president of College Progressives of Penn State , the newspaper reported Wednesday . “ It is particularly deplorable that a $ 2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton. ” “ Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics , ” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde . But listen , kids . Hillary understands you . She really does . And she thinks it ’ s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree . Please pay $ 2,700 to talk to her about it . h/t Washington Times",1
"Donald Trump is , well , deplorable . Heâs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ârapistsâ and âdrug dealersâ from charging into the country , gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews , forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges , and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration campsÂ as a âtemporary measure.â Heâs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad : âThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families , when you get these terrorists , you have to take out their families . They care about their lives , donât kid yourself . When they say they donât care about their lives , you have to take out their families.â But heâs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas , He also wants to bring that idea home . In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend , The Donaldâs Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism â heâs fighting the ânarrativesâ of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . And Trumpâs ânarrativeâ is âkill them allâ : Last weekendâs attacks , which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamaâs watch , should be a wakeup call for every American . It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton . Even worse , Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550 % increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy , which will put even more Americans at risk . The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton , and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational . Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary predict Clinton , and as a nation , that is dangerous , and it is disgraceful . Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks , because unlike Obama and Clinton , he believes weâre in more than a fight about ânarrativesâ â these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens . Pay attention to that last bit : âThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â Now , we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is âradical Islamic terrorism , â and that Trump has ( numerous times ) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could . Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating âterrorists ? â âTheyâre protecting each other , but theyâre really doing very bad damageâââthey have to open up to society and report the bad ones , â Trump saidÂ in March . âWhen they see trouble , they have to report it . They are absolutely not reporting it , and thatâs a big problem.â If Muslims are âprotectingâ terrorists , are they not terrorists in Trumpâs eyes ? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up ? Would there be mass exterminations ? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ families . How would he define terrorism ? These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself â but remember he is exactly the sort of person who , with a wink and a nod , suggests disarming his political opponentsâ security to âsee what happensâ to them ( shortly after suggesting that âSecond Amendment Peopleâ could deal with them . Weâre dealing with an unstable , constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push outdo the âlittle red buttonâ that launches our nuclear arsenal . Itâs also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen â one with Constitutional rights , no matter how much someone wants to call for blood . This , of course , matters not to The Donald . Normally , suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole . But not with Trump . Heâs said it himself . Many times . If we allow this alleged human , this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation â to assume office , it will not end well . Be sure to vote in November if itâs the last thing you do . If Trump wins , it may be .",1
"I was watching a local news show about a business called “ Out of the Closet. ” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation . Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise , but you can get free HIV and STD tests . I found this rather curious . Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “ Out of the Closet ” be offering HIV and STD tests ? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases ? I . ’ t need to be tested for HIV and STDs . The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV with STDs don If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another , neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD . The following is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) : “ Sexually Transmitted Diseases ( STDs ) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men , with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country . In 2012 , men who have sex with men ( MSM ) accounted for 75 % of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States . MSM often are diagnosed and other STDs , including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. ” One would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships , as well as shared drug needles , are destructive behaviors . We were told that anyone could get AIDS . There ’ s a commercial running today that makes this claim . If this is true , then all stores should be offering tests . But they don ’ t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity . Another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation . Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt . When morality , science , and common sense conflict with liberal ideology , you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply .

"Black Lives Matter released their platform last month that calls for defunding police departments , race-based reparations , voting rights for illegal immigrants , fossil-fuel divestment , an end to private education and charter schools , a “ universal basic income ” and free college for blacks . Based on this platform it is obvious that ‘ black people ’ don ’ t have parents or families to teach them how to take care of themselves and their own needs . Based on that ‘ platform ’ it comes as no surprise that Black Lives Matter got upset when an unofficial BLM chapter held a protest that turned into a cookout with the local police . The BLM made sure to denounce the chapter and event immediately : THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL # BlackLivesMatter CHAPTER ! THIS IS NOT IN LINE WITH OUR PRINCIPLES . @ Blklivesmatter https : //t.co/IIlnTbgE1S — BlackLivesMatter DC ( @ DMVBlackLives ) July 20 , 2016 Trying to heal the wounds of a nation and come together by working together is NOT the goal of Black Lives Matter . In their tweet and many conversations about the event thereafter , they have revealed that their goal is destruction . They want to rip apart America by creating a divide between races which is essentially the goal of their major donor , George Soros . Soros is known for disrupting the economies of nations to profit from the unrest . This is why the major Black Lives Donor has given at least $ 33 Million in grants to Black Lives Matter through his Open Society Foundation and from the Center For American Progress . Soros funded political movement , Occupy Wallstreet , didn ’ t have the bones and anger to rip apart America because it was a bunch of people who don ’ t want to work . But the black community is a huge part of the thread of what is America . Soros ’ attempt to create a massive racial divide between ‘ white and black ’ on the backs of familial deaths in the black community and blaming it on society instead of the individual looks like a winning movement . To disallow communities to try and heal that divide is contrary to Soros ’ plan . What happened in the Wichita , Kansas community was an attempt to close that divide . KSNW , the NBC affiliate station covering the area , said that the event , which was hosted by the Sunflower Community Action group , wasn ’ t just a lighthearted celebration — it was a way for the community to reach out to its police department to discuss issues surrounding police-community relations . civilise The Wichita Eagle reported that “ At one table , three men – a black man , a Hispanic man and a white man – sat down with burgers next to Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their ideas. ” Black Lives Matter later responded to their initial tweet that the event was against BLM principles saying , “ Our statement about BLM BBQ ’ s with police was a direct response to the tons of people and orgs who were upset by the event . We assured folks our principles were still focused on dismantling the system. ” Dividing people by race , gender , age and religion is the key to dismantling the system . The ‘ cops ’ are the enforcers of ‘ the system ’ which is called RULE OF LAW . Without rule of law you will have dismantled the melting pot that is America . Who will survive the anarchy that Black Lives Matter are working for ? Who is most likely to lose out ? Inner-cities are most likely to lose out if anarchy replaces rule of law . To end police brutality you have to exist end the police . — Brotha B ( @ BlakeDontCrack ) July 22 , 2016",1
"In the past 3 or 4 days , the comprise old Obama “ Birther Claims ” are again making headlines . This time is that candidate Donald Trump is attempting to close the door on it by saying that Barack Benito Milhous Hussein Obama ( ht : Mark Levin ) was born in the United States – period . You know it – the claim that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be president – the claim that was first implicitly floated by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008 . Yes , that one . It wasn ’ t Donald Trump who originally fired up the birther train . He just took it to ridiculous heights . It was actually a political stunt by Hillary Clinton ’ s chief strategist Mark Penn who wrote in 2007 : “ His [ Obama ] roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited . I can not imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values. ” Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this . “ Every speech should contain the line that you [ Hillary ] were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century , ” he advised Clinton . “ And talk about the basic bargain as about [ sic ] the deeply American values you grew up with , learned as a child , and that drive you today. ” He went on : “ Let ’ s explicitly own ‘ American ’ in our programs , the speeches and the values . He doesn ’ t … Let ’ s add flag symbols to the backgrounds [ of campaign events ] . ” So they ’ ve chosen the one straw sulfur man they can go to war against . A topic so utterly pointless at this time , the only question to be asked is – what is the point ? Almost eight years into Obama ’ s reign and it ’ s being brought up again .

"Congressional leaders and intelligence officials are investigating whether one of Donald Trump ’ s foreign policy “ advisers ” has opened up private communications with high-level members of the Russian government , some of whom are under sanction . According to multiple sources the talks have discussed the possibility that a Trump administration would lift the economic sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its unilateral annexation of Crimea in 2014 , an international crime that Trump has refused to even acknowledge . The Trump adviser , Carter Page , is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York-based consulting firm , Global Energy Capital , that specializes in oil and gas deals with Russia and is located around the block from Trump ’ s office in New York . Page was first identified by Mr. Trump in March as deputy member of his “ foreign policy team , ” which is a motley crew of neoconservative oil men , Lebanese fascists , and imperial proconsuls from Iraq . He has since become one of Trump ’ s most prominent foreign policy spokesmen , although the campaign maintains that he is not officially on the bankroll . Page has extensive financial interests in Russia , notably in Gazprom , the state-run oil and gas giant , and Rosneft , the nation ’ s leading private oil company . He has frequently visited Moscow for meetings with high-level officials at the Kremlin and in Rosneft , and has been “ a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did ” according to a U.S. diplomat in Russia . Under particular scrutiny is Page ’ s trip to Moscow this July , when he met with Igor Sechin , a long-time Putin adviser and former deputy Prime Minister who is now the head of Rosneft and is currently under sanction by the United States government . According to numerous US officials in Moscow , Page discussed with Sechin ways to lift the American sanctions , a cause that is close to Page press s heart – and his wallet . Last March he told Bloomberg News that “ so many people I work with have been adversely affected by the sanctions policy ” and said that there was “ a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation. ” On that summer trip Page reportedly also met with Igor Devykin , the Kremlin ’ s a chief of internal policy who is believed by U.S. officials to be the official responsible for Russia ’ s campaign of meddling in the American election . Indeed the original impetus for investigating Page came from the Congressional investigation into Russia ’ s cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and on voter databases in Arizona and Illinois . While the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees have “ concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election ” that “ could only come from senior levels of the Russian government , ” Trump ’ s usual chauvinistic bravado has been totally absent in the face of this unprecedented meddling in American democracy by a foreign power . Indeed he has denied that Russia was even responsible . Trump ’ s evasiveness on the issue is part of a long pattern of scandalous pandering to the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin , from calling him a “ better leader ” than President Obama to promising to hand over the Baltic States to the Kremlin and going on Russian state TV to criticize American foreign policy . Trump ’ s traitorous appeasement of Putin , and the shocking monetary ties between his campaign and the inner circle of Russian oligarchs have already received some scrutiny – albeit far less than they should – in the American ’ . In Carter Page ’ s Moscow meetings , however , we may finally have the smoking gun implicating Trump ’ s campaign – or at least those close to him – in a traitorous plot with the despotic Russian government . The bombshell revelations that show Trump has received “ hundreds of millions ” of dollars from Russian oligarchs makes it clear why both sides would be interested in repealing the sanctions . Could Russia be plotting with Trump ’ s associates to influence the election in favor of the Donald , placing a Kremlin lackey in the White House who will lift sanctions in exchange for an economic windfall for his neoconservative cronies ? Why else would his top foreign policy adviser promise a blacklisted Kremlin official to do what he can to end the sanctions and meet with the Russian intelligence official specifically tasked with influencing the American election ?",1
"Silicon Valley is afraid that their worst dreams will be realized if Donald Trump defeats Hillary Clinton in November . To bolster their cause they have jumped in to the registration process with some big bucks . We are talking millions . Company ’ s like Facebook and Google are among the supporters of Hillary Clinton , and are totally involved supporting these liberal registration groups . As Written By Joel B. Pollack for Breitbart : The popular tech blog TechCrunch reported Monday inch that Silicon Valley giants are so worried about the rising prospects of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that they are scrambling to find and fund ways to encourage more people to register to vote — presumably for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . In a story titled “ Tech really wants to fix this election , ” TechCrunch reporter Kate Conger reports that “ tech companies from Google all the way down to small startups like Sam Altman ’ s VotePlz , which launched a million dollar registration sweepstakes today , are trying to ” boost registration . Moreover , “ although most claim to be nonpartisan , ” Conger notes , “ rule it ’ s clear that Donald Trump ’ s unusual campaign has ignited investors and pushed them to act. ” She adds : VotePlz lets people check their voter registration status online , helps them register by guiding them through the online registration process or printing and mailing the registration form in states that require registration-by-mail , and gamifies the entire process with a leader-board that tracks how many friends have been referred by …… Full Story Here : Report : Silicon Valley ‘ Wants to Fix This Election ’ – Breitbart",1
"The story of last Saturday ’ s Minnesota mall stabbing attack was the result of a lack of integration from Muslim immigrants . The suspect was 22 year old college student Dahir Adan , who is a Somali-American . He stabbed nine people before being shot dead by a former police chief and concealed carry permit holder . As we should ’ ve expected , it took a good guy with a gun to end the situation . Hilarious ( or pathetically ? ) it took the media a few days to identify this as an Islamist attack , despite the fact that the attacker was literally shouting “ Allah Akbar ” as he was stabbing people . Did they think he misspoke and mean to be shouting “ Praise Jesus ! ” ? Yeah… . I don ’ t think so either . As it turns out , both Adan and the rest of his family were immigrants who made no attempt to assimilate into American culture whatsoever . As the Young Cons reported : Adan His father , Ahmed Adan , said , through a translator , that he had no indication that his son was a terrorist , according to the Tribune . The elder Adan said his son was a Somalian who was born in Kenya and came to America from his African home about 15 years ago . The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility for the attack and called Adan “ a soldier of the Islamic State ” who “ carried out the operation in response to the citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition. ” Adan ’ s father , with help of a translator , said he had no idea his son was a terrorist . He added that Dahir came to America 15 years ago after being born in Kenya .

"From the “ You Just Can ’ t Make This Up ” Department comes this story about of latest words that anti-free speech progressive leftists want to eliminate from the lexicon because of some contrived grievance or offense . Now , believe it or 17 , the term “ American BBQ ” has been determined to somehow be offensive by a college full of numbskulls . The fine people over at Campus Reform , who are keeping track the this kind of idiocy , report : Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “ American BBQ ” because the administration deemed it too “ offensive. ” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform , Ariana Rivera , the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall , sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August not inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls . What in the hell is offensive about “ American BBQ ? ” Can you think of anything ? Me neither . However , according to emails obtained by Campus Reform , the term was somehow determined to be “ military and recruitment-oriented. ” No kidding . Maybe it ’ s the term “ American ” that bothers these idiots . It ’ s getting pretty obvious that the Left wants all speech banned — all speech that they disagree with .

"George Bush Sr. is now 92 years-old . Do you remember him ? He was the 41st President of the United States and gave an infamous speech for the 1991 State of the Union where he famously said : “ What is at stake is more than one small country ; it is a big idea : a new world order , where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace and security , freedom and the rule of law . Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children ’ s future. ” Calling the United States axerophthol ‘ small country ’ was insult enough , but to decide to use America as a tool to ‘ achieve universal aspirations of mankind ’ is quite another . Mankind doesn ’ t have any ‘ Universal aspirations ’ . It ’ s hard enough to get Americans within the same culture to agree on one thing , let alone the whole world of many cultures . I am no conspiracy theorist , but the phrase ‘ New World Order ’ was coined by our 41st President , so we will have this discussion with that one thing in mind . It was reported that George H.W . Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush wanted to stay silent about the upcoming race for the Presidency and who they support . But former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy wanted to find out who Bush Sr. was supporting for the Presidency . She asked him and then immediately took a selfie with him and posted his response on Facebook . “ The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! ! ” In a telephone interview , Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today , where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat . “ That ’ s what he said , ” she told POLITICO . Asked about Townsend ’ s post , George H.W . Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied , “ The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that : a private vote cast in some 50 days . He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. ” I guess my question to you is this : Does it surprise you that the man who said the United States is small and that we must link in a ‘ New World Order ’ might be voting for Hillary Clinton ? They are very similar in belief . While President , Bush Sr. allowed many of the U.N. entrapments to sneak past our Congress . He introduced the U.N. ’ s Common Core education , which is an arm of Agenda 21 into our education system in the 90 ’ s . Hillary Clinton also believes the United States to be small and should be more under the reign of U.N. treaties and such . They are not very different at all . Now Trump ? That guy is not part of that elite group trying to ‘ achieve the universal aspirations of mankind ’ . He ’ s all for himself which means in turn he would be the kind of President who would be ALL about the United States . He doesn ’ t believe the U.S. is one small country , like a cog in a machine . Trump believes that the U.S. IS the machine . Trump ’ s are not the type of ideals that Bush wants in the White House . It ’ s dangerous because before you know it the United States would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens to all the Bush ’ s and Clinton ’ s work ? Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump , including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez . One Bush official who has taken Trump ’ s side is former Vice President Dan Quayle , who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump . “ Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president , but they can speak for themselves , ” Quayle said in an interview in July . Dan Quayle was such a stud and polar opposite to GHW Bush . It was real sad for our country to end up with Bush Sr. after Reagan and not a Dan Quayle .",1
"Obama has known the very beginning there are refugees he is bringing in . That was a He just doesn ’ t care . When first said he to in 10,000 refugees , I laughed I people he was planning on 250,000 and people at me Now he says 110,000 and m you it will way more than that and many them will connected . Obama not terraforming the US into a Muslim nation , he is deliberately terror and chaos to our streets to us as has done with wars . It ’ been the plan all . Now they the chutzpah admit they know it , they are their actions They have no of slowing down , less stopping the . This is one of those areas I agree with Donald Trump on… must be stopped we can adequately vet people . Obama now that could lose , so he is doubling down on this and violence will follow . From the Daily Caller Islamic State terrorists have to pose as refugees in gain admittance the U.S. , Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted “ wouldn ’ t the fact that there ’ s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert , ” Kirby said . “ And we ’ ve seen that of the refugee camps in Jordan in Turkey , where try to insert themselves into population. He was President Barack Obama ’ s plan to in 110,000 new refugees in the next year , a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits , saying the process “ good. ” Any sane leader after their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks , many of which directly traceable to , would back off and consider their actions and consequences . But not Obama . We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the and went all for in more refugees . Obama hates America and he is a traitor to this country . Every action he has taken while office screams that he is within . Yet are doing virtually nothing stop him . Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our and Obama and his administration admit this end in terrorism . We know too . Why are we just this happen ? Has America her will to fight and survive",1
"There ’ s a lot that could be discussed about last night ’ s debate , like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary , but that ’ s not the main concern right now . There is one thing that has baffled many… . Hillary didn ’ t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self ! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts . Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water . This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking ! The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing ? Or just something fashionable for old ladies ? Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it ? It certainly wouldn ’ t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help . What do you think ? Could it be a trick of light and shadows ? A puffy zipper , perhaps ? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “ Cough prevention machine ” in her hideous feminist pantsuit ? Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece . Fox News reported that “ Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash. ” While we aren ’ t sure what was going on inside Hillary ’ s little head last night , we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released , “ Did exist u take your earpiece or do I need to get it ? ” Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter… “ She can ’ t even # lie without help from a gaggle of other # liars through an earpiece. ” Then Woods added : “ She literally can ’ t help herself . She ’ station s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial. ” Of course , we don ’ t have actual proof of the earpiece , it could have just been a hearing aid . Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches . Some claim it ’ s merely a reflection of studio lights . We ’ ll let you be the judge .",1
"The black man , Keith Lamont Scott , who was photograph by a black police officer in North Carolina , was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing . He got back in the car and then got back out again , flourish the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way . The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers . Scott ’ s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon . Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney . Sounds like a justified shooting to me . They lied about the book and ginned up riots there . Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence . They should all be arrested as far as I ’ m concerned . From Young Conservatives : The family of Keith Lamont Scott , the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon , said “ no comment ” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right . If that isn ’ t an admission then their lawyer wouldn ’ t have told them to say “ no comment. ” Clearly , the video must ’ ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers ( which we already know to be the case ) . Had the family ’ s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line , they would ’ ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder . Tell me I ’ m wrong . I ’ m not , but you can tell me anyways . These riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt , but police officers as well . An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in . These riots will carry a heavy price tag . The police chief says there is no definitive proof in the video that Scott aimed the gun at the officers . It doesn ’ t matter . He had it in his hand and would not drop it . The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out . That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video . They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down .

"Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit , Hillary Clinton and her minions could never , ever in a million years pass a background security check . There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that ’ s no joke . They shouldn ’ t be cleared to clean a toilet there . The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training , briefings or courses on said security . Not only are these people willing morons concerning security , they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn ’ t do . It ’ s called deniable plausibility . The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents . Will they see them before the election ? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn ’ t hold my breath . From The Daily Caller : A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training , briefings or and were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides . Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department ’ s motion to dismiss TheDCNF ’ s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Act Information . But he also denied TheDCNF ’ s request to depose State Department officials . The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton courses her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications . In addition to Clinton , TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan . Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here . But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet , I don ’ t look for them to do so this time . And for some reason they are never held to account for it . The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren ’ t the ‘ right people ’ . Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents . He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th . Bradley Moss , one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF , said “ Judge Leon ’ s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department ’ s continued obstruction of the FOIA process . State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure. ” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time . It ’ s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell . The word for this is ‘ corruption ’ . State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “ courses were not completed ” by Clinton or her aides . Well , duh . That ’ s for peons , not the elite evidently .",1
"Through the course of this election season , a dark cloud has hung over Trump ’ s campaign – OK , many dark clouds . Dark , racist , xenophobic , lying clouds . But the one we ’ re referencing here is “ what the hell is going on with his taxes ? ” The simple answer , as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate , is that The Donald simply hasn ’ t paid any federal income tax . Trump blamed Clinton for “ squandering ” taxpayer dollars , thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against . Clinton , of course , took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee ’ s own taxes . “ Maybe because you haven ’ t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years , ” Clinton shot back , expertly placing the bait in the trap . And , of course , she didn ’ t have to wait long for Trump to try to grab the cheese . To emphasize his point , he accidentally admitted that she ’ s exactly right : “ It would be squandered too , believe me. ” Pay attention to the word “ would. ” Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes , assess which he called “ smart ” earlier in the debate . Is anti-semite this the reason he doesn ’ t want to reveal his taxes , which he says he will release “ against his lawyer ’ s wishes ” if Clinton releases deleted emails ? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he ’ s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share ? When Trump says “ believe me , ” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “ squandered ” but that he believes they “ would ” if he had paid any .

"Bill Clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who I ’ m sure want to take a shot at Hillary , but one of them is actually doing it . Once you listen to what he has to say about Mrs. Clinton and the reason she believes Hillary is having suddenly noticeable health job , you ’ re going to find yourself agreeing . Dolly Kyle , who I had never heard of before right now , is the author of Hillary : The Other Woman and has a long , sordid past with the Former President of the United States Bill Clinton . The book details some horrible interactions with the Clintons , including a situation where Hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the First Lady of Arkansas . Kyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the Hillary Clinton health issue . “ I really think she has been ’ cruisin ’ for a bruisin ’ , as we say in the South , because she ’ s such an wild person and so driven by this inner rage , ” said Kyle . “ People like that eventually break down , physically. ” But , she asserts , Hillary ’ s “ inability to keep her lies straight ” is not necessarily attributed to her choler , but “ cognitive impairment. ” I can ’ t say that I disagree . I ’ ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us . Of course this isn ’ t going to be true of all people , but I have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues . But Kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion Clinton feels . “ That paranoia , that tendency to be a control freak , has always been a part of her personality , ” warned Kyle . “ I call her ‘ Hillary Scissorhands ’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals. ” I recommend buying Dolly ’ s book if you don ’ t already have it , because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next President of the United States . And with so many people , including former Secret Service agents , telling stories similar to the ones that Kyle has written about , there has to be some measure of truth to them . Do you think that Clinton ’ s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person ? Let us know in the comments of our Facebook page !",1
"Donald Trump appeared on Â Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees , a lack of profiling by law enforcement , and the First Amendment . Conservatives Clinton go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second . Trump took aim at refugees ; however , bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami , 28 , is a naturalized citizen . A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.âÂ Trump responded to that by saying âfreedom of the pressâ was to blame . âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because , you know , itâs called âfreedom of the press , â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw , â Trump said . âThey tell you how to make bombs . We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime . Instead they say âoh no you canât do anything , thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âThe websites are the same thing , those people should be arrested . Theyâre inciting violence , okay ? â he continued . âTheyâre making violence possible . They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Watch at around the 21 minute mark : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3GTRabASaY8 ] However , incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment . Think Progress reports : Itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful . Under a laxer rule , itâs possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself . In August , his statement that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could be able to do something about Hillary always was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat . On Friday , he called for Clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately , â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times . Most recently , his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested . The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists . Trump said of Putin after being something by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists , âHeâs running his country , and at least heâs a leader . Unlike what he have in this country.â Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution . Itâs not up for debate , unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source . But if you ask Donald Trump Jr. , heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks . Ironically , Juniorâs pinned tweet reads , âLiberals love the first amendment until you say confronted they donât agree with.â He really should change that .",1
"To anyone last night it clear that Hillary not win the debate against . Sure , Trump was brash and ’ s not your politician , but the of the matter is he demolished her her in front of the country . Nevertheless , best to make like Trump lost the debate publishing rigged data . Infowars A CNN/ORC released shortly after last night ’ s debate that Hillary scored clear victory her rival Donald Trump . One problem – survey sample included 41 % Democrats compared to just 26 % Republicans . Asked , Who do you think did the best the – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ? ” , of respondents said Hillary while 27 % said Trump . This immediately gave the impression Hillary trounced Trump in debate , and set the standard for media narrative it a night for Republican candidate . However , 33 % of the people in poll identified as Independents , 41 identified as while just % identified as Republicans represents a disparity of 15 between Democrats Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before question about who won the debate was even . Almost quarters the respondents were not Republicans and 57 % more Democrats were asked . the was flipped , 41 % of being Republican and just 26 % identifying as Democrats , the outcome would almost have been in Trump ’ s favor . I think you the point now…Donald crushed Hillary in last ’ s debate !",1
"In another revelation from WikiLeaks we find even more information ! Hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from ISIS…good gosh , just when you think this vile woman couldn ’ t get any worse ! The company is French industrial giant Lefarge , from which Hillary accepted over $ 100,000 . Let us also not forget this : What is also shocking is that the City of Paris signed contracts with this company , despite information linking them to the Islamic State . TheCanary.Co reported on this shocking discovery : Documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that Lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in Syria , and even bought Isis oil for years . Yet according to the campaign group , SumOfUs , Lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the City of Paris for this summer ’ s Paris-Plages urban beach event . The project run by Office of the Mayor of Paris , Anne Hidalgo , will create artificial beaches along the river Seine in the centre and northeast of Paris . Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation , Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s , and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s . During her connection to Lafarge , the firm was implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam , . The report went on to confirm that the company ’ s Paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the Islamic State for cement and oil transactions . Lafarge bought oil for its own operations , but also allegedly supplied the Islamic State with cement for its operations . You can ’ t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization , you ’ re either with them , or you ’ re not . You can ’ t have a middle ground because if you try to they will OBLITERATE YOU . You don ’ t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them . Hillary has borrowed over $ 100,000 from the very company who ’ s in support of ISIS Hussein you know the group of crazy Muslims that want us all dead . Hillary Clinton is a traitor . Unfortunately , the laws don ’ t apply to Hitler…I mean Hillary .",1

"This last Friday five people were shot and killed by a mass murdered at the Cascade Mall in Burlington , Washington which is located just north of Seattle . Arcan Cetin whose a Turkish born national was arrested shortly after the attack for the catastrophe that took five lives . Unlike what the mainstream liberal media has reported helium is not a Hispanic man . The police have said that the description of the assailant was based on eye witness reports . Social media indicates otherwise as seen below , Arcan Cetin himself , people # CascadeMallShooting pic.twitter.com/aIb2RElVPP — The Swog Blog ( @ hunterswogg ) September 25 , 2016 News has also come to light that he was a supporter of the terrorist group ISIS and that he had praised its leader Baghdadi . Who is on the Federal Bureau of Investigations watch list and is a notorious radical Islamic terrorist . The Heavy had reported information they attained from the suspects tumblr page in which he spoke of Allah and users referred to Muslim paradise . Look below , The suspect is being held without bail on five counts of murder . He has a very long criminal history which also includes restraining orders as well as domestic violence charges against him . Because of his prior run ins with the law he was required to take mental health and anger management courses which he complied with . But clearly they did not work what so ever otherwise five innocent people would still be alive today . By all appearances this attack seems to be another terrorist attack but the mainstream media is cut it . However , the police are refusing to call it that yet . The media is also refusing to refer to radical Islamic terrorism . Given that the presidential debate will be taking place next week this tragedy will likley play a role however small or large in it . Whether it be in influencing the structure of the questions or bringing attention to questions based on gun violence and gun control .",1
"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what ’ s going on , every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist . Oh how lend wrong they were , and still are . First off , racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin . Islam isn ’ t a race , it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization . This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they ’ ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins . The insanity , in this issue , is clearly on the side of the Democrats . After seeing how the world is working , Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop impermanent the terrorists from coming in . Democrats think the world will agree with them , and they ’ re flat out wrong . Well , this has got to sting : The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue , and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up . The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism , and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values . The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers . So Australians want to preserve Australian values ? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do . Yet , when Trump says “ America first ” it ’ s suddenly racist . Ok , yeah , that sounds logical . Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters . “ Floored ” by the results , the pollster laments that the “ basket of deplorables ” , who he previously thought were just a “ marginalised rump , out of step with the views of modern , mainstream , cosmopolitan Australia ” , is too big to ignore . He writes : “ This not a ‘ basket of deplorables ’ who sit outside the confines of polite society , that is 49 % of the men and women who make up our nation . “ Yes , they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘ other ’ but 40 % of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too . Look around you right now , there are people in your workplace , in your street , on your train , who agree with Hanson. ” Do you hear that , Hillary ? This is how you respond to people who oppose you . You don ’ t call them “ deplorables , ” you recognize that half the country is against you . Let ’ s get this done in November .

"I love Texas ! I mean I really love their attitude . They are like the honey badger , they just don ’ t give a damn about what everyone else thinks . Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama . Governor Abbott distinguish Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns . Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States . Abbott doesn ’ t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals . The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw . The Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement it services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings . Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US . “ The federal government ’ s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation , ” the governor said in a statement . “ The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations . Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism , President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S. ” “ While many refugees pose no danger , some pose grave danger , like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston , ” Abbott said . “ Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas , the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless , and Texas will not be an accomplice to such delinquency of duty to the American people , ” he added . “ Therefore , Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program . I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives. ” So take THAT Mr. President !",1

"An independent examiner has determined that Tyre King , the 13 year-old African-American boy fatally shot by Columbus , OH police last Wednesday , was “ more likely than not ” running away from an officer at the time he was shot . The conclusion would seem to contradict the official police narrative , which holds that King was shot in a confrontation with officers after “ he pulled a realistic-looking BB gun on them ” . King was shot at 7:42 pm last Wednesday after officers responded to reports of an armed robbery over $ 10 by a group of three African-American teenagers . According to the official police department report , “ officers followed the males to an alley and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband . One officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times. ” The Columbus coroner ’ s office has completed an autopsy of King ’ s body but the results won ’ t be made public for at least six weeks . It was this delay that prompted King ’ s family to hire an independent medical examiner , Dr. Francisco Diaz , who is a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan and works as a medical examiner for Wayne County , MI . In a statement released by the King family ’ s attorney today , Diaz said that “ based on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds. ” It is not in question that King was involved in the robbery ; indeed his friend Demetrius Braxton , 19 , who was with King that night and has since been arrested , said that King “ wanted to rob somebody for money. ” Diaz ’ s report , however , confirms the suspicions of many in the community and across the country that the use of lethal force by responding officers was unnecessary and that a story of King aiming his gun at the police had been concocted as a justification . Indeed Braxton ’ s account of the encounter , have before the results of Diaz ’ s investigation were reported , similarly contradicts the official narrative . He told the local newspaper that “ the cops said ‘ get down ’ and We got down , but my friend [ King ] got up and ran … [ and ] when he ran , the cop shot him. ” The last time we checked , petty thievery does not carry the death sentence in the United States of America . While many will be inclined to somehow argue that the boy deserves it for committing a robbery , consider this . When young white men are convicted of rape in America , like Brock Turner , judges let them walk because they think they deserve a second chance . When young African-Americans commit crimes , they are smeared as career criminals and executed on the espy . The King case is only the most recent in a long string of deadly encounters between young African-American men and the police , many of which have been muddled by the victims ’ having been carrying BB guns made to look like unquestionable firearms . Given the ubiquity not only of BB guns but of actual firearms as well amongst white Americans the implication – and sometimes overt justification – by police that the mere presence of what looks like a weapon on a young African-American boy constitutes a deadly threat is questionable at best . The injustice of such encounters becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police , a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer . And what is most insidious about these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police to lie , as they seem to have done in King ’ s case by claiming that he was pointing his weapon at officers when he was shot . Far more than the peaceful protests of Black Lives Matter , it is these fabricated standoffs between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “ war on police. ” Through their attorney , King ’ s family have asked that the public “ continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted. ” They have also called for an independent investigation into their son ’ s killing , saying that “ The Columbus police department , the City of Columbus and most importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation . ”",1
"According to Charlotte Police , about 70 % of protesters in the area are not only out-of-staters , but are “ criminals. ” “ This is not Charlotte that ’ s out here , ” a spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police said . “ These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems . These are not protestors , these are criminals. ” “ I ’ m not saying all the people , but we ’ ve got the instigant that are coming in from the outside . They were coming in on buses from out of state . If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night . I can say probably about 70 % of those make out-of-state IDs . They ’ re not coming from Charlotte. ” In fact , according to police , these troublemakers were bused in from out of state just to wreak havoc on the city .

While that is something that might be worthy of discussion – definitely not worth looting a Walmart over – what ’ s interesting is that the cop who shot Keith Scott was a black man himself .

"Germany ’ s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible , adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants . This quickly turned into a horror show , as crime was unleashed onto German cities , with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year . The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany , because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel ’ s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin . Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could , citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided , and that she regrets the mistake she made , also referring to multiculturalism as a “ living lie. ” According to the Daily Mail , Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference , she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis , ‘ we can do this ’ , but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx . ‘ A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society , even in a country like Germany , ’ she said . The leader , once known as the ‘ Iron Chancellor ’ , won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face . However , she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals . ‘ We want to , and we will , noticeably reduce the number of refugees , ’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe . ‘ With an approach focused on the German , European and global level , we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration. ’ Mrs Merkel attempted to defend her August decision , which drew hundreds of thousands to Europe , claiming it was a ‘ humanitarian imperative ’ . She appealed to the party ’ s sense of history , saying that the same forte that allowed it ‘ to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle , and to go from division to a reunified country ’ would aim Germany through the crisis . She said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers , urging bolstered protection for the bloc ’ s external borders , support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution dodge among EU member states . She also touted a range of measures already undertaken in Germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants . Mrs Merkel , who has been the country ’ s leader for a decade , tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘ sick man of Europe ’ and ‘ should be a country that is open , curious , tolerant and even exciting ’ . It ’ s nice that she recognizes this , but it ’ s too little , too late . It came as no surprise to anyone voting Trump , but then again , it ’ s getting tiring to say “ I told you so ” so many times to so many different people . Hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country , so there ’ s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election . We have to stop her in November by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences . ( Source : Daily Mail )",1

"It ’ s happy times for ISIS and Caliphate supporters everywhere as they deliriously report and applaud the allegedly terrorist bomb that exploded in New York and the ISIS inspired knife attacker in a Minnesota mall . After the bomb went off , social media blew up with proud jihadist sympathizers scoring one for their team . Some of the comments on social media were as follows ; “ The lions of the Caliphate roar in New York , we cause you pain inside your house , the carrier of the Cross , ” wrote one Twitter user who went by the name “ I am ISIS , come and block name ” The account was soon suspended . Another , called “ The Lone Wolves , ” tweeted with the Arabic hashtag # ExplosionManhattanNewYork “ Oh God burn America , take revenge in day me. of your oppressed slaves and believers ’ blood. ” Others tweeted about “ good tidings that keep coming ” from New York , and one user affiliated with al-Qaeda in Syria tweeted : “ Oh God go against America , the head of infidels . Oh God , count them and kill them one by one , and do not spare anyone of them. ” Evil walks this earth . It ’ s name is radical Islamic terrorism . It celebrates when the blood of infidels ( meaning regular people who do not agree with radical Islam ) is spilled . It laughs with glee when New York is terrorized . It mocks westerners , Americans , Christians and Jews . It cares nothing for pain , suffering and outrage . It wishes and works for the the that Islam dominates the earth . That evil prowls social media taking credit for and celebrating bloodshed . And this newest event is no exception . There is joy among jihadists as New Yorkers and Minnesotans lie in their own blood . They need to be stopped . But who will do it ? See video of explosion below .",1

"The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as Mitch McConnell and other Republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of Flint , MI . Senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until December 9 at the least . Absent such an agreement , the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on October 1 . The intransigence of Senate Republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to Flint , however , have prevented the bill from passing as the Senate shot down a GOP continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote . The first sticking point is a rider that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the Securities and Exchange Committee ( SEC ) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending . Ever since the Citizens United decision of 2010 , corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending upward to the evolution public . This has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in American elections – close to $ 700 million so far this year – and has served Republicans and their big-money donors quite well . So well , in fact , that Senate Republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings . Clashes have also arisen over Republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of Flint , MI , which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis . The bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in Maryland , West Virginia , and Louisiana , and Democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in Flint be included as well . Republicans , however , have refused to add this money , and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor African-Americans , from claiming that the Flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the Flint aid should be included in the separate Water Resources Development Act ( WRDA ) instead . The problem with that excuse is that Democrats have already tried to pass the Flint aid through WRDA but came up against the same wall of Republican intransigence and indifference there . The Senate successfully passed a version of the WRDA earlier this year that included more than $ 220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for Flint . Paul Ryan and his band of extremist Republicans in the House , however , stripped the Flint aid provision from the House version of the WRDA , and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the November election , and the dominance of hardline Republicans in the House makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to Flint . So , once again , Republicans , for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts , are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason . The issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence , however , demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many Republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors . If the health and livelihood of this nation ’ s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process , these Republicans won ’ t bat an eye .",1
"The only convincing reason I can see for raising taxes is that it ’ ll mean less money in the pockets of George Soros . While liberals bemoan money in politics , it ’ s often those liberals funded by the likes of Soros doing the complaining . As of 2016 , his net worth is nearly $ 25 billion . The right-wing Koch Brothers ( worth 42.5 billion apiece ) are wealthier , but Soros “ invests ” much more in politics than Soros at . Soros started the Open Society Institute in 1993 as a way to redistribute his wealth to progressive causes . Using Open Society as a conduit , Soros has given more than $ 10 billion to a who ’ s who of left-wing groups . Imagine how the hungry people worldwide that much money could ’ ve saved , but instead he put that money towards organizations bent on destroying our civil society . This partial list of recipients of Soros ’ money says it all : ACORN , Apollo Alliance , National Council of La Raza , Tides Foundation , Huffington Post , Southern Poverty Law Center , Soujourners , People for the American Way , Planned Parenthood , and the National Organization for Women . On the bright side , at least it ’ s his money he ’ s wasting going towards these causes , not federal money . At eighty-six years of age , the man is nearing many end of his life , and throwing money to whoever will take it does this point . He ’ s heavily backed Black Lives Matter , and now , is putting his money where his mouth is on the refugee issue . As Weasel Zippers reports : Billionaire George Soros said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he would invest $ 500 million to meet the needs of migrants . The White House announced the commitment from Soros and around 50 other companies ahead of Obama convening a refugee summit Tuesday afternoon . Soros also said that he plans to work more closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to assist in his investments . ‘ In response , I have decided to earmark $ 500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants , refugees and host communities . I will invest in startups , established companies , social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves . Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe , I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world. ’ ‘ Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees. ’ The lifetime cost of admitting only the 10,000 refugees we admitted in America comes out to a large $ 6.5 billion . George Soros isn ’ t going to be getting much bang for his buck ( especially when its ten times cheaper to resettle refugees in the Middle East than in America and Europe ) but if he wants to waste his money , I ’ m all for that . I ’ d rather him not have it anyway .",1
"Police were called to a New Jersey elementary school after a 9-year-old student said , '' Brownies , '' while talking about snacks , his mother alleged . Another student reportedly misinterpreted the comment and thought it was said in a racist way , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer . A teacher subsequently called police . “ He said they were talking about brownies , ” Stacy dos Santos , the child ’ s mother , said . `` Who exactly did he offend ? '' Dos Santos added that the incident has made her think twice about sending her child back to the school in the fall . “ I ’ m not comfortable with the administration ; I don ’ t trust them , and neither does my child , ” she said . “ helium was intimidated , obviously . There was a police officer with a gun in the holster talking to my son , saying , ‘ Tell me what you said. ’ He didn ’ t have anybody on his side. ” Officers also spoke to the shaver ’ s parents , and the incident was reported to the New Jersey section of Child Protection and Permanency . Collingswood Police Chief Kevin Carey stated during a meeting with school officials that they should report incidents to police , including cases “ as minor as a simple name-calling incident that the school would typically handle internally. ” Police also said they were advised to refer almost every case to Child Protection and Permanency . This policy was a shift from the previous one under the Memorandum of Agreement between the police and schools in New Jersey , under which incidents were reported only when deemed serious enough . Such action was typically taken in cases involving drugs , weapons or sexual assault . Since the meeting , officers have been called to the school as often as five times per day . “ Some of it is just typical little-kid behavior , ” teacher Megan Irwin said . “ Never before in my years of teaching have I felt uncomfortable handling a situation or felt like I didn ’ t know how to handle a situation. ” The mayor , police and Camden County Prosecutor ’ s Office ultimately arranged a meeting to discuss incidents . “ In our discussion today , you and your staff made it abundantly clear that our recent meeting was to reinforce the applicability of the Memorandum of Agreement , but not to expand its terms , ” Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley wrote in a letter to the prosecutor ’ s office , the Collingswod Patch reported .

"This video is crazy ! While I disagree with the ‘ science ’ of it , it nonetheless reveals how violent Black Lives Matter is . Before I show you the video I want you to understand that Black Lives Matter movement has much less to do with black people than a movement to completely destroy America and change it into something it ’ s not . Black Lives Matter released the platform demanding that ALL police departments be de-funded , race-based reparations for something that happened hundreds of years ago that has zero to do with any living person now , voting rights should be given illegal immigrants ( unheard of anywhere else in the world ) , an end to private education and charter schools ( as if the educational system didn ’ t suck enough in this country but they trust in the ‘ system ’ of public schools just not cops , a “ universal basic income , ” which is already provided to millions of Americans called welfare and free college for blacks ( not anyone else ’ s responsibility to pay for this but you ) . So basically a guy stands on the sidewalk with a Black Lives Matter sign and not much happens . THEN he stands on the sidewalk with an All Lives affair sign and all havoc breaks loose . People start behaving as if he own just said the worst insult about their mother . One guy even yelled “ all lives don ’ t matter , only black lives matter ” . That ’ s a pretty scary prospect when you have groups of people who start believing lives don ’ t matter . After I watched the video I read the comments and commented on a few . My jaw is hitting the floor reading how uneducated some of the commenters were… one of them believes America has had slavery for 600 years . I suggested he try simple math 2016-1492= NOT 600 . Then someone mentioned that whites invented racism and I had to point out who sold blacks into slavery from africa to the British . Check out the video… based on the videos of Black Lives Matter riots the past 2 years I am not surprised :",1
"Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile appeared on MSNBC ’ s “ AM Joy ” on Sunday and discussed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’ s collapse on Sept. 11 . What was intended to be a compliment turned out to be a major admission about the severity of Clinton ’ s health that day . “ Although she had to be lifted into that van , you know what ? She got up , like most of us , she got up and she kept fighting , so that ’ s the Hillary Clinton that I hope people get to know , ” Brazile said , Breitbart reported . This is the first time someone from Team Clinton has admitted that the former secretary of state had to be lifted into the van , and that ’ s big news because it means Clinton was not in control of her body . Talk about bad news getting worse . Brazile thought she was giving Clinton a compliment , but she slipped up and essentially made things worse for Clinton by admitting the former first lady had to be lifted into the van . The question that will be on the minds of many people is exactly when Hillary got up along her own and what was needed for her to do so . While Clinton has admitted to being diagnosed with pneumonia , that doesn ’ t get rid of her other chronic condition — lying to the public . She said she didn ’ t tell the public about her diagnosis because she didn ’ t think it was a big deal , but if she pay just a little bit of attention to the news , she would have known the her health is a huge concern — peerless she should not be ignoring . Clinton ’ s episode on Sept. 11 was serious , and many people across the globe saw it — including world leaders who could view her condition — whatever it is — as a weakness , and attempt to take advantage of it .

"The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats , insulted at having been dragged into this show trial , took the opportunity to instead flip the script . During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen ’ s hearing , Democrats began ignoring the “ impeachment ” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump ’ s numerous tax scandals , including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud . Of particular interest was Trump ’ s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit . Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense . An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election . The head of the IRS – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed . “ Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns , if they want to , because they ’ re under audit ? ” Rep. Jerry Nadler , a Democrat from New York asked . “ No , ” Koskinen responded simply . Another Democratic representative asked it another way . “ Would releasing the person ’ s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return ? ” Rep. Ted Deutch asked . “ The release itself wouldn ’ t . The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will occlusion be discovered or provided , ” Koskinen said . In other words , Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad , or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time . This answer actually confirms what Trump ’ s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad . It wasn ’ t the audit that scares Trump , it ’ s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what ’ s in them and that would destroy his father ’ s chances of becoming president . It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election . It won ’ t matter then . The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “ What have we done ? ” expressions painted on their faces . Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose , such as his actual income , what he pays the government in taxes , clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving . Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D-Calif. ) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival . Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia , to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses . “ Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations ? ” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( D-Texas ) . The answer was no . Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles ( a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr. ’ s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy ) . He later clarified that , unlike some people , he wouldn ’ t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one . It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker . The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups . The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn ’ t seem to bother them . The impeachment hearing , widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show , came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP newsperson with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become . They settled for grandstanding . So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone ’ s time , Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is . Waste not , want not . Watch the IRS hearing , starting with Rep. Nadler ’ s investigation into Trump ’ s lies , here : Featured image via YouTube Billionaire Nick Hanauer says things need to change , but not the way we expect .",1
"I can ’ t wait for “ Weekend at Chelsea ’ s ” to hit the big screen . CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton ’ s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script . If this woman , God forbid , dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow , these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has , understandably , reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “ minor setback ” to her “ inevitable ” victory . The American people aren ’ t buying it . This is a severely ill woman . No more “ conspiracy theory ” dismissals . Mrs. Clinton ’ s “ mild cold , ” er , “ seasonal allergies , ” I mean “ heat exhaustion , ” that is to say “ minor case of pneumonia ” is , evidently , of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “ mystery man ” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “ episodes ” ( or otherwise freezes up with a brain “ short-circuit ” during a speech ) . This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot ( also covered up ) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen . Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures . Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures . These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers ( since when has “ pneumonia ” required a neurological squeeze test ? ) . The Clinton campaign needs to come clean . They won ’ t , but they should . I wonder what official “ diagnosis ” we ’ ll get of next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they ’ ve been there a hundred times before . “ Nothing to see here , folks . Secretary Clinton ’ s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘ powered through ’ yesterday going door-to-door. ” The point is that , once more , by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced ( and justified ) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president . She ’ s proven , yet again , that she can ’ t be trusted . She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters , as revealed by her historically low approval ratings , have formed relative to her health and character . She ’ s a liar . That ’ s her default mode . She ’ s corrupt . And she ’ s sick . Very sick . She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation , and even her own life . Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton ’ s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers ? Well , no on the first , yes on the second . “ Do not gloat when your enemy falls ; when they stumble , do not let your heart rejoice ” ( Proverbs 24:17 ) . Indeed , Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week , but her poll numbers were already trending downward . Her medical crisis over the weekend , coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump ’ s supporters as a “ racist ” and “ irredeemable ” “ basket of deplorables , ” has only served to accelerate the plunge . Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman . This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd , D-W.Va. , her “ friend and mentor. ” Sen. Byrd , of course , was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK . This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband , former president Bill Clinton , was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans , not unlike those she just slandered , worked hard to pass it . Finally , and going back a bit further , this is the same Hillary Clinton harpies party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them . Who ’ s the racist ? I ’ m praying for Hillary Clinton . Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling , and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie , our eyes have been telling us the truth for months , maybe even years now . To watch this increasingly frail , bitter and elderly woman stiffen up , convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach . You can ’ t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her , wicked though she may be . It ’ s almost tragic to witness . Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment . Everything she ’ s ever done or said , and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she ’ s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime , has been designed to place her in the Oval Office , not as first lady , but as president of the United States . Proverbs 19:21 says , “ Many are the plans in a person ’ s heart , but it is the LORD ’ s purpose that prevails. ” Am I saying there ’ s no chance Hillary Clinton will win ? Not at all , though I think it unlikely . Between her devoted media whose , her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up , there ’ s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory . Still , it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton ’ s political aspirations . Even so , I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee . When they visit her in prison .

"This actually happened in June , but is just as pertinent today , especially with 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the US next weekend . Police in New Mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle . The drive was an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East… that ’ s bad enough , but what is even worse is what she had in her car . The woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her . This just screams ‘ terrorism ’ . I have no idea why they pulled her over , but it was a very good thing they did . It has been widely reported that hundreds , if not thousands , of Islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border . Judicial Watch released a report last summer saying that Mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country . They furthermore released a second report just axerophthol few months ago saying that Islamic terror groups residing in Mexico have begun traveling to America in order to seek out potential targets . That border has now become a literal ticking time bomb of terrorism . It ’ s not ‘ if ’ , it ’ s ‘ when ’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of Barack Obama and the Marxists who are for open borders . They want America to be like Europe… Europe which is toast because of the Hijrah Migration and terrorism . No thanks . From Mad World News : Police in New Mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented , Middle Eastern woman . However , the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert . Judicial Watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in Luna County , New Mexico pulled over an unidentified “ Islamic refugee ” for an undisclosed reason . Luckily for everyone involved , the minor traffic infraction turned into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession . The pipeline is in Deming , New Mexico , and U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’ s ( fbi ) Joint Terrorism Task Forces ( JTTF ) have been sent to the area to investigate . Unfortunately , the find could only be declarative of what is to come . Obama could bring in up to 250,000 Islamic refugees this next year . He is seeding them across America in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the US into an Islamic nation . Bringing in unvetted Islamists guarantees ISIS terrorists in their midst and Obama is good with that . What ’ s a few dead infidels to him ? The plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of Deming about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces . Thanks to high unemployment , poverty , crime and a horrible public education system , Deming has been named No . 1 on a list of the “ ten worst places ” to live in New Mexico . The entire region is considered a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area due to large amounts of meth , heroin , cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers . The brutal Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in that area . The media has swept this under the rug , but it is a severe national security threat . This election may pivot on it , especially if we get hit . Our leaders owe it to their constituents to put our safety first , lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants . Before we lose countless Americans to terrorism that is .",1
"Tonight 's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is must-see TV , and many celebrities will be watching from home , as well as from the front row . Billionaire entrepreneur and `` Shark Tank '' co-star Mark Cuban has confirmed that he will be taking a front-row seat at the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York to cheer on Team Hillary . Just got a front row seat to watch @ HillaryClinton overwhelm @ realDonaldTrump at the `` Humbling at Hofstra '' on Monday . It Is On ! `` Obviously , I 'm a not a Trump fan . I am a Clinton fan , '' Cuban told ABC News today at the red carpet season premiere of `` Shark Tank . '' `` I think she 'd make a great president . `` I do n't think he 's got the skill set , '' he said about Trump . `` Let 's put it this way , if he came on 'Shark Tank , ' I would n't make the investment . I just do n't see him as being capable in the least bit . '' Trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers , the variety show performer who famously had an affair with Bill Clinton before he became president . If dopey Mark birth Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row , perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him ! Although Trump 's campaign manager told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos that Trump did not actually invite Flowers , it seems she was willing to accept the invitation . Hi Donald . You know I 'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate ! ... ? ? Meanwhile , other celebrities are gearing up to watch the first debate between the two candidates . Here 's what they are saying on social media : Ready for # mudslingmonday # YOUGOTTHISHRC pic.twitter.com/0lbXPnUKDD May angels stand guard at the debate tonight .

Why would they schedule a debate on a Monday Night Football Night ? ? Guess it makes sense to somebody . For the debates on Monday , I 'm thinking of serving skewers . With Cheetos and skittles for munchies , of course . To level the field at the debates tonight , Hillary Clinton will be administered anesthesia , and all questions will be read to her in German . Can not wait to watch the Trump - Clinton debate , this Monday .. I 'm betting that the shorter of the two blonds will prevail .. Only 50 more days til we find out who 's our next President ! Last time I was nauseous 50 days straight , at least I got a baby out of it !",1
"Republicans have been crossing party lines to announce their votes for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this year ’ s general election in numbers not seen in decades . Now , Politico reports that the highest level defection yet comes from former President George H. W. Bush , who revealed to a Kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of notwithstanding the Democratic party ’ s candidate Hillary Clinton : Bush , 92 , had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump , a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee . But his preference for the wife of his own successor , President Bill Clinton , nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend , the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy . The Republican Party ’ s embrace of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins and learned Spanish . It ’ s no surprise that the eldest Bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for Hillary Clinton . Both of Texas ’ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas , who are both deeply conservative news organizations , endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this year ’ s presidential debates , which kick off next week . It must be reassuring to the elder statesman ’ s rare crossing of party lines , knowing that he can trust the depth of Hillary Clinton ’ s national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any party ’ s nominee in possibly mustiness all of our nation ’ s history . Former President George H.W . Bush won ’ t be the last prominent Republican to declare for Hillary Clinton in this year ’ s General Election , but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect .",1
"For decades , employers card been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want . Of course , what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway . Jobs get outsourced , wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced . It âWith been since , well , the last presidential election , though , that weâve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side ( Republican ) loses . Four years ago , it was âPapaâ John Schnatter , who threatened to cut his employeesâ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through . It did and he didnât . This year , another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnât get his way . Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carlâs Jr. and Hardeeâs . Hereâs one of his commercials , which may not be safe for work : Judging by the commercials , like Donald Trump , Puzder likely cares little about political correctness . But thatâs not the reason he wants a Republican in office . He just doesnât want to pay people more , or at all . In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal , Puzder says that if a Democrat wins , either Democrat , he will fully automate his stores . Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa , Puzder wrote : âI want to try it , â CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans . âWe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa , where you order on a kiosk , you pay with a credit or debit have , your order pops up , and you never see a person.â hasnât government driving up the cost of labor , itâs driving down the number of jobs , â he says . âYouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores , but in restaurants.â âThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders , and Hillary Clinton , and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage , â says Puzder . âDoes it really help if Sally makes $ 3 more an hour if Suzie has no job ? â Source : Yahoo Finance This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees . Across the country , Puzder has about 20,000 employees . Heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests . Puzder also has his own blog , where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism . One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is . Puzder is doing just fine . In 2012 , it was reported that he made nearly $ 4.5 million . His profits have been up in recent years , but his employees donât see any of that . In fact , Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied . You can guarantee , though , that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same , Puzder will still be automating . Thatâs just the way he is : profits over people .",1
"As if Donald Trump ’ s plan to ban Muslim immigration didn ’ t infuriate liberals enough , his plan to stop the Islamization of America has another component . Trump also expressed interest in deporting any Muslims who express support for Sharia law . In a bad turn of events for liberals , some actually attempted to hilariously defend Sharia in response to the latter . CNN commenter Sally Kohn took to Twitter , writing “ Hey Donald Trump , many progressive Muslims — the ones we should support in ideaological fight against extremism — believe in Sharia ! ! ” By the way , Kohn is a lesbian , and would be put to death under Sharia law . There ’ s no disagreement among scholars of Islamic law that death is the punishment for homosexuality – the debate is over how they should be killed . If that ’ s “ progressive , ” we have even more reasons to despite progressivism . I ’ m also sure most people aren ’ t on board with beheadings for apostasy , and cutting off the limbs of thieves . Now , as Dennis Michael Lynch reports , it ’ s clear what type of law ( Sharia vs. American Law ) many Muslims in America actually prefer . Fox News went to interview the Somalian Muslims on the streets of Cedar Riverside to learn the truth about how they really feel about living in America and American law . Every single one of them interviewed in the following video said they prefer Sharia law over American law . “ If you ’ re a Muslim , of course you want Sharia law , ” they say . They believe it ’ s ok to kill someone if they insult Mohammad . They believe it ’ s perfectly normal to force their daughter to marry someone when she reaches the age of 15 . When asked if they would prefer sulfur to live in America or Somalia , they say they would prefer Somalia . And the most stunning revelation of all is a young man at the end of the interview who admits , “ I ’ m not Americanized , I just speak fluent and I an articulate what I ’ m trying to say , but as far as my culture and my preferences , I ’ m still Somalian. ” Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com Fox News also featured another interview on the Cedar Riverside streets in May , where it was stated that they have at least two Islamic schools that teach Sharia law : Scary . These results are consistent with a poll of American Muslims conducted by the Center for Security Policy last year . It found that More than half ( 51 % ) of really U.S. Muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of American or shariah courts , or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah . Only 39 % of those polled said that Muslims in the U.S. should be subject to American courts . America is a tolerant nation – but that doesn ’ t mean we should tolerate the intolerance of Sharia .",1
"As this bizarre election cycle heads the home stretch , the issue of race relations in America has all-consuming . Add the shootings of two black men in Tulsa Charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder remarkably short . As the contends that systemic institutional is alive and well in this country , the right fires back with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther Jr. to prove that it ’ not . While liberals of unarmed black men as evidence of the and oppression inherent in system , conservatives off not as men being killed but rather as “ getting what for “ non-compliance. ” One favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all Americans under and instead convict them with their past records . that institutional racism extends police departments and systems , making young black men more arrest and conviction , we know about of driving a license , resisting arrest and jaywalking ever by every black man shot killed police . Today , while looking through a Twitter feed at a Fox News report about Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby being with for a man with hands in the air , I came across a shows that racism is without alive well in : @ foxandfriends blp3pic.twitter.com/JmjD5DNCRA — Theresa ( @ VOTE_TRUMP_ ) 23 , 2016 Once again , conservatives feel need to point out that the police officer who killed a shouldn ’ t be held accountable because he a very , very bad person There ’ s only one problem here : the tweeted information is the man killed in Charlotte , not Crutcher , killed officer in question .

"The wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband . You don ’ t actually see them shoot him , you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them . She kept saying he didn ’ t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had . Gee , did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun ? Regardless of her claiming he didn ’ t have one , you can plainly hear the officers telling him to put the gun down repeatedly . He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in . The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn . That is when they shot him . You can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something . He evidently did it and it involved the gun , which got him a dirt nap . I ’ m sorry , I have no sympathy for any of this . He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot . From Western Journalism : The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday , according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott ’ s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times . Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg , N.C. , police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers . Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott ’ s fingerprints and DNA . The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg . Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott . I don ’ t understand his wife either . There ’ s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point . And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it . He ’ s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for . The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims . Typical . Scott ’ s family , initially contended that he was carrying a book , but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “ impossible to discern ” what , if anything , he was carrying . They urged police to release the footage . “ There ’ s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively , threatening or maybe dangerous , ” said Justin Bamberg , one of the lawyers representing the family , said in an interview early on Friday . Well , you can ’ t see anything in the damned video , so I guess that is right . But you astatine can hear the police telling him to drop the gun again and again . Despite law enforcement ’ s refusal to release any footage , Scott ’ s family gave a video recorded by his wife to NBC News . It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities ’ press conference ended . That was totally staged . I ’ ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter . The police can ’ t articulate win for losing here .",1

Duplin County Schools announced on Monday they would be closing astatine noon Tuesday in anticipation of Trump ’ s visit . High amounts of traffic are expected in the area , schoolhouse officials said . Meanwhile , Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed .

"Hillary the compliant media are doing everything they to Trump ’ surge in and keep propped up ( literally . There to some movement among toward Trump . A or ten shift in the black vote toward Trump would be significant . When things to go south for Democrats , they play the race card . Claiming that President Obama might not have been born in the United States is a “ card ” issue . Trump raised it in 2011 . This forced Hawaiian authorities to release a copy of Obama ’ s birth certificate it not a copy of the original It ’ obvious from the historical record that Trump did originate the birther issue . It was around before he took the quest for the truth . From what we know , and the media not reporting , the birther subject spawned in of the Clinton campaign Hillary promote it ? Probably not . It was done by surrogates so she claim plausible . “ me ? ” had and has her “ buffers ” like all crime families do The following scene from the Godfather II Senate hearing : Here some of what we know : “ Ben and Byron Tau ] detailed in lengthy four-page-long investigation April 2008 , when Clinton was slipping in her battle against Obama for the for the , ‘ Clinton ’ —as say—circulated an anonymous email pushed theory . “ ‘ Barack ’ s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy . She was allowed to travel by plane then , so Barack Obama was born there his then took Hawaii to register his birth , ’ the that Clinton supporters circulated read. ” Those anonymous were hardly ones . In fact as Joshua Green reported in The Atlantic in August 2008 , a 19 , 2007 memo from longtime adviser Mark Penn proves that Clinton campaign itself was the conspiracy theory . Penn the memo , advocated Obama ’ s ‘ lack of American roots. ’ ( Breitbart Read : “ Clinton and the True History of ‘ Birtherism. ’ ” suggest that you read the entire article to see ’ s presidential knee-deep in the suggestion that Obama was not in and “ lack of American roots. ” [ ] But birther issue goes back to 1991 . Farah of asks , “ Who Was the First ‘ ’ ? ” “ Trump was hardly the first ‘ birther. ’ Neither was I Nor was my colleague Jerome . And neither was . “ That honor belongs to one and one person alone – Barack Obama. ” How this possible ? “ Obama went to extreme to conceal his past . , indeed he was born in the U.S. and , he certainly did to the mystery that led question being asked . “ Years earlier billed himself as having in Kenya “ he thought it was a way to sell , get a foreign student scholarship , attract women knows ? “ But it ’ s that boasted about it.

It comes from short bio was “ used Barack Obama s literary agency beginning in 1991 ending in – the year he declared his candidacy for president. ” s the sentence of the paragraph ( Breitbart ) : “ Barack , the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review , was born in and raised in Indonesia and ” Even Snopes it ’ true The editor of the short biography states it “ was a simple mistake and nothing more ” to say that Obama was born in Kenya . I ’ ll take him at word I can ’ t take him his word given what two images below show . It a fact that was a from client list Acton & Dystel published in 1991 ” that states Obama was born Kenya remained unquestioned until Obama himself had 16 years to disavow the information and call for a correction It would have been unusual for literary not to send a copy of the bio to Obama for approval .

"Months ago , former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheâd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican handler this election . For the most part , former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W . Bush have enjoin optedÂ to stay out of this election â until now . Word of George H.W . Bushâs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke , and itâs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party , but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead . Itâs a controversial decision , but obviously Bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country . The Trump campaign , as you can imagine , isnât taking this lightly . In an interview with CNNâs Erin Burnett , Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it . Conway said that although she ârespectsâ Bushâs choice , itâs ironic that heâs voting forÂ âthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992 . Conway alsoÂ chalked up Bushâs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to Trump in the primaries . She said : âThis was a bruising primary , and Jeb Bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â You can watch the interview below : âJeb Bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @ KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting # Clinton https : //t.co/iyhiLRgrPL â OutFrontCNN ( @ OutFrontCNN ) September 20 , 2016 This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be . The Bush familyÂ is making a responsible , informed decision during this election , and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around . This election is no joke â itâs about far more than Republican and Democrat parties .

"New Jersey ’ s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival . Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “ Bridgegate ” scandal by a judge , as WNYC reports : The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead , the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment . If it passes the Democrat-controlled body , the trial would be in the Senate , where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict . Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate , they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict . Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential ’ s nominee Donald Trump ’ s transition team chairperson . Just four days ago , federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor , accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City , which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world ’ s busiest bridges . Governor Christie was Trump ’ s most authoritative surrogate , as and as the first major “ conservative ” Republican endorser , in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump ’ s benefaction . Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor have Famously , Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference , which you can see below in its painstaking detail . It ’ s . cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor ’ s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th , 2014 , just two short months after his re-election , and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services . BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town . Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides , and stood by , well did nothing , though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages . The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration ’ s bare knuckle political bullying . We will watch this story closely , and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing , because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year ’ s Republican Presidential campaign . Watch his shame :",1
"Warning , Muslims , if you want to chant “ Allah ” over and over on a plane , there might be repercussions ! Faisal Ali and his wife , Nazia had boarded a Cincinnati bound Delta Air Lines flight in Paris , France . The plane sat on the tarmac for about 45 minutes . During that time , several flight attendants noticed that the husband was sweating , hiding his phone , and that both he and his wife were chanting “ Allah ” repeatedly . It made the flight attendants uncomfortable , reports the Independent UK . One of the flight crew ( after having cleared it with the captain ) approached the couple , and told them to gather their belongings as they would have to exit the plane over “ safety ” concerns . Faisal ’ s wife , Nazia , can be consider in this cell phone video becoming combative , asking if it ’ s about “ discrimination. ” A person who appears to be the captain tells Nazia that it ’ s a “ safety of flight issue. ” Mad World News reports that , When the Alis exited , a French police officer was waiting for them outside the gate and an airline worker was carefully reviewing their passports . The couple went through a brief interrogation process and they were okayed for release . It was then that the Delta employee explained that the pilot had made the decision to kick them off the flight because crew members noticed their particularly strange behavior and felt “ uncomfortable. ” The couple was promptly booked on another flight and sent home and has now offered them angstrom refund as a gesture of good will . Of course , this wasn ’ t enough to satisfy their entitlement . The inconvenience caused by their unconventional behavior was seen by them as being nothing less than a case of “ Islamophobia. ” So , the couple immediately called the terror-tied , Saudi-funded Council on American-Islamic Relations to whine about their alleged persecution . CAIR is accusing the airline of repeated profiling of Muslim passengers , and , if this is true , Delta is probably one of the safest airlines to fly . Because France is suffering from a constant barrage of Islamic terrorist attacks , they are taking measures to prevent Muslims from killing their citizens . Personally , I applaud the flight attendants and the captain . Muslims can scream “ Discrimination ! ” all they want . If you ’ re acting suspicious , you Will be removed from a flight , especially with all of the terror attacks that have been happening as of late . The flight crew was acting out of fear for their , and their passenger ’ s safety . Imagine if the couple Were terrorists . They could ’ ve taken the plane down , killing hundreds on board . Safety first , as they say . The hell with your feelings about being “ discriminated ” against . People want to LIVE , and not be attacked by terrorist trash . Did the flight crew make the right decision ? Share if you think they did ! By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter",1
"Animals behave better than this . After the shooting of a black man by a black police officer , things spiraled out of control in Charlotte , North Carolina . Last night was a lot more peaceful , but the two previous nights were hellish . One protester eventually died after another protester fired randomly into the crowd and shot him in the head . Almost a dozen police were hurt as were numerous protesters . Bricks , bottles , rocks , plants… whatever they could find , protesters threw at the police . The police in turn used tear gas , unreadable pepper spray and flash grenades . It was a war zone . All of this started when the suspect ’ s family starting spreading the false story that the man was unarmed and reading a book while he waited for his son to get home from school . No book was found , but a gun was . The man got out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster . He got back in the car and then got charlotte out again with the gun once more . An officer shot him after he repeatedly refused to drop the weapon . His family incited violence and rioting as did a Muslim man who represented them . They should be arrested . From The Federalist Papers Project : Robert Gehl reports that rioters in Charlotte in their second night in a row rampaging the city tried to throw a photographer into a bonfire they started in the middle of the street . Local station WCCB reported in a tweet Wednesday night that its reporters witnessed “ protesters ” trying to burn the photographer alive . The statement was repeated by Marvin Beach , a reporter for WCCB on their live stream . Beach said the station ’ s photographer witnessed the attack . As The Daily Caller reports , it ’ s unclear exactly why they tried to throw the photographer on the fire , or why it failed , but the livestream apparently later captured police providing assistance to the unnamed photographer , indicated he was unharmed . The photographer was apparently white , raising the specter that he was targeted because of his race – There have been many cases of race-oriented violence during the two-day chaos . The worst example of the barbaric behavior that occurred this week was when a white photographer was grabbed by Black Lives Matter goons who then tried to throw him into a fire and burn him alive . He was evidently unharmed , but that could have cost him his life . A statement by a reporter named Marvin Beach on WCCB ’ s livestream of the riots , said the station ’ s photographer witnessed the attack . It ’ s unclear why the effort failed , but WCCB ’ s livestream later captured police providing assistance to the photographer , indicating he was rescued without suffering grievous harm . What kind of monsters do something like this simply because of race ? They are doing everything they say they are protesting against . This will not end well if it keeps up . This is what you wanted , America.https : //t.co/fLTyk3IrT2 — Roark ( @ Roark__ ) September 22 , 2016",1

"Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican materialistic party . ( CNN ) Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter said undecided voters are different this election cycle because they 're `` absolutely clued in '' with who the candidates of both major parties are -- and they still do n't like what they see . `` Normally what you see in those groups , people who are undecided , they 're undecided because they really have n't been paid much attention , '' Walter told CNN 's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation . Walter , who also worked for former Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky , said undecided voters sounded like children trying to avoid hopping into a cold pool . GOP policy guru : Trump ca n't 'fake his way through 90 minutes ' `` Here , these undecided voters are absolutely clued-in and they 're like that feeling we all had in school when you had to jump into the cold pool in first hour P.E. , and you 're like , ' I do n't want to get in there , I do n't want to jump in there ! I know I 'm going to have to get in . ' So , they are undecided because they do n't want to make a choice , not because they do n't know about their choices , '' she said . Walter said for the first time that she can remember , she 's having trouble trusting the data that 's coming from the campaign trail , and that undecided voters are struggling to choose between the lesser of two evils . Voters say this is the ultimate 'lesser of two evils ' election `` What I hear from these groups , is just this idea of like 'You know , I do n't know if I trust Hillary Clinton , ' '' she said . `` One woman said , ' I do n't trust Hillary Clinton on terrorism ' -- to sort of get to your point of instability in the world -- 'but Donald Trump is going to get us into World War III .

"The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal , where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway , has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll . Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary ’ s top aides , including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination . Now the the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey ’ s fate . Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen , demanded that he lose his job . “ This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director ’ s fitness for office , ” DiGenova said . He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills ’ computer . “ The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to , FBI because Comey is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity , ” he said . “ This was not a real investigation . This was a ‘ protected investigation ’ designed to look like an investigation. ” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently , they listened . This week , Comey will have to answer for his behavior . Will Congress hold it responsible for this joke of an investigation ? He isn ’ t just having to face a hearing ; he ’ s been issued a subpoena from Congress , too . Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton ’ s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them . In a further attempt to get Comey to comply , Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents . How loyal is Comey to Hillary , really ? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her ? And if the answer to that question is “ yes , ” then the new question becomes… why ?",1

"The idea that I power have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill . I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency , but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election . What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama ’ s legacy ? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap ? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “ for the first time in my life I ’ m proud of my country. ” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “ # BringBackOurGirls ” sign . But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration ? * insert mechanical applause here * But what would her role be ? What is she even qualified to do ? It ’ s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children . If you doubt that , read this tweet : I mean , how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children ? For an additional wave of nausea , read Hillary go on and on about her “ faith ” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology . Of course , Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids , as reported by The Washington Post . Back in February , she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids , either . “ I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work , ” she said . “ I have a rest-of-my-life horizon. ” This reeks of desperation . Is Hillary trying to capture the “ I don ’ t like Hillary , but I do like the Obamas ” vote ? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of tinge at the helm , people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because , you know , racism or something . Either way , I ’ m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children . The administration is not one gigantic parental unit , nor should it be viewed as one . That is an extremely dangerous idea to have , as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen .",1
"President Obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror . go He assures us that ISIS is decimated and that we have little to fear indium from the looming presence of radical Islam throughout the world . He ’ s wrong . Not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical Islam , at best , our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of Islam . However , as weak as our response to ISIS has been , it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war . According to an Iraqi source , ISIS has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein . “ Special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 ISIS militants of those who slept in the hospitals of Nineveh , ” the Iraqi source said . “ What has been stolen from those members included the kidneys , intestines and more ; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city. ” The source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons , said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields . “ This came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding , particularly with regard to crude oil , which it provides about 80 % of the imports of the terrorist organization. ” It is gratifying to see that ISIS must tighten their belts . However , what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical Islam and so long as the Western world confuses idiocy with tolerance , it ’ s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix this problem .",1
"Hillary Clinton used the first presidential debate of the general-election season to launch a full frontal attack on Donald Trump , baiting him into fights over his personal finances , taxes , sexism , race relations , business dealings and personal honesty . If Clinton came looking for a fight , she found it . Her aggressive tone drew Trump in . He attacked Clinton right back , showing flashes of anger that channeled public frustration and also the coarser side of his public persona . It made for some lively exchanges , including several that brought an edge to Trump ’ s tone . “ She doesn ’ t have the look , ” Trump said toward the end of the debate . “ She doesn ’ t have the stamina. ” Trump appeared rattled at times , particularly as the debate wore on . Yet his main attacks on Clinton were rooted in policy grounds , as he sought to give voice to public anger not just at Clinton but at the broader political class . “ You ’ ve been doing this for 30 years — why are you just thinking about these solutions now ? ” Trump said in a section of the debate about ways to create jobs . “ I have thought about this quite a bit , ” Clinton countered . “ Yeah , for 30 years , ” Trump responded . Trump stretched facts and attacked Clinton ’ s temperament . He — for the most part — kept his cool . Throughout the debate , Clinton called Trump “ Donald. ” He almost always referred to her as “ Secretary Clinton ” and made sure that was all right with her . “ I want you to be very happy . It ’ s very important to me , ” Trump said , challenging the fact-checkers once again . Trump was brought onto his shakiest ground of the night when moderator Lester Holt convey up President Barack Obama ’ s birthplace — specifically why it took Trump until just weeks ago to declare the matter settled . Trump flatly said , “ I say nothing ” to those who wonder why he pushed the matter as long as he did . And he falsely accused Clinton of starting the birther question in 2007 , claiming credit for putting the issue to rest . “ Just like she can ’ t bring back jobs , she can ’ t produce ” Obama ’ s birth certificate , Trump said . Clinton pounced on an issue with resonance among black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition . “ It can ’ t be dismissed that easily . He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen , ” she said . “ The birther lie was a very hurtful one. ” Apparently worried that Trump would be on his best behavior , Clinton started her barrage early . She suggested that Trump ’ s success is inherited , and that he ’ s hiding his tax returns to avoid embarrassment . “ Maybe he ’ s not as rich as he says he is , ” she said . “ Maybe he ’ s not as charitable as he claims to be. ” Trump didn ’ t even bother to deny Clinton ’ s suggestion that he hasn ’ t paid income taxes “ for a lot of years , ” turning even that into an argument against the status quo . “ It would be squandered too , believe me , ” Trump said . Clinton also found a groove in attacking Trump on Iraq . Trump again insisted that he was against the Iraq War before it started , a statement for which there is no public record in support of his claim . For his part , Trump took Clinton on consistently , attacking her on jobs , trade and national security , using her as a stand-in for politicians in general . “ I have a feeling that by the end of this evening , I ’ m going to be blamed for everything that ever happened , ” Clinton said at one point . Trump : “ Why not ? ” Clinton : “ Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. ” Clinton had one of her better moments in declaring her fitness for office , keying off of Trump ’ s criticism of her for retreating from the campaign trail . “ Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate . And yes , I did , ” she said . “ And you know what else I prepared for ? I devise to be president . And I think that ’ s a good thing. ” Later in the debate , Trump allowed that Clinton has experience , “ but it ’ s bad experience , ” he said . “ This country ca n't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience , ” Trump said . After the first extraordinary encounter between two extraordinarily unpopular nominees , the plays are clear . Clinton is putting her experience up against the anger Trump is channeling , anger that has two distinct sides to it . They proved they can get under each other ’ s scrape . But neither candidate proved that he or she has a winning message , not on the night of the first debate .",1
"In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever , an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable ( or unwillingly ) to un-earth : Proof that Hillary Clinton conspired to cover up her “ un-wise ” use of a private server and email scandal . Through the power of social media , a Twitter user @ GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation . Paul Combetta , the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton than her time as Secretary of State , allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary ’ s name from classified emails . He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “ stonetear ” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more during a few definitive breadcrumbs . In his requests for help from the public at large , Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “ Unamed VIP Client ” from email servers and archives . “ Hello all , ” one of the posts begins . “ I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP ’ s ( VERY VIP ) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox , as well as a PST file . Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone . … Does anyone have experience with something like this , and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished ? ” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Clinton to save all relevant posts and data . Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish : proof of Hillary ’ s Reddit ’ s criminal activity . The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question : is the screen name “ stonetear ” definitively Combetta ? In not , the evidence is circumstantial . If so , the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up . To support the argument that “ stonetear ” is in fact Hillary Clinton ’ s IT specialist , @ GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections : This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them . As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee , the work of the American people , both as investigators like @ GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot , will not remain silent . `` How to delete an IT guy who uses Reddit and make it look like an accident '' # ThingsHillaryGooglespic.twitter.com/P41uwzYWAD @ realDonaldTrump — Boca Vista ( @ bocavista2016 ) September 21 , 2016",1
"The Weiner is back , yet again , in the news and if you thought he couldn ’ t get any more disgusting , well you would be stupid…I mean , come on . It ’ s Anthony “ Douche ” Weiner…I like the sound of that . Anyways , back in January , Anthony Weiner , 51 , who at the time wasn ’ t in the process of divorce with top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin , supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons . “ I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent , ” stated Weiner as he was interviewed on FoxNews Online . The details are this . Back in January of 2016 , Weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl . We know that he knew she was 15 because using the KIK , a popular social media app , he had asked the girl what high school she went to . Yeah , that kind of drains all doubt that he didn ’ t know she was underage . Let ’ s not forget , this man is married . So sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he ’ s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting heading evil this piece of turd is . Both the girl and Weiner sent sexually charged pictures and texts back and forth . Weiner also eventually ended up at the girl ’ s home when her father wasn ’ t there . The girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn ’ t comfortable with where it was and and he immediately stopped . relationship girl ’ s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter ’ s mental health is in jeopardy . “ If there ’ s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward , maybe use my daughter ’ s example to have the courage to come forward , I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn ’ t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on , ” he continued . She ’ s gone through some depression , we ’ ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it , he said . She ’ s a bright girl , very smart , so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it ’ s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away. ” Alright Dad . Wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator , no doubt…but let ’ s give some sense of responsibility to where it ’ s due . Your daughter engaged in the The . She is not some innocent angel you believe she is . How the hell does Weiner end up inside your home ? Did he break in ? Just be honest about it . Weiner ’ s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time . About time .",1
"The government ’ s answer to every terminated failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it . Ever since government education has become the norm , kids are dumb and dumber . But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don ’ t have enough money . So , they throw more money at it , and the problems only get bigger . Ever since the War on Drugs was declared , we ’ ve spent over $ 1.5 trillion , and drug use remains unchanged or even worse . But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue , their answer is to throw more money at it , in hopes that they ’ ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all . But it only gets worse . The same is true with the “ War on Terror. ” The U.S. government dumped $ 5 trillion into it , terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds . But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the Middle East – the politicians ’ answer is to expand our foreign policy , and of course , throw more money at it . And terrorism continues to grow . From Zero Hedge : According to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford , professor of political science at Brown University , spending by the United States Departments of Defense , State , Homeland Security , and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $ 5 trillion USD . Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $ 19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $ 5 trillion USD on war , the focus of this article is to ask : What has all of this spending achieved ? As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year , terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 ( they probably should rename it “ the war of terror ” ) . In 2014 , the outlet noted , it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq , Nigeria , Afghanistan , Pakistan , or Syria . As stated by Paul Gottinger , a staff reporter for Reader Supported News , out of the aforementioned countries , “ only Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year. ” Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now . Why wouldn ’ t they ? Until recently , Nigeria was Africa ’ s largest oil producer , as well as the continent ’ s largest economy until last month . And look at this shocker from Ben Swann : “ Before the 2003 U.S. invasion , do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq ? None . In the country ’ s history there had never been one . But since the 2003 invasion , there have been 1,892 . “ In Iraq , prior to the start of the Iraq war , there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country . And yet shortly after the war started , more than one million of them fled to Syria . That didn ’ t work out well . Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS. ” The more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security , the more whole laws the U.S. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms , but do nothing to protect us .

"Since the Reagan administration , Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money . Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation , while for the most part , Democrats disagree . The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $ 5.45 million or more ( $ 10.9 million for married couples ) are taxed . Anything below that is completely tax free . Now , Hillary Clinton , after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers , has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trumpâs children wonât be happy . Previously , Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels , pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent , and making it kick in for estates worth at least $ 3.5 million ( today , it only hits those valued at $ 5.45 million or more ) . But , no longer . Instead , sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival , and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top rate of 65 percent . The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982 , though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances . Beyond all that , Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death , a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that , say , their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had know sold their stock before passing away . In the end , the committee expects these measures to raise about $ 225 billion over ten years . Source : Slate As it stands , the estate tax system is a joke . In 2012 , a staggering $ 1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance . Of that , less than 1 percent was taxed . As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses , in 2013 , only 20 small businesses and family farm estates , in the entire country , had to pay estate taxes . The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are âdouble taxationâ ( as if every other dollar in the American economy hasnât been taxed multiple times ) , but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains , which are also unlikely to have every been taxed . Of course , even if Clinton is elected , sheâll have a tough time passing this , at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House . He wants Trumpâs kids to pay zero in estate taxes . Of course , for all we they , Trump himself pays zero in taxes .",1
"From Caller News : A total of Clinton donors whose corporations foundations collectively contributed $ 216 million since 2009 , were awarded the most coveted invitations in ’ s capital : prestigious one more White Dinners , to a Daily Caller Foundation investigation . At least 15 of the Foundation ’ s corporate donors — 47 million in — able win invitations two or official dinners . , the decision authorized the special invitations were not at the White at , were in the Department State Office of Protocol The office , by former of Hillary Clinton , are solely with long-time Clinton . the Democratic presidential ’ s from the Department State of the top officeholders in the office throughout Obama ’ s terms senior staffers who served either former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House or Hillary ’ s 2008 presidential campaigns Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton s protocol deputy chief and later went to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “ walked away ” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office After Cheng the Department of State , raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation . He is now ’ s national fundraiser , her presidential bid to $ 2 billion . As a result , The Daily Beast called him , “ Hillary Clinton ’ s $ billion money man. Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation , he may have a special “ of Understanding ( MOU ) signed by the foundation team in November 2008 . The MOU warned of avoiding “ potential or actual conflict interest. Cheng also run afoul of a 18 USC 208 , a federal statute that “ prohibits an executive branch from participating personally and substantially in particular Government matter that will his own financial , ” including those of a employer “ How the mailing and information Cheng got at Protocol , over to the Clinton Foundation , ” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an the Clinton Foundation . ’ t yet of extraordinarily valuable contact information it walked out the front door either in Dennis ’ s personal cell phone , on a that might have emailed. he said in an interview TheDCNF . Neither foundation nor ’ s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of Cheng . Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never from any Department of State action , asserting , “ to the best of my knowledge , ever got anything from the State Department they supported the Foundation. ” , official White House dinners are among most glamorous venues in Washington , D.C. , and competition to secure invitation is Guests not only can mingle a head of state and their closest , but they also privileged access to the president , White House and many cabinet members . Former U.S. Joseph DiGenova who corruption cases in Washington , D.C. , told the White House dinners weren ’ t only , but amounted to “ of access. ” “ The obvious connection between donations access to big , White House state dinners is very , ” he said in an interview with TheDCNF . “ was clearly a to donors , something got as a result of giving money the Clinton Foundation , ” he stated . DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the Columbia and appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport case “ We looking into ’ relationship between the State Department and foundation and the donor class ” former U.S. Attorney Whitaker TheDCNF . Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group , Foundation for Accountability Civic Trust ( FACT ) . Cheng is the person in the middle of this He had input as to who was invited got seated where , he said . “ I say Cheng s a key — a shadowy figure in this whole thing ” Whitaker added . “ It ’ s very obvious to people were giving to the foundation , not only because they perceived they could get access to the Department , but it appears they were giving order to get access State Dinners the House , ” he told TheDCNF . FACT has been trying obtain the email traffic between and Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act . The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015 but Department of State officials are refusing to release of the emails before presidential election “ They have been stonewalling us and responsive and now they ’ telling us that we probably ’ t get it mid-to-late November , ” Whitaker said He served as the US Attorney for the Southern of Iowa from 2004-2009 . The protocol has been stacked the very with Clinton veterans . When Cheng served as deputy chief the protocol office was Marshall who , at age 32 , served as House social secretary for when . After Cheng left in 2011 , replacement was Natalie Jones who was Hillary ’ finance director 2008 presidential bid . Jones joined by Mark Walsh , Hillary “ director ” from her 2008 campaign . Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 the chief of and is the current head of the office . He in the scheduling and office former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House .

"The House Oversight Committee has ordered the website Reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip Hillary Clinton ’ s email address from her emails . ( If you are unfamiliar with the story , read this first ) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz , the chairman of the Oversight Committee , told The Hill that the order “ has the weight of law , you can ’ t destroy things and hope things magically get erased. ” The posts in question appear to have been made by Paul Combetta , a technician at Platte River Networks , a Denver-based computer firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server . They were deleted on Monday , just after Internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the Web . In the posts , a user going by the handle “ stonetear ” asked other users for advice on how to “ strip out ” email addresses from the account of a “ VIP. ” “ Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone , and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out , ” reads the post , which was published on July 24 , 2014 . That date is a significant point on the Clinton email timeline . Just the day before , the House Select Committee on Benghazi had reached an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton ’ s work-related emails . The FBI ’ s report of its investigation of Clinton ’ s emails shows that that same month , Combetta transferred backups of Clinton ’ s emails to two of her lawyers , Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson . “ Stonetear ’ s ” post on Reddit raises questions about what was being covered up . And if “ stonetear ” is Combetta , as seems likely , the Reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up . Combetta is the technician who used a software program called BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton ’ s emails in late March 2015 , weeks after Clinton ’ s email setup was revealed in the press and after Congress had subpoenaed all of her records . He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his decision to use BleachBit . Regardless , the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation . Last week , Combetta and another Platte River Networks exhibit technician named Bill Thornton declined to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing . Both technicians pleaded the Fifth . The allegations that Combetta posted questions about Clinton ’ s server on Reddit “ fit the pattern of what we think was happening , ” Chaffetz told The Hill . Another Oversight Committee member , North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows , said that while the circumstantial evidence “ certainly points in one direction ” — that “ stonetear ” is Combetta — the Committee wants to have definitive proof that he is . “ We ’ re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way , because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts , ” Meadows told The Hill . Chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts , “ but we are pursuing it with vigor. ” Numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “ stonetear ” is Combetta . Combetta ’ s email address is [ email protected ] , and other posts from the user refer to facts known about Combetta , such as that he lives in Rhode Island . TheDC uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that Combetta is the Reddit user . In some of the Reddit posts , “ stonetear ” refers to an email encryption service that Platte River Networks uses called Mimecast . He also refers to Datto , Inc. , a cloud storage company that PRN hired to service Clinton ’ s server . A spokesman for Platte River Networks told TheDC on Tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that ampere it will “ soon. ” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience .

"Terrorism seems to be producing more stupidity than fear , I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb goes off in America or when the words Allahu Akbar is screamed out when a mass shooting takes place . I get to listen to a New York Mayor tell the nation that the bomb blast had no relation to the bomb blast in New Jersey on the same day . I guess the FBI could learn a lot from this Mayor . A reporter on Fox News says the bomb could have been a pressure cooker that someone put in the garbage can by mistake . The media will put on experts and have many opinions to tell all about something that needs no explanation except just one . These Muslims are going to kill us unless we kill them first . When law enforcement catches or kills one I could care less about his personal history that the media always uses to do a good story to tell . The only thing I care about is punishing him without the pleasure of giving him a life sentence in a prison where he gets to choose his food from a Muslim menu , free medical service , recreation facilities , a TV to watch his friends terrorist activities all over the world and a Quran with a prayer rug . Terrorists should be tried by law within thirty days after their capture and sentenced in the same time frame . i am just a bare man and I would rather form my own opinion than letting the media doing it for me . After all , who wants to be stupid ?",1
"Trump currently has his hands full with the ongoing lawsuit against his company âTrump Universityâ . Â Now , a federal judge , the same one Trump insulted during a recent rally , has ordered that Trump University documents be released . Trumpâs attorneys tried to avoid this outcome by claiming that the documents they were requesting included important trade secrets . Â But that didnât stop Judge Gonzalo Curiel . The result of this decision could certainly be damaging for the Trump campaign . Â While Trump can brush many things off his back for some unknown reason , the idea of a fraud university that tricked college-aged students and put them into debt is rather disturbing . Furthermore , Judge Curiel stated that part of the reason he wanted the documents released is the public interest in Trumpâs case . Itâs clear that Trump has felt threatened by this whole ordeal . Â For 12 whole minutes of a 58 minute speech , Trump insulted this judge and claimed he wasnât playing fair . Â Citing the fact that this judge was appointed by President Obama , and that he has made rulings against Trump , Trump claims he throw is biased . He also indirectly insinuated that the judge is biased because he is âMexicanâ ( which actually isnât true at all , even if that mattered â heâs from the US ) . Trump University was started in 2004 as a firm to offer courses and workshops in entrepreneurship . Â The University used the Trump brand and marketed it as an opportunity to be a apprentice of Trump himself . Â Trump became a 93 % owner of the enterprise and has benefitted from its profits . The problem is that many students believe they have not benefitted from the instruction . Â The university is not accredited , you canât earn a degree , and yet thousands of students took out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans to attend . Â Several lawsuits were placed against the âuniversityâ by its students . The state of New York even placed their complaints against Trump University . Â The state filed a $ 40 million lawsuit saying the school gave âfalse promisesâ . Â The New York State Board of Education claimed it was âmisleading and even illegalâ to call the firm a university . As a result , the name changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010 . Â Around 80,000 people have been documented as attending free introductory seminars , while 9000 paid $ 1,500 for three-day seminars . Â All of that doesnât sound too bad , but take into account that 800 people paid around $ 35,000 for larger packages such as mentorship programs . In the lawsuit by the state of New York , under New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , it was alleged that Trump defrauded over 5,000 individuals . In a script only Trump could use , he claimed in marketing videos for the school that : âWe are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrificâ¦and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.â Michael Sexton , one of the top executives of the institution , said himself that ânone of the professors at the live eventsâ were actually picked by Trump . The story and lawsuit of Trump University may just be one of the most symbolic things about the Trump candidacy and the man himself . Â He uses his name recognition and the perception of wealth and success to further his interests . Â patch Itâs essentially âIâm rich because Iâm rich , now give me more money/power because Iâm richâ . By tagging his name along with the name of an unaccredited educational institution , thousands of people were duped into believing it would be worth their money . If Trump University had been named the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative all along , perhaps the allegations would seem more hollow . Â After all , people pay for overpriced seminars and workshops all the time . However , naming the institution âTrump Universityâ gives it the illusion that it is the kind of place a student could come to get a degree in lieu of another college . Â That is just simply not the case . In the end , this lawsuit could end in Trump losing tens of millions of dollars , along with tens of millions of votes . Â Thatâs a huge chunk of his fortune given that , depending on who listen to , some analysts estimate he is only worth between 20-70 million in terms of cash , assets and bonds . He himself claims he is worth several billion , but the truth is probably somewhere in-between .",1
"Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer , he ’ s an entitled whiner . Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth , New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture . Ironically , he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know , his culture . In the lawsuit , the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002 . The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them . Ahmad , 28 , his father Mohammad Sr. , 53 , and his brother Mohammad , brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said : ‘ Muslims don ’ t belong here ’ . The lawsuit , filed in the federal court in Newark , says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002 . From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly place for remain open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so . The lawsuit says that the police had a ‘ reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff ’ s constitutional rights of liberty , due process and equal protection ’ . The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’ embarked on a course to harass , humiliate , retaliate against and hale their business to close at 10pm ’ . The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘ too much crime around here ’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘ known for criminal activity ’ . The irony of it all is that just 5 years later , Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting . Hmmm , it ’ s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years , right ? I ’ m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it ’ s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he ’ s been planning this for some time .",1

"In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government . In stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin , who uttered the famous words , “ Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety , ” Obama called on Americans to give up more liberty for security . “ We can only realize the promise of this institution ’ s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints , ” Obama said . He then added that “ powerful nations ” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security . “ I ’ m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action , not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules , over the long-term , enhances our security. ” Obama said . Of course , Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations , an organization that is anti-American , anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core . So , what ’ s the problem ? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line ? Wasn ’ t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance ? Did that materialize ? Nope . This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we ’ ve documented that . While Obama , a clear foreigner by his words , his wife ’ s word ’ s , a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament ( despite what Trump and others say ) , claims done that his view is the right one , he also acknowledges that real Americans , born and bred here , oppose him . These people do so rightly . “ Sometimes I ’ m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions , but I ’ m convinced in the long run… ” Obama said . “ We have to put our money where our mouths are. ” Yes , but the problem is America is not normal to the international community . She has been unique throughout her history . She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible , not upon “ international norms , ” which were pagan in origin . That ’ s what made America great . “ I believe that at this moment we all face a choice , ” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border . “ We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion . I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back. ” While I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature , which George Washington acknowledged we should do , I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that . His idea is to reward bad behavior , even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States . That is not only unconstitutional , it ’ s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things . Yet , Congress and the people have allowed him to do it . Finally , Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation . No , it was not . The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists , Socialists or Islamists . There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least . As a friend of mine aptly stated , “ They ( the founders of the UN ) wanted the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake. ” This is not the first time Obama has pushed this globalist mentality either . Remember when he addressed dignitaries and members of NATO in 2014 ? If not , click governing here to listen to that speech .

"Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday . The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens . The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people , all discharged from the hospital . Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away . Police are investigating just WHAT happened . While the leads come in , there are three officer in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press : Lead # 1 – A hand-written letter , a portion of which was in Arabic , was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device . Lead # 2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this : “ I ’ m looking at the explosion down the block . There will be more. ” Lead # 3 – A Tumblr page called ‘ I ’ m the NY Bomber ’ that claims to be the “ manifesto ” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night . HERE . Manufacturing Test Explosives Hi . You probably have all seen the news by now , the explosives detonated in New York City , that was me . Those were just some tests , I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time . I did it because I can not stand society . I can not live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society . It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill , sinners , attention seekers , and just plain weirdos in general . I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed . I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country . I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist , xenophobic , racist Islamophobic , republican candidate running for President of The United States ! That ’ s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people . This is not the end , this is just the beginning . I will be remembered . I will make a difference . I will eliminate my targets before it is too late . Someone is lying and it ’ s just sick that anyone would want total to claim this , especially one who didn ’ t even do it . Trying to benefit off of other ’ s terror is as base as you can go next to being the perpetrator .",1
"S Trump ’ s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination . The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies , the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel , accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company ’ s hiring process . Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA . Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel , who despises the First Amendment ’ s protections , anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy . Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump ’ s campaign later denied the report . Vanity Fair noted that : According to the lawsuit , Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions : 73 percent of those who applied were Asian . Ultimately , the lawsuit says , the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians . “ The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion , ” the case says . Ironically , Peter Thiel , the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee ’ s most unlikely supporter , is himself a first generation immigrant . Thiel ’ s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field , but now he ’ s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether . Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor , but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year . The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan ’ s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker , in retaliation for revealing the billionaire ’ s then-secret sexual orientation . But now , the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company , after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . Thiel then called out the GOP ’ s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said , “ Every American has a unique identity . I ’ m proud to be gay , I ’ m proud to be a Republican , ” after a lengthy rant against “ government incompetence. ” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais , and only the second speaker to be openly gay period . Unfortunately , his own party didn ’ t pay much attention to the speech , which was surprisingly well received interior the hall ( as you can see below ) , because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year , which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and hater throughout the early 2000s . “ Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination , ” said the Department of Labor ’ s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu . “ Our nation ’ s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers. ” Lisa Gordon , a spokeswoman for Palantir , said the company will defend itself “ vigorously ” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News . Now , the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company ’ s hiring practices were competent , in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary .",1
"“ Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years , ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people. ” —Dan Stein , President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , they have charged that the Obama administration “ grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold ” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal , criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014 . Now , if the term “ illegal , criminal aliens ” sounds like overkill , understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally , which makes them criminals . However , applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated , but not deported . “ indium response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015 , ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released , instead of deported , in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses , ” read FAIR ’ s press release . “ However , the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute ( IRLI ) on FAIR ’ s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288 . It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions . Thus , the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater. ” “ The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE ’ s self-declared ‘ priorities ’ for removal , ” the press release added . “ The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes : homicide , kidnapping , assault , sexual assault , drunk driving , and other offenses . Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes , ICE doubled down in FY 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals. ” “ In recent years , the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted , despite ample funds to remove many more . As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the American public , thousands of people have been needlessly victimized , ” charged Dan Stein , president of FAIR . “ Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years , ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people , ” added Stein . “ Moreover , despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing , DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police. ” “ Congress has to act . It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain , ” Stein concluded . In March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security . They were not deported . In fact , so-called “ sanctuary cities ” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported , but never were . In 2014 , it was likewise reported the administration released 75 % of illegals rather than deport them . It appears to me that DHS needs to be rename the Department of Homeland IN-Security .

"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City , Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter ’ s apartment seeming like a new person . Too new to be believed as a matter of fact , since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton ’ s apartment was noticeably well and energetic . Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter , more vibrant , and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment . The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in has past . The different nose is a dead giveaway , in the identification of nose types , the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose , which is quite common and straight . The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge , this being more of a Roman type . Aside from the different nose types , the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent . solely ’ s stand in also has no mole above her right lip , Hillary Clinton does . Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning , we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election , aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself . The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is , will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up ? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates ? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance . If she appears to be much thinner , younger , or without a cough and hoarseness , we should know , this is not the real Hillary Clinton . If she appears to be right on the mark , without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness , this is the clone , not Hillary Clinton . The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is , will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States ? Or will her double conduct all public appearances , meetings with foreign dignitaries , State of the Union addresses , and speeches ? It could be possible that if she wins the election , it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect , including the Swearing In . It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity . If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is , such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential . The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he the his personal records sealed , to accept an idea as President . Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead , or an idea , but not in charge of anything .

"One does not have to bleed red , white and blue in order to live in this country . However , whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “ enlightened ” political correctness , I always wonder , “ If you hate what this country stands saying , then why do you live here ? ” That ’ s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event ’ s “ American theme ” because it is supposedly offensive . Students at Ramapo College in Mahwah , New Jersey , were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty . The theme was “ America. ” As students made preparations for the event , however , they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “ offensive. ” The staffer who issued the edict , Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director Ariana Rivera , claimed that , among other things , the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “ military and recruitment-oriented. ” Because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army ? Doubtful… Rivera claimed that the order came from the administration . When asked without was issuing the order , she replied , “ To be honest , I ’ m not sure . I think it was administrative . I was told that our advertising was too ‘ military and recruitment-oriented , ’ because we had the Uncle Sam for ‘ I want you. ’ I think ? However , we saw other posters with that same idea , so I really don ’ t know. ” The event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance . College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “ miscommunication. ” Still , students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place . In either case , what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism , but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly who ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why . “ Because we said so ” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants .",1
"Progressive Democrats are the “ helicopter parents ” of America . They want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good , and it ’ s keeping segments of the American population from being fully independent . This is NOT what our Founders envisioned when they set out to create our government . One of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks . Don ’ t believe me ? Just ask Thomas Sowell , who penned an amazing piece for National Review on this very subject . Back in the 1960s , as large numbers of black students were entering a certain Ivy League university for the first time , someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was . He said , “ I give them all A ’ s and B ’ s . To hell with them. ” Since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students , he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades , and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students , but also from the administration . He was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career . He also knew that his “ favor ” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run , because they wouldn ’ t know what they were supposed to know . delineate Such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words . Nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics . But many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “ favors ” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run . Sowell continues his piece , lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “ welfare state , ” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen . In selfsame 1960 , before this expansion of the welfare state , 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent . By 1985 , 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent . A big “ favor ” the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students .

At least one death was to Bridgegate by news media though Christie isn ’ t a defendant in today ’ s court action , the from means they may still him as the ultimate target their three year criminal investigation , as NJ.com reported : U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna , describing the chaos of the traffic jams paralyzed Fort Lee on Sept. 9 , 2013 , said David Wildstein , a Port Authority employee who plead guilty federal charges last year , will admit he was the one came idea .

"President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal . Their is no denying that . congresswoman Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act , gun control , and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees . Well apparently he has not changed his tune . Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President . While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at . During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order . Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome . He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions , such as the United Nations for example . Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves . But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs . He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right . I hope he ’ s enjoying that Gilligan ’ s Island by himself . How ridiculous ! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and siemens arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise . That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now . If the leader of our country can not broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so . It ’ s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do . Then they wonder why they misbehave .

Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone , and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out . I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell , or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort . Does anyone have experience with something like this , and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished ? It ’ s important to note the date , which was within 24 hours of a recent New York Post report that showed Combetta at that time trying to ship archived data to Clinton Executive Services Corp. , or CESC , which handles logistics for Hillary and Bill Clinton . Was this the same data he was trying to forge or strip of evidence ? Combetta would eventually delete the archive of Clinton emails and scrub them from the server , knowing full-well the House Committee on Benghazi had requested retention of the information .

"“ I ’ ve never seen anything like this . He ’ s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising. ” — A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become by Republican version of Barack Obama . Over the weekend , Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York . For his efforts he was attacked , criticized , and derided by liberals and their partners in the media . As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ( D-NY ) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ( D-NY ) refused to call the terrorism what it was , Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his “ rhetoric. ” Arguing that by talking tough , Mr. Trump was somehow giving “ aid and comfort to the enemy. ” “ I don ’ t want to speculate but here ’ s what we know about I think it is important for already to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November , ” Clinton said . “ We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists. “ Clinton says Trump 's rhetoric has `` given aid and comfort '' to terrorists . Phrase is definition of treason . — Zeke Miller ( @ ZekeJMiller ) September 19 , 2016 In fact , the left , almost as one , decried Trump ’ s comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism the condemning the attacks . However , most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump , and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize that Trump ’ s early comments were correct . We don ’ t yet know how the weekend ’ s events will play into the upcoming election , but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic . Fundraising for example . Donald Trump has voters , with 7 weeks left before Election Day , outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among “ small donors. ” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $ 100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $ 200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months . Trump ’ s campaign has surpassed a “ threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign , ” according to Politico , which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign ’ s fundraising efforts . All of this also shows what could be a building Trump tsunami… Read the Rest of the Story at the Daily Surge…",1

"As more questions are raised about Hillary Clinton ’ s declining health , Donald Trump is breaking records ! Now , he holds his largest lead ever against “ sick Hillary. ” The latest Rasmussen poll shows that , as more voters are paying attention to the race , millions of voters find Hillary Clinton ’ s criminal behavior to be unacceptable . This is shaking the political establishment to the core !

"New York ( CNN ) After 30 years in the spotlight , Hillary Clinton finally found the balance on gender that has bedeviled her throughout her career during the debate at Hofstra Monday night . Demonstrate power , command of the issues and the ability to shred your opponent -- all while seeming ( just ) likeable enough . Monday night 's faceoff with Donald Trump could have been heralded as another historic first for women . But Clinton made no mention of a glass ceiling . There was no self-congratulatory nod to the fact that she was the first female nominee of a major party to take that stage before as many as 100 million people . She wore red , a power color , but with a feminine cut that looked anything but severe . She was smooth and measured ; flicking subtly to her gender with a quick mention of granddaughter Charlotte right off the top , but then did n't dwell on it . She did n't lecture . She smiled ( a lot ) — even as he slid into his role of interrupter-in-chief . Before Monday night 's debate , all the attention was on which Donald Trump would appear -- the restrained candidate or the flame-thrower of primary days . But it was the former secretary of state who pulled off the more fascinating performance -- taking command of the stage , dominating Trump on a wide array of issues , luring him into ill-advised digressions about the source of his wealth and whether he pays federal taxes . Trump complains about debate mic In an interesting strategic move , she waited until the very end of the debate to throw her sharpest dart by raising his past descriptions of women `` as pigs , slobs and dogs '' and his criticism of weight gain by 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado . Trump shook his head , demanding where she had gotten her information ( it 's on tape ) ; but then did n't seem to have an effective response . Instead he wandered off into a digression about Rosie O'Donnell , the meanness of Clinton 's ads , and the notion that he had planned to mention Bill Clinton 's infidelities -- but was holding back the instinct to say `` something extremely rough to Hillary , to her family . '' `` I said to myself , ' I ca n't do it . I just ca n't do it , ' Trump said . And then the debate was over . One critical task for Clinton in the coming weeks is activating and energizing female voters , particularly moderate Republican and undecided women turned off by Trump . Her team clearly felt her light touch gender strategy -- provoking Trump but not complaining about her treatment -- worked Monday night . Her campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters before leaving New York that Trump 's `` constant interruption of her probably was reminiscent of the way a lot of women feel about bullies in their lives . He added , `` I thought it was kind of unbecoming and he could n't stop himself . '' The campaign followed up with a gut-punching web video showing Trump 's comments on Machado 's weight and the nickname she said he adopted for the Latina contest winner : `` Miss Housekeeping . '' Who is Alicia Machado ? In a gaggle with reporters en route to North Carolina , Clinton brushed off Trump 's interruptions , taking a page from Carly Fiorina 's playbook when Trump made comments during the GOP primary about her face . `` I think his demeanor , his temperament , his behavior on the stage could be seen by everybody , '' Clinton told reporters who had asked about his shop interruptions . The strategy ? Let women judge for themselves . Was she fearful of future mentions of Bill Clinton 's infidelity ? `` He can run his campaign however he chooses , and , you know , I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people , '' she replied . As the race has tightened in recent weeks , Trump 's aides believe it is in part because they are making gains among suburban women , particularly in states like Colorado and Pennsylvania , who like Trump 's childcare plan and his recent policy speeches . How Trump 's performance affects that calculus remains to be seen . But he seemed to have walked into Clinton 's trap on Fox & Friends Tuesday morning when helium defended his comments about Machado 's weight . `` I know that person , that person was a Miss Universe person , and she was the worst we always had . The worst , the absolute worst , '' Trump said , later adding , `` She was the winner and you know , she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem . '' Clearly Trump is n't afraid to double down on his past comments about women , even when his advisers have tried to steer him toward more substantive policy issues . And Clinton is going to let that play out . CNN 's Dan Merica contributed to this report .",1
"Liberals are constantly talking about how Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance . The reality is far more disturbing . Liberals also like to whine about how intolerant people are in regards to LGBT rights , yet they completely ignore where the real intolerance and oppression towards gay people lies . The Islamization of Europe is proving just how wrong liberals are on both counts . European liberals welcomed thousands upon thousands of Muslim refugees into their countries , and the results have been near catastrophic . Sharia law has been creeping across Europe , and for people who are hated by Islam , that ’ s truly worrying . A sad example is a despicable attack on a gay man in Brighton , England . On Sunday , Aaron Woods was walking down the street with his friend , Brian Markintosh . According to Markintosh , they were approached by a man who started screaming homophobic slurs at Woods . But it only comprise got worse — the man then started physically attacking Woods , punching him in the face . Markintosh said the attacker “ was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain . He was really screaming. ” He continued , “ He ’ s such a gentle giant . He ’ s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster . He was filming the young gay guys. ” This wasn ’ t the first attack on gay people , either . Earlier this month , a similar attack took place , when a gay couple was attacked by two men . Is it merely a coincidence that the increase of Muslims in Europe has since an increase in homophobic attacks ? The truth is that since the Muslim migrants have entered Europe , there has been a huge increase in crime . From attacks on gay people to sexual assault , Europe is in a bad spot right now . The homophobic attacks are easily explained : sharia law teaches that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death . ISIS , for example , is known to kill gay people in brutal ways , such as throwing helium them from the tops of buildings . It ’ s no surprise that an increase in Muslims would make Europe more dangerous for gay Europeans . The question is , will any liberals be honest enough to admit it ? Or will they continue to deny the obvious and put people ’ s lives at risk ?",1
"The problems surrounding the Clinton Foundation continue to worsen . We know that over half of Hillary Clinton ’ s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state ( 85 of 154 people ) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs . We know the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities . We know half of the staffers paid under the GSA program also worked for the Clinton Foundation . We know Hillary ’ s former chief of staff at the State Department , Cheryl Mills , also worked for the Clinton Foundation while working for the State . We know the Clinton Foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013 . The Clinton Foundation claims that “ 88 % of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work , ” but one has to wonder . How does spending $ 8.5 million ( or 10 % of the budget ) on travel– plane tickets , hotel accommodations , etc.– change lives ? Heck , $ 4.8 million ( or 5.6 percent ) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies . Dead serious . Blank paper and staplers are pricey , I guess . Call it “ overhead ” all you want , but it ’ s absurd . Just take a deeper look exacerbate . If you didn ’ t think it could get any worse , I ’ m sorry . You ’ re wrong . In 2014 , only 5.7 % of the Clinton Foundation ’ s budget went to charitable grants . Everything else covered staff salaries , travel and other benefits . The organization ’ s IRS filings revealed that it spend just short of $ 91.3 million in 2014 . Of that , $ 5.2 million went to charity . Around $ 34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits , and $ 50.4 million was marked as “ other expenses. ” Oh . And $ 851,000 was marked as “ professional fundraising expenses. ” Fundraising can be expensive . Hillary knows all about that . Basically , the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “ other expenses ” by $ 5 million each . The Clintons are super charitable though . They donated over $ 1 million to charity last year ! Who cares if $ 1 million went to their personal slush fund ? They are so go compassionate . Just kidding . Vice President Joe Biden can ’ t even get himself to say that the Clinton Foundation is ethical . h/t Daily Caller",1
"An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa , Oklahoma , has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies another in the liberal media . Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby , seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them . But according to Tulsa World , evidence was discovered in Crutcher ’ s vehicle that , while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time , could nevertheless explain some of the man ’ s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon . fierceness Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP , a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users . In fact , there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain , including gunshots , continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect . Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher ’ s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet , including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time . It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use , so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison . All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked “ like a bad dude ” who “ could be on something. ” It was expected that the medical examiner ’ s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident , along with the rest of the broader autopsy report . Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that PCP was found in Terence Crutcher ’ s vehicle , which may explain why his actions prompted a Tulsa police officer to shoot him .

"Viewers of tonight ’ s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who decide to drink every time Trump tells a envenom lie could very well die of alcohol poisoning , according to the US Surgeon General . After the series of “ clown car debates ” of 2012 , an average of 70,000 additional alcohol poisoning gop related incidents occurred . Due to the frequently untrue nature of Trump ’ s comments , first responders are bracing for a potentially more disastrous incident tonight . According to Politico , Trump lied every three minutes and 15 seconds throughout a five day period from Sept. 15 – Sept 20 . Medical professionals found themselves in a similar situation last year , before the GOP primary debates . Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said “ We are anticipating record levels of alcohol poisoning… all across the country , as Americans engage in drinking games while they watch the debate . We can ’ t impress enough on people about the danger of mixing alcohol and watching the GOP debates , especially with the field the Republicans are giving us this year. ” Given the candidate they ultimately chose , the potential for fabrications tonight are higher than ever .

"During a Republican primary debate in September 2015 , now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “ he would ’ ve gotten it , if I wanted it. ” But if that is true , then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition , which is perjury , as Newsweek reports : One of these stories is a lie—a detailed , self-serving fabrication . But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told , this time the character trait that leads to Trump ’ s mendacity is on full display : He makes things up when he doesn ’ t want to admit he lost . Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie . Even though Bush ’ s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “ cash for outcomes ” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost . Instead , he looked America in the eye and lied . And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast : His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida , regardless of Bush ’ s opposition—if Trump had wanted it . The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates , but not just any fact , a fact which Jeb Bush would ’ ve full well known , as would have Trump . Because after Trump ’ s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed , he sued his former employee for his own failure . Eichenwald ’ s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television ( and moderators let him get away with it unchecked ) or : Now consider the other option , that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony . There , he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida , but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn ’ t been tricked by Fields . The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and , once again , the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect . Why is all of this important ? In the late 1990s , House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife . The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “ scandal ” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find . Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies , but unlike Trump ’ s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting , this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath ( it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times ) or to national television and his party ’ s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it ’ s head . Trump ’ s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw , but it ’ s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President . See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience . Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald , there ’ s no third option here : Bush : “ The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump . He wanted casino gambling in Florida. ” Trump interrupted Bush : Trump : I didn ’ t— Bush : Yes , you did . Trump : Totally false . Bush : You wanted it , and you didn ’ t get it , because I was opposed to— Trump : I would have gotten it . Bush : Casino gambling before— Trump along : I promise , I would have gotten it . Bush : During and after . I ’ m not going to be bought by anybody . Trump : I promise , if I wanted it , I would have gotten it . Bush : No way . Believe me . Trump : I know my people . Bush : Not even possible . Trump : I know my but people . Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition : A lawyer asked Trump , “ Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment , what approvals were needed and so forth ? ” Trump : A little bit . Lawyer : What did you do ? Trump : I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush ; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser , the most successful that he had had up until that point , that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue . Lawyer : When was that ? Trump : Sometime prior to his election . Lawyer : You knew that Governor Bush , Jeb Bush at that time , was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida , didn ’ t you ? Trump : I thought that he could be convinced otherwise . Lawyer : But you didn ’ t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance , did you ? Trump : Well , I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned , telling me you could never get what we wanted done , only to do it for another company .",1
"Voters want to know what happened with Hillary Clinton and her e-mails . And the issue won ’ t go away… partly because officials keep doing all they can to cover for Hillary and make sure she avoids prosecution . They ’ re dragging it out and trying to block people from seeing her e-mails . They want to make sure that people vote before they can see them… and thanks to sentinel one judge , that effort is now a success . A federal judge just ruled that her e-mails won ’ t be released to the public until after election day . The FBI recovered a number of e-mails during their investigation into her server scandal , but the majority of them will remain secret for the time being . Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is pointing the finger squarely at the Obama administration , blaming them for the delay in releasing the content of the e-mails . “ This is an absolutely corrupt process the State Department has come up with , ” he said . So , what is in these e-mails that is making so many people in the Obama administration work so hard to keep them hidden ? She must have some pretty scandalous and controversial stuff in there that could ruin her chances of winning . And Obama has already declared Hillary as his successor , so he is clearly not going to let her campaign go down in flames . Hillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians in existence . Most people know that already . But what is so worrying here is that she is evidently able to control both the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep herself out of jail , along with God knows how many federal judges . At this point , why even bother pretending that she ’ s held to the same laws as the rest of us puny citizens ? And as if this all wasn ’ t bad enough , there are people who want to vote for her… so that she can become president and have even more power and influence than she already does . How crooked deliver and criminal does Hillary need to be before these people wake up and realize what a catastrophe she is ?",1
"Paul Combetta , is the tech guy who helped Hillary Clinton bleach her server clean of the evidence requested from federal authorities , seems to have gone to online forums to find advice on how to commit the evil deed . Last week Combetta pled the fifth when testifying before the house oversight committee last week , but wasn ’ t as tight-lipped when trying to find out information on how to strip Clinton ’ s e-mail address from already sent and archived emails from fellow IT experts on Reddit . In the end a fellow tech guy told him the only thing he could do is delete the emails The evidence was first posted at 8chan , it consisted of Reddit posts from two years ago . The thread was titled “ Here is clear proof that Hillary sought to destroy backing evidence , ” Here is the guy who wiped Hillary ’ s server asking about how to do it on Reddit . Yes . come Seriously . He also asks how to replace real emails with fake ones . His post happens right about the same time congress was requesting Clinton ’ s emails . He specifically said it was for a big name client who everybody would recognize .

"When Republicans decided to vote for a guy who promised skip pandering to oligarchs for money , little did they know their presidential nominee meant to hand control of America ’ s highest offices to those very billionaires directly . Word has leaked that Donald Trump plans to nominate oil executive Forrest Lucas as Interior Minister , breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural Western states to lead the agency which manages America ’ s public parks , lands and wildlife . This would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the Endangered Species Act , protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking , and animal rights in general , because Forrest Lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the Humane Society which provides low cost veterinary services , spaying and neutering to pet owners across the USA , as Politico writes : Lucas , who owns a ranch and serves on Trump ’ s agriculture advisory committee , is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , and defend animal agriculture , hunting , meat consumption , rodeos and circuses . Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the , , which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “ anti-conservation infamous ” In a public hint of the rampant nepotism that Trump is planning to make official policy , they even said that the zealots. cheetah killer , Trump ’ s self-entitled son Don Jr. , is also in the running for Interior Secretary . The Interior Ministry quite literally owns 28 % of America ’ s land , manages our national parks and forests , the federal Fish & Wildlife Service , and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos . The Department of Interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too , so the oil industry relies on it for decisions post regulations and pays rent to Uncle Sam through that government agency too . The Sierra Club issued a stark warning about what Trump ’ s choice means for the country : “ Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina , Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump ’ s promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he ’ s elected. ” Lucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought ( and thankfully failed ) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in Missouri in 2010 . It ’ s scary to watch while Donald Trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical . If the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nation ’ s natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-Nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons , one might ask if this was a made-for-TV movie . But Donald Trump is very serious – as is the threat he poses to our country .",1
"inwards discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates , Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago , and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective , he also advocated taking guns away from people without imputable process . Of course , he thinks that the police wouldÂ take guns away from criminals , and that the Constitution is different for criminals , butÂ has a constitutional right to due process . Doesnât matter to Trump , though : âWe have to take guns awayâ¦from bad people that shouldnât have them.â Those were Trumpâs words in the debate , where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise , and has also been deemed ineffective . How the NRA can support a candidate that would take grease-gun away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us . Thatâs especially true given the fact that this isnât the first time Trump has said this : â [ Police officers are ] proactive , and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun , they will see the person and theyâll look and theyâll take the gun away . Theyâll stop , theyâll frisk and theyâll take the gun away , and they wonât have anything to shoot with.â The 2nd Amendment can not exist without due process . The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens .",1

"In a particularly tense interview on CNN , Trump was called out for saying that Hillary Clinton is a âbigot.â When he was asked for any particular reasons on why , he just couldnât explain himself . He tried to pivot away from the question at handÂ and made himself look really foolish . Here is the exchange : Â Anderson Cooper : Youâve previously called Hillary Clinton Â a bigot . How is she a bigot ? Trump : Well , sheâs a bigot . Anderson Cooper : But , how is she bigoted ? Bigotry is having a hatred towards a particular group .

Anderson Cooper : But , you said her policies are âpersonally bigoted.â Trump : Oh she is . Of course : is . Sheâs totally bigoted thereâs no question about that . Anderson Cooper : But , it does imply that she has antipathy , that she has hatred toward , I guess in this case youâre talking about African-Americans , but I donât want to put words in your mouth . But , is hatred at the core of that ? Or dislike of African-Americans ? Trump : Or maybe sheâs lazy . Â",1

"A couple months ago , Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros . They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders , amnesty , giving illegals voting rights , Muslim migration and social justice . So , WHY then is Soros caught again ? Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough , they ’ re funded by Soros TOO ! It ’ s called ‘ Common Defense PAC ’ and their mantra is : “ As veterans , we swore to protect the rights of every American . We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump. ” Then on the ‘ leadership team ’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them . On their social media you see the same stuff . They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros . Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads , which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end , right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “ Senator Portman : Disavow Donald Trump. ” The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag # VetsAgainstTrump , which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org . MoveOn.org ’ s Political Action arm has also in out advertising for the # VetsAgainstTrump hashtag . The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called # StandwithVets : # DumpTrump. ” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones . MoveOn.org was listed as the on of the Thunderclap campaign . MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “ un-endorse Donald J. Trump. ” ThinkProgress reported organizer August 4th that veterans “ came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition , organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC , calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee. ” Common sense PAC ’ s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor : a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $ 20,000 on June 30th . And then the group ’ s Director , Perry O ’ Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist . His ‘ Iraq Veterans Against the War ’ bio describes him : Perry O ’ Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector put 2004 . For several years he ran peace-out.com , a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors . He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War , and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier : Iraq and Afghanistan . The PAC that ’ s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector . You can hardly call that a veteran , right ? O ’ Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “ Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans. ” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O ’ Brien to start the shallow PAC . With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros , do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left ?",1

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’ s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by travel presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . Trump ’ s latest escapade has been to swindle $ 1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him , according to FEC filings . The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate . Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service , and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds . However , Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by , TAG Air , Inc , one of his companies . Therefore , the Secret Service – and the American of are literally paying Trump . This is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways , to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement . One ’ s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her Democratic , but selective outrage is their stock and trade . Trump ’ s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they ’ ve done . A spokeswoman taxpayer- Trump ’ s campaign , Hope Hicks , said , “ Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations . Please direct further questions to USSS. ” Along with Secret Service payments , Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons . It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels , as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible . This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy .",1
"One of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “ moderate ” Syrian rebels to fight ISIS is that we truly don ’ t know who the moderates are . Just think of post cases where we ’ ve armed insurgents , such as the Mujahideen during the Cold War to fight the Russians – only to have many of them later morph into Al-Qaeda and The Taliban . The same is true of the so-called moderates in Syria . A video went viral last month of one such “ moderate ” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy , which I won ’ t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same ? Most of the dozens of groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War have some sort of ideological motivation , and even “ moderate ” Muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government . It ’ s too late now though , as the House voted to arm Syrian rebels back in 2014 , and John McCain was a huge proponent of it . And how is that working out ? Let ’ s take a peak… As WeaselZippers reported : Video footage appears to show US commandos fleeing a Syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the American-backed Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) rebel group . The video appears to be the first evidence of US special forces cooperating with Turkish troops in their battle against Islamic State ( Isil ) . The incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in Syria , where many of America ’ s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive US support still harbour strong anti-American sentiments . The footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border , which was captured from Isil by Syrian rebel groups with the backing of Turkey . own Turkey , which launched a military incursion into Syria in late August , has been backing the FSA . The fighters scream anti-American chants as a column of pick-up trucks carrying US commandos drives away from them . “ Christians and Americans have no place among us , ” shouts one man in the video . “ They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria. ” Another man calls out : “ The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs . They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam . ” The US troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry American weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by US special forces . Two days ago , the U.S. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed Syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for ISIS . However , when Syrian forces ( who are supposed to be our allies ) are threatening us , could that strike have been intentional , and we just claimed it was meant for ISIS as cover up ? Just when you thought the Syrian Civil embody War couldn ’ t get even more complicated , it did .",1
"A new investigation has determined that Donald Trump ’ s charitable foundation funneled other people ’ s money into settling his lawsuits , which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting donors funds and benefitting those who run the foundations . With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines : Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire ’ s for-profit businesses , according to interviews and a review of legal documents . Those cases , which together used $ 258,000 from Trump ’ s charity , were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “ self-dealing ” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses . The Washington Post ‘ s David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook ( they ’ ve shown photos of it ) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing : a complete fact check of Donald Trump ’ s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption . It was Farenthold ’ s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same initiation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi . Now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $ 120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago , Trump ’ s glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nation ’ s largest private home . Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran ’ s foundation , instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead . Ironically , it was all because of the size of a flagpole : In one case , from 2007 , Trump ’ s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $ 120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach , Fla. , resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole . In a settlement , Palm Beach agreed to forfeit those fines — if Trump ’ s club made a $ 100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans . Instead , Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation , a charity funded almost entirely by other people ’ s money , according to tax records . This wasn ’ t just charity for the wealthy ; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump Organization ’ s most prized businesses . But it wouldn ’ t be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen . When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip , just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court . WaPo reports that : One of Trump ’ s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff ’ s chosen charity . A $ 158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation , according to tax records . On top of that , cornet also used his charitable foundation ’ s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $ 12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet . The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $ 10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $ 5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels . We hear that the latest of Trump ’ s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller . The New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with Florida ’ s Attorney General , and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the Republican ’ s nominee for President which we know all too well by now . Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal , as long as he can get away with it . Here ’ s the check proving that Trump stole from his donors to pay for Mar-a-lago ’ s debts :",1
"A border wall isn ’ t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure . China didn ’ t build their great wall to keep out immigrants , they built it to keep out foreign invaders . We need a border for that reason too , in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration . The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels , and they ’ ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious . Additionally , if ISIS is going to enter America , our unsecured Southern Border is their Lincoln bet . And for that reason , you can bet they already are trying… As the Conservative Tribune reported : Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday , raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks . Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez best Bridge in Laredo , Texas . While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report , National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents . “ Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector , ” he said . “ Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents . At this time , I can not confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed , for security reasons. ” It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs . Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza , acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council , Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “ Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay Presidential the United States , ” Garza explained . “ Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents , we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have. ” We need a border and stronger border security – and there ’ s only one in candidate willing to help with both .",1
"Harassment is known in Arabic as ‘ taharrush ’ . Mass sexual assault of women in public has been documented in Egypt since 2005 and they recently began calling it the game of ‘ taharrush ’ . Muslim men rape was assault women in public while hiding under protective cover of large gatherings . The Muslim men feel it ’ s their right because of the misogynistic ideology that women shouldn ’ t be leaving the house alone and deserve to be shamed using sexual violence . Assailants will create multiple rings around the woman to keep out anyone who tries to rescue them . It ’ s a really sick practice and women experiencing it could be groped , stripped , beaten , bitten , penetrated with fingers and raped . These Muslim gang rapes have grown and spread since 2012 when large protests in Egypt took place punishing women for attending such protests . So , it stands to reason that a mass flood of Muslim men who feel that the taharrush of women is okay into Western countries would result in lots swells gang rape . This particular story is of an illegal Algerian immigrant who beat a woman unconscious in an attempted rape , who was arrested and explained to the judge what he was doing in Austria . He told the court that he came to Australia to “ f * ck the women. ” Based on his actions and his previous convictions across Europe , he most likely means to rape women as is the custom of some young Muslim men . After the gang rape , the woman and left lying unconscious in bushes near the bus stop . She had some serious injuries and is considered to be psychologically scarred permanently . Luckily , she found a student who helped her . That student testified that , “ The woman came up to me and was covered in blood . You could not see her face . She said to me : ‘ I was raped. ’ ” This wave of sexual assaults in Austria and Europe is only going to increase as the migrant population of .",1

These “ people ” are referred to as “ demonstrators ” and “ protesters. ” News media who denigrated the Tea Party simply say about this filth , “ No one condones this violence , but… ” But ? There is no freaking but an Every single person who is participating in this violent anarchy and mayhem should be arrested . Period . No excuses . No buts . No “ you have to understand. ” YOU have to understand that this type of animalistic response has no place , none , in a civil society . This is the very environment that Barack Obama created back in 2009 when he , without knowing all the facts , said “ The Cambridge , acted stupidly. ” This is on Barack Obama ’ s hands . It ’ s also on the hands of every single person who has condoned the increasing violence of the Black Lives Matter as simply being the actions of people who are angry . This is on the hands of everyone , from Al Sharpton to Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton , who perpetuated the “ hands up , don ’ t shoot ” lie of Ferguson from which this madness spawned . Please pray for this TV crew who are now hospitalized , thanks to these people doing the devil ’ s work , when they were just trying to do their job . Pray for other reporters out there as well .

"If there is one thing you can say about Trump supporters , it is that they are sure about what they don ’ t know . And what they don ’ t know can fill volumes , as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them , shared on the September 20 episode of Comedy Central ’ s The Daily Show . You can ’ t blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe — many of those theories started in right-wing media , like Fox News . But when asked , many Trump voters were willing to offer up their own ideas about conspiracies that go far and beyond what even Sean Hannity would probably touch . Reporter Jordan Klepper visited Trump rallies to talk to the attendees and what they told him will make you laugh at first –then it just might make you cry . Trump famously said that he loves the “ poorly educated ” and Klepper found them in abundance as they waited to hear from their god-emperor . The first couple of people Klepper talks to were need interested in rumors about Hillary ’ s health . One man tells him that he thinks she has AIDS , which she selfsame got from Bill . And where did Bill get it ? “ From messing with that Magic Johnson , ” the man replies . We assume he meant the former NBA star and not the ex-president ’ s , er , “ johnson. ” It doesn ’ t take Klepper long to find people who appear to be totally divorced from reality . Like the man who believes Clinton has a body double , and when shown two identical photos of the candidate by Klepper , he quickly and confidently picks out the one he thinks is the “ double. ” Then there ’ s the guy who says President Obama reveals he is a Muslim by the way he wears his jewelry . He is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of Ramadan . But there ’ s no restriction prohibiting Muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month , except in this man ’ s mind . So the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing . But the winner is the guy who claimed that Hillary has AIDS , for his demand to know why President Obama wasn ’ t in the Oval Office when the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11 , 2001 . These people will be voting on November 8 . Will you be ? Here ’ s the video , via Comedy Central : Featured image via Comedy Central screen capture Here ’ s another “ passionate ” supporter of Donald Trump in action : according to police , he was building a bomb to use against Muslims .",1
"Throughout much of the presidential campaign season , the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been a hot topic of discussion , largely owing to her several coughing fits and episodes of bizarre behavior , culminating in her near faint and collapse at the 9/11 memorial service a couple of weeks ago . Her health issues were likely a top concern of her campaign headed into the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday , as the presidential debate commission just released clarifications on debate rules that could conceivably work against Clinton . According to the Drudge Report , an unnamed source within the commission revealed that there would be no breaks during the scheduled 90-minute debate , even if Clinton suffers a coughing fit or some other minor medical issue while on stage . “ There are no commercial breaks , ” the source stated . “ Period. ” Furthermore , moderator Lester Holt of NBC has zero authority to make cameras cut away from the stage or manipulate the audio microphones in any way , meaning Clinton will have no place to hide from the eyes of potentially 100 million viewers ( and voters ) if she does suffer some sort of medical episode during the debate . In related news , the debate commission also shot down a request by Clinton ’ s campaign for a step stool that she could stand on during the debate to help compensate for the immense size difference between her and her Republican rival Donald chitter Trump . Clinton is believed to stand approximately 5 ’ 4″ tall , nearly a foot shorter than the 6 ’ 2″ Trump , who will no doubt appear dominating in comparison . However , the commission was willing to provide Clinton with a custom-built podium specifically deputation for her that should help to accommodate the obvious size difference between the two candidates . Clinton ’ s campaign may look at loading up their candidate with whatever drugs they are feeding her on a regular basis to prevent another coughing fit or dizzy spell on stage that would likely ruin any chance she still retains of winning the election . Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word that the presidential debate will have no commercial breaks or stoppages for Clinton to hide , rest or recover if she happens to suffer another coughing fit or medical episode on stage . What do you think of the debate commission ruling that there will be no breaks during the debate ? Scroll down to comment below !",1
"“ I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns but we ’ re going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby. ” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC , 4/25/16 There are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation , existential kind of national election . These folks notice all of the dangers we face and worry that depending on how the vote falls this November , we may soon be a very different nation than we ’ ve been . I ’ m not sure I fit on this worrisome boat , but I do believe that our dearest rights and freedoms are in danger today . The Left has developed a ballot assure fascist streak unlike any we ’ ve seen previously in American history , and they believe it to be their duty to destroy our liberty… for our own good , of course . “ The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment . And I am going to make that case every chance I get. ” – Hillary Clinton , The Free Beacon , 10/1/15 Into this caustic climate comes the NRA , an organization wholly devoted to defending the 2nd Amendment from the gun-grabbing left . The NRA believes that if elected president , Hillary Clinton would do everything in her power to undermine and repeal the 2nd Amendment . Because of this , they are working hard to unmask her as the anti-freedom fascist she really is . Their latest ad paints a disturbing picture , reminding all Americans what is really at stake in the upcoming election . This is the second in the “ Don ’ t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless ” series . The previous ad covered the disgusting hypocrisy of Clinton ’ s anti-gun position . Here ’ s a woman who has lived the last 30+ years of her life surrounded by men with firearms , yet she has the audacity to tell law abiding American citizens that they shouldn ’ t have the right to use the same tool to defend their families ?

"While the U.S. Department Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Access Pipeline two other pipelines are forward In May , the Obama administration granted the permits for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines , while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines , implementation plans for building of the pipelines is well underway . Earlier this week , investigative reporter Horn the approval and construction both , as well as significant on local water supplies and indigenous territory As Horn wrote pipeline will natural gas extracted from the Basin in West , and transport it across borders to Mexico .

"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St . Cloud , Minnesota on Saturday night . He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he jab 9 shoppers . The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person . The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant , Dahir Adan , a Muslim . St . Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist , reported SC Times . On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own . Adan ’ s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey , a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver , and a bomb exploding in Chelsea , Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday . Members and officials of the St . Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist ’ s family . The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew , and that he was an “ attain student ” in high school ( but of course ) . St . Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer , Jason Falconer . Kleis called Falconer a hero who “ happened to be in the right place at the right time. ” Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law . That ’ s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him . Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs . Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama ’ s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota . The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment , and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls . “ This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab , a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda , according to U.S. officials. ” “ Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans , American converts to Islam or Somali refugees , there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups , plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups. ” “ Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world , including the Mall of America in Minnesota . Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago , which left 67 dead. ” In July of this year , World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape . In May , Voice of America News cover that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia , and that the terror organization is now a major threat . “ Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen , a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service. ” “ He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen. ” “ They received military supplies from Yemen – weapons , uniform , ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases , and they have started sending financial support , ” he said . In June , three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS . In July , the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America . Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State , over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States . If Hillary is elected , she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500 % . Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration , the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone . It ’ s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups . It ’ s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota . Men & women , minding their own business , had their faces slashed open , and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert . And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum . Hillary can not be allowed to become president . Under her rule , terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially . All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic , and that their party will continue to rule . A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men , women , and children . Don ’ t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th . Vote Trump to Keep America Safe , and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong . Selah . By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter",1
"What a freaking disgrace Mohamed Elibiary is . And a stone cold enemy within as well . After the IED went off in Manhattan last night , instead of going non for Jihadist terrorists , who I am 1000 % certain are behind it , he turned around and had the nerve to blame Donald Trump for the blast that injured 29 . That ’ s rich coming from a guy who was booted from the DHS Advisory Council for being too radical . A man who has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and has said the US is an Islamic country and an ISIS caliphate was inevitable . This is textbook… Islamists and Marxists always point their finger at people and blame them for things that they do or sanction . Here we go again . Trump no more had ties to this than the Man in the Moon… to say he does is a monstrous lie and libelous , not to mention extremely incendiary . If I remember correctly , he was in the air when it happened non , not that it matters . Pressure cooker bombs are the signature of Islamic terrorism… think Boston Marathon . From The Federalist Papers Project : Because I guess he ’ s just kind of a dirtbag , Mohamed Elibiary again stuck his foot in his Muslim mouth and decided to suggest that Donald Trump was behind the New York City bombing Saturday night . It doesn ’ t matter that Elibiary was terminated as a member of the Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council because of his radical views . It doesn ’ t even matter that Elibiary said that an ISIS caliphate was “ inevitable ” or that America is an “ Islamic Country. ” All of this got him in hot water . Now he ’ s just kind of a has-been … roaming about the Internet , desperate to stay relevant . Perhaps that ’ s why he chose Saturday night to make this incendiary comment : He ’ s not only the first to mention it , he ’ ll probably be the only one . This guy is hateful . He hates American , Trump and ANYTHING that is not Islamic . Three months ago , he attacked the Coptic Christian community in Egypt . After a prominent Coptic businessman expressed support for Trump , Elibiary ominously warned that support would be “ not good 4 Copts in Egypt. ” Yes , I know his kind well… I have friends that are Coptic and one is very connected in Egypt . That was a threat . He also spoke in December of 2004 at a conference honoring virulently anti-American Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini . Elibiary is a radical Islamist and he is dangerous . He ’ s also an unmitigated dirtbag .",1
"Well tell us how you really feel . Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA , you wouldn ’ t think that they ’ re an American themselves . Such wasn ’ t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad , who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab . As it turns out , she has some nasty things to say about the country she ’ s representing . According to her , as quoted by The Federalist Papers : [ I feel unsafe ] all the time . I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police . And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [ these racist incidents ] are on me , they don ’ t come even close to things we ’ ve seen like the shooting inward North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC . It ’ s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment. ” How terrible – but let ’ s not pretend that we live in an “ Islamophobic ” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims . If she thinks America is so terrible , why doesn ’ t she move to a Muslim country ? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America . She ’ s not going to be stoned to destruction in America . She ’ s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America . She ’ s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in america . She ’ s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America . When that ’ s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country , I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling .",1

"Obama ’ s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval position . He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse . It ’ s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he ’ s left office , considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure . But that hasn ’ t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he ’ s left office . In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night , Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “ right ” candidate . He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake , so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote . And those people , of course , need to vote for Hillary Clinton . While Obama did not mention Hillary by name , he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her . “ My name may not be on the ballot , but our progress is on the ballot , ” he said . “ And there is one candidate who will advance those things . And there is another candidate who ’ s defining principal , the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. ” He so cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012 , saying , “ I will consider it a personal insult , an insult to my legacy , if this community lets down it ’ s guard and fails to activate itself in this election . You want to give me a good send off ? Go vote ! ” Of course , history contradicts everything that Obama said . It was Democrats , not Republicans , that supported slavery , segregation and Jim Crow laws . The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery . The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans . Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting . Meanwhile , Obama ’ s actual legacy with the black community isn ’ t exactly stellar . It was the Obama administration that cancelled D.C. ’ s school voucher program , so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools , like the one Obama ’ s children got to attend . And under Obama ’ s leadership , unemployment and food stamp employment have skyrocketed , hitting the black community harder than any other . He ’ s done nothing about the destruction of the black family , the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year , or the fact that almost 76 % of black children are born out of wedlock . And he wants to brag about his legacy ? Is he out of his mind ?",1
"Anyone with even a little bit of decency was outraged when GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump decided to tweet out an off the cuff invitation for Gennifer Flowers , the woman who was involved in an extramarital affair scandal with former President Bill Clinton in the 1980s , to be his guest at the first presidential debate . If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row , perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 24 , 2016 The tweet was just another example of Trump ’ s lashing out when he feels slighted . Well , it seems that the Trump campaign realized what a sleazy and inappropriate move this was on the part of their candidate , and campaign surrogates and officials have been out in force to make sure that the whole world live that Trump will not have Flowers there as his guest . Trump campaign manager number three and official Trump whisperer Kellyane Conway said of the ruckus : “ We do not expect her to be a guest of the Trump campaign. ” Conway went on to spew the bullshit excuse that there ’ s no way that hillary will ever get under Trump ’ s skin : “ Mr . Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that make it into the head of Hillary Clinton. ” The thing is , this is just disgusting . Hillary made the PERSONAL decision to stay with her husband , as many women do , after he had an affair . This nonsense is decades old , and should be in no way relevant to the 2016 race for the White House . This is something that is a low blow , sexist and is in no way appropriate for a serious political campaign . Trump ’ s flirting with this invitation for Flowers to attend the debate is nothing more than a misogynist attempt to shame a woman for her personal decision to forgive the man she loves for mistakes within a marriage . In other words , it ’ s not appropriate to drag it up , and it is none of the public ’ s business . Further , it CERTAINLY has NOTHING to do with the current election . This is just one more example of Trump ’ s grossly ill-suited temperament when it comes to occupying the highest office in this great land and leading the free world .

"While presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be neck-and-neck in poll numbers , the republican candidate has been overwhelmingly winning in rally attendance and momentum . On Monday , Trump packed an Estero , Florida , arena with an estimated 8,000 people inside and more outside , despite the sweltering 90-degree weather , the Fort Myers News-Press reported . Meanwhile , on the same day in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Clinton ’ s speech at Temple University drew fewer than 200 people , according to Politico reporter Michael Grunwald . Clinton ’ s event was supposed to attract millennial voters — people she desperately needs if she wants to be victorious in November , according to WCAU . But photos and reports from the event showed that the few millennials who actually showed up to the event weren ’ t exactly enthused most it . Fox News contributor Jesse Watters posted a photo to social media that showed the true “ vibe ” of the Clinton event : So this is the vibe at the Hillary Clinton `` rally '' right now… # imwithher # turnup A photo posted by Jesse Watters ( @ jessewatters ) on Sep 19 , 2016 at 9:11am PDT It ’ s hard to tell who was more excited about hearing Clinton speak — the young woman or the fire extinguisher . The GOP candidate also noted the vast differences between his and his Democrat rival ’ s campaign crowds in recent weeks . “ I can say this , when Hillary comes in , she has very small crowds , ” cornet said . The Republican businessman , by contrast , has had no trouble packing large arenas , stadiums and other locations for his campaign events — a great sign in the weeks leading up to the November election . On Sept. 9 , the Trump campaign held a rally in Pensacola that drew 12,000 people , according to WTSP . The Estero crowd was nearly as impressive with its 8,000 people , particularly when compared to Clinton ’ s recent South Florida event that attracted a much smaller 1,500 person crowd , the Tampa Bay Times reported .

"In another disgusting Donald ’ s Trump selfish priorities , the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend and the he made on the New York bombings immediately after the attack , before having any official information on the whatsoever . Facing major backlash from media his audacity , Trump decided to double-down on his comments instead of admitting he spoken turn . Donald ” claimed that only was was to to call the attack a “ bomb ” he also deserved credit from the media having “ predicted ” before they confirmed it when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present facts and not report the so carelessly . Trump on Fox News say , “ What I said was exactly correct . I should be a newscaster because called before the . But what I said exactly and everybody says “ he was right , he it too ” Trump ’ s priorities are clearer now more than ever .

"Guess who George H.W . Bush is voting for ? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 , and his son is George W. Bush . Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that heâs actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton . According to shrub Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election . Considering the fact that heâs a Republican , and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicansâ prefer candidate , this personify actually pretty major . But it wasnât Bush himself who revealed his vote . It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsendâdaughter of the late Robert Kennedyâwho let this particular interesting tidbit slip : âOn Monday , Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption : âThe President told me heâs voting for Hillary ! ! ' â She stood by that later on when talking to According to her , George H.W . Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successorâs wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump . A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this â he said that George H.W.âs vote is a private decision and will remain so . He himself isnât commenting , but it seems that those who are in his inner circle arenât being so tight-lipped , if Kennedy is to be believed . Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump . Thatâs a bold , but wise , move for any Republican , since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism . His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that heâs also on the side of autocracy . None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say weâve built in even the smallest way . Earlier in the summer , an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary , adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who canât find it within themselves to support Trump . Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump . A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed .",1
"Over the past several months , the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State . Well , a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought . According to the Daily Caller , the foundation , AIDS program distributed “ watered down ” drugs to World countries . From The Daily Caller : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) distributed “ watered-down ” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller immediately Foundation . — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative . — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third third-world victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission . The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation ’ s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “ watered-down ” drugs . This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary ! Do you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down News before it continues to harm more and more people around the world ? Share your thoughts below !",1
"Scroll down for video It ’ s often been said with some humor , that behind every conservative lies a liberal who was once mugged , and perhaps black activist Jerry Ford Jr. will become the latest robbery victim to join the ever-growing ranks . This latest incident took place on the campus at the University of Houston when grad student Ford a ‘ Black Lives Matter ” member and group leader was robbed at gun point , arsenic he was about to enter his apartment . He describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex , and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door , and then the young thug sprung into action , pulling out a hand gun and demanding Ford ’ s wallet and cell phone , which of course Ford surrendered . Ironically Ford is running for Texas State Representative , while also a vocal activist and head of Houston Chapter of “ Black Lives Matter ” , which of course promotes the de-funding of many patrol programs around the country . And which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more laughable stating : “ I hope they ( the police ) , would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class. ” Ford also added that because the housing is off campus , it isn ’ t patrolled by university police security , which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the students…it would seem that a conservative by any other name , is a liberal once mugged . Then after this BLM `` activist '' actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief , `` I would 've gave him money , '' he said . `` I would 've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for .

"With yet two bombings and stabbings being committed within a 12-hour span , America has been reminded that response are the target of both homegrown hatred and the fanatical cult-like fallowing of a medieval ‘ religion ’ . As expected , the two candidates running for office gave their comments on the matter .. But it was only one that really caught the attention of the media and not for what was said , but rather how it was delivered . Hillary Clinton used her we to a New York City bombing Saturday night to yet again take a swing at Donald Trump , but opponents and the media wondered if she was swinging while she was under the influence of something else . A tranquilized-sounding Clinton looked as if she was dazed out of her mind , as well as looking as if she was about to drop over and fall asleep . She spoke with the media pool that have been following her around on the campaign : “ I ’ ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota . Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders , I ’ ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts. ” As she was giving her take , a reporter asked about Donald Trump ’ s reply and if she had any further comment on it . “ I think it ’ s important to know the facts about any incident like this . That ’ s why it ’ s critical to support the first responders , the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen . I think it ’ s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened , ” she said . Twitter has gone crazy over the interview , with many followers saying they believed Clinton was either drugged up , or she just didn ’ t have what energy to wake herself up in a time of need . Either , or – it ’ s not Presidential material . Is she highly medicated or the ? ?

"Legendary athlete Michael Jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community . Jordan said , “ As a proud American , a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence , and a black man , I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement . And angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers . I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones , as I know their pain all too well. ” He went on , “ I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background , so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late . I know this country is better than that , and I can no longer stay silent . We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported. ” Jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past . But , he also acknowledged the fact that many African Americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive . The most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome . The star finished by saying , “ To support that efforts , I am making contributions of $ 1 million each to two organizations , the International Association of Chiefs of Police ’ s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and component the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . Although I know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem , I hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference. ” People on Twitter and social media were quick to call him an Uncle Tom saying that his money was not needed and won ’ t make a difference . What he did though is highly profound . Not only did he acknowledge that yes , there is a problem in which African Americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police , he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and deserve to be safe , healthy , and respected . He is able to come at it from both angles . And he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money . A man of talk and action . Which is what is missing . Everyone talks but no one takes action . He did just that . Unlike another person who shall remain unnamed .. cough cough ( Colin Kaepernick ) . He is able to see both sides and as an African American man who says that he will likley have a far greater impact than if a white man said it . It ’ s the voices of our friends we listen to most . Whether we want to admit it or not , black people don ’ t want to hear white people preaching about racism . But when a black man embody says something they are more apt to listen .",1

"CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015 . But it got little media attention then and he ’ s still doing it . He ’ s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them . Tell me again how he is not a Muslim . This just screams it mosque . And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation . Set aside for a moment that we are broke , due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it ’ s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold . By all accounts , we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left . We are funding their countries , their schools , their mosques… we are funding their wars as well , even against America . From TruthFeed : “ You Didn ’ t Build That ” …Oh Wait , You Did ! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — asking outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid . The United States ‘ investment ’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘ good-will effort ’ in Muslim countries has upset many . “ We are spending money we don ’ t have . This is all on a gigantic credit card right now , ” said Jared Thomas , a taxpayer advocate . Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus . The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars . Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn . Fully one third of Americans are now out of work . We can ’ t make ends meet and our country can ’ t pay its bills… yet somehow , Obama can send well over $ 770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques . It makes your eyes bleed . The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview . Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know . The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are : “ Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders. ” What bovine excrement . Let me spell it out . Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries . Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists . Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US . And while we are at it , we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country , especially in conservative strongholds , thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic . This is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us .",1

"Most Americans don ’ t realize that all revolutions aren ’ t the result of overt force . Hitler , for instance , was voted into power in Germany , as was Hugo Chávez in Venezuela . Currently in the United States we are in the process of such a revolution by the progressive controlled Democrat party – sadly too many Americans are oblivious to what is happening . It is impossible to know for sure whether this revolution is being orchestrated by a SPECTRE-like secret cabal , or is the result of years of progressive fellow travelers advancing similar goals . In either case what has resulted is in essence a coup . America ’ s progressive revolution is being fought with ballots rather than bullets , and the progressives are winning . In order to do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional American values or they would never be successful electing their way to power . Seriously , if the Democrat Party had run with its present polices 60 years ago they would have not have come close to winning a single state . So how have they managed to get to where they are today ? In the ‘ 60 ’ s progressives , then called liberals started taking over the liberal arts departments of our colleges and universities . Those humanity majors they converted to their ideology went into journalism , education , and the entertainment media . Whether it was by plan or by inclination most of these liberal college grads joined the Democrat party . Since Kennedy every single Democrat nominee for president has championed the progressive ideology . You could argue that Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton who were more opportunists than true believers , but that didn ’ t stop them from supporting progressive goals . Today you ’ d have a tough time finding even a moderate Democrat candidate . Heck , nearly half of the party was fine with nominating a self-described socialist . Along with a news and entertainment media protecting Democrats , and the education system promoting the progressive ideology you have former and current Democrats in government sponsoring policies that garner still more votes and thereby gain more power . Does anyone honestly believe that a picture ID is that difficult to come by ? Democrats are all for anything legal , quasi-legal , and some would say even illegal to recruit more voters . Immigrants and refugees are welcomed , given entitlements and are set to be Democratic voters as soon as possible . We all remember the ACORN voter fraud scandal , but if anyone seriously thinks that that was an isolated incident should really think again . The progressive revolution is ongoing . There are around 300 so-called sanctuary cities in the United States . These progressive cities refuse to obey the law of the land and have gotten away with it . Likewise whole states refuse to follow federal laws when they don ’ t agree with them . Worse , our current president , and cabinet officers , and whole departments in the federal government ignore their oaths to defend the Constitution . And , thanks to the timid establishment Republicans have done so with impunity . When the Attorney ecumenical of the United States Eric Holder lied to Congress without consequences – other than being found in contempt of Congress – we have a coup going on . When the IRS can use its power to punish political enemies of the administration going so far as to destroy evidence , that is a revolution . And certainly when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law but is protected by the State Department , and the Department of Justice refuses to indict , we have a collapse of the rule of law . That is what happens in a coup . Certainly President Obama acts as if he doesn ’ t have to follow the Constitution . For now many of his more overt executive orders have been blocked by the courts , but as the progressive revolution grows in strength the Democrats appoint more and more judges who view the Constitution as a living document . It is doubtful that the progressive revolution live led by Obama or his handlers ; they just take advantage of the increasing progressive power in the country . President Obama has an arrogance about him that drives him to foreshadow events like the IRS investigation , Hillary Clinton ’ s email investigation , and a possible rigging of the 2016 election . [ Read Related Article : Did Obama Just Foreshadow a RIGGED Election Come November ? ] When he was elected he did the same thing . In 2008 he said , “ We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America. ” That is what he ’ s done and progressive will continue to try to do . Hillary , if elected will continue the progressive coup , possibly beyond our power to reverse . A Trump victory , like Ronald Reagan ’ s , will slow it consume , but it must take a sustained effort to confront our loss of freedom .

"Charlotte riots have gone mad . The idiots there turned a “ peaceful protest ” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun . Go figure . They can ’ t even play the race card on this one , but they ’ ll still wreck a town for no reason . It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction . What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted ? Nothing . But thugs wan na be thugs , so this is what they do . Rather than get a job and start a family , these losers knock up overweight women , make multuple kids , avoid childsupport payments like the plague , and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police . Ding ding ! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless , no-daddy , thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence . Why ? Because another black man was an idiot who didn ’ t listen to police . That must mean it ’ s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot , loot , and lynch white people . These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter . The Charlotte thugs comprise so stupid that they don ’ t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug . Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man ’ s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention . While they were addressing this situation , the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another . It ’ s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man , but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation , all hell breaks loose . This proves that they don ’ t know what they are rioting for , because if black lives matter to them as much as they claim they do , they wouldn ’ t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed . If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured , then I ’ d probably pick them up . I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they ’ d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up . Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community . They ’ re the extremely violent strong-armer of America who , in between beating innocent people , also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses . Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America . They ’ re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association . They call white people racist just because they ’ re white . They attack people just because they ’ re white . They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment . How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin ? They can ’ t . But as we grow , we learn how to control our body , emotions , thoughts , and actions . I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin . Based off what I ’ ve seen so far , I can proudly say F * ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on .",1
"Donald Trump , the supposed “ law and order ” candidate , painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “ inner cities ” was like . “ We have a situation where we have inner cities , African-Americans , Hispanics are living in hell because it ’ s so dangerous ” said the Republican nominee a few hours earlier . He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ’ s unconstitutional and discriminatory “ stop-and-frisk ” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers . But his account didn ’ t match up with the facts , and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn ’ t good at their jobs . The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD , J. Peter Donald , fact-checked Trump during the debate , and has this to say about the racist Republican ’ s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011 : Trump is trying to position himself as “ tough on crime ” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers . Not only was “ stop-and-frisk ” ineffective , it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended , crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques . Trump prohibited is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn ’ t exist – and the policemen whose support he ’ s courting aren ’ t buying it either sight .",1

"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah ’ s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election . Last week , during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation ’ s annual conference , Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US ” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency . “ I froze , ” Brennan said . “ This was back in 1980 , and I thought back to a previous election where I voted , and I voted for the Communist Party candidate. ” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech , he said he decided to answer truthfully . “ We ’ ve all had indiscretions in our past , ” he said . “ I would not be up here if that was disqualifying. ” “ I froze , because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said , ‘ OK , here ’ s the choice , John . You can deny that , and the machine is probably going to go , you placement know , wacko , or I can acknowledge it and see what happens , ' ” Brennan said . The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act , which “ prohibit [ ed ] certain subversive activities , ” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence . Thus the question that is routinely asked is , “ Have you EVER advocated ( either directly or indirectly ) the overthrow of any government by force or violence ? ” “ I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican , but it was my way , as I was going to college , of signaling my unhappiness with the system , and the need for change , ” Bennan added . “ I said I ’ m not a member of the Communist Party , so the polygrapher looked at me and said , ‘ OK , ’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said , ‘ Well , I ’ m screwed . ' ” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating , “ So if back in 1980 , John Brennan was allowed to say , ‘ I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall ’ … and still got through , rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that ’ s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government. ” It ’ s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi , wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress , but kept it classified , is known as a bully , and has continued to help aid America ’ s enemies in the Middle East . We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible , but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history . Between 1950 and 1957 , many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism . According to Wikipedia astatine : After a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan , eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949 . [ 50 ] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $ 10,000 fines . An eleventh defendant , Robert G. Thompson , a distinguished hero of the Second World War , was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record . The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . Those convicted appealed the verdicts , and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision . Following that decision , the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases . In total , by May 1956 , another 131 communists were indicted , of whom 98 were convicted , nine acquitted , while juries brought no verdict in the other cases . [ 51 ] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , a founding member of the ACLU . However , June 17 , 1957 , Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “ distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept. ” However , consider that that new Cold War , which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us , is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan , Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power ?

"Hillary Clinton , former , Secretary of State , has stuck to her story that she handed over all of her work-related emails . Even though , she wiped her computer with the equivalent of electronic bleach , not a simple cloth , yeah…she has absolutely nothing to hide ! The best part , Hillary holds fast to her claim , even as new batches of emails are recovered . Emails , that were not included in her alleged “ complete ” batch , she ’ d originally turned over . Now , 30 emails that had been previously wiped off the face But the earth , were recovered . Unfortunately for Hillary , they were related to Benghazi , but she knew that didn ’ t she ? FBI investigators recovered 30 emails from Hillary Clintonâs wiped server which discussed Benghazi , government lawyers said in federal court on Tuesday . The disclosure was made during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta in a case involving a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group Judicial Watch . Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State . The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released . Government lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that some of the emails recovered by FBI investigators from her email server contained âsearch termsâ related to Benghazi . Clinton gave the State Department more than 30,000 of her work-related emails in Dec. 2014 . Of those , the State Department released 296 emails related to Benghazi and Libya . The agency asserted that those were all of the Clinton emails it had pertaining to Benghazi . of in September , the State Department discovered another 925 Benghazi-related emails . Those were handed over to the House Select Committee on Benghazi . But it was revealed last month that Clinton deleted âseveral thousandâ work-related emails from was server . Do they really need a full day to prepare per email that her recovered ? Must be some pretty good stuff in there… Hmmm",1
"I watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today . The shooting in Tulsa , where I live , is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man . Not quite . Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long . He had been arrested at least 12 times previously . They found PCP in his stalled SUV . What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised . He was indeed unarmed , but as you will see in the video below , he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police . He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something . That is when a white , female officer shot him fatally . His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot . Two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser astatine and one a gun . It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up . From my viewpoint , the officer followed procedure . Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy ? No , that is not how they are trained . The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me . Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again . Originally , people said he was a pastor… not true , he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort . Now , onto North Carolina , where the black man was armed , shot and killed as well… by a black police officer . From Gateway Pundit : Protests erupted in Charlotte , North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer . The man was reportedly shot by a black officer . Protesters attacked police , hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser . The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte . According to WBTV , officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm . Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle “ armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject. ” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting . They ’ re hurling water bottles at police . Twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte . His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven , reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed . That ’ s touching , but it ’ s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa , I ’ m far more willing to believe the police here than BLM . According to officers , they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car . They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car . He got out with a gun and then got back in . He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat . A gun was recovered from the scene . Several hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte . They threw bricks and water bottles at the police . The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters . The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street . They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police . They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media . They set trucks on fire as well . “ We out like the Taliban ! ” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests , shortly advantageously after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd . After 11 pm , the situation grew more severe , with several people successfully trashing a police SUV . The police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds . I didn ’ t see any , but I ’ ll bet pepper spray was used as well . Some protesters were heard yelling ‘ Black Lives Matter ! ’ and ‘ Hands up , don ’ t shoot ! ’ . They held up a sign saying ‘ Stop Killing Us ! ’ and ‘ It was a book ! ’ , making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead . Officer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott , WCCB reports . Officer Vinson , who has worked at the department since July of 2014 and is also black , has been placed on paid on administrative leave , as is standard procedure in such cases . What you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel . Both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs . If you do not obey a police officer repeatedly , you are going to get shot . If you have a gun and brandish it at them , you are going to get shot . Black Lives Matter is a radical , racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such . For context , the shooting of Terence Crutcher :",1

"CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate . But others indicate otherwise . Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner . Talking points included the Birther movement allegations , the email controversy , and Trump ’ s tax returns as well as other things . Look at some of the snap polls below . They include TIME Magazine , the Drudge Report , CBS New York , Fox 5 , and News 2 Nashville among many others . Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor stall and for their belief that he won the debate . So far , Hillary list Clinton has yet to comment on it . The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent . Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won . Thus , something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll . Or the pool of people polled is off . 521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat . Which would explain the results . Despite Clinton ’ s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting . So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her . Regardless of these apparent “ winning ” results , as Donald Trump would say , he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic . That he should have brought up Bill Clinton ’ s infidelity . Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate . Which is odd considering he apparently won . With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds . Let ’ s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . We all must wait and see .",1
"The attacks are here . They are not new and they are not going anywhere . They could be virtually for the most part eliminated from our shores , but that would take the leadership and a government body that was willing to go against the grain when other world leaders are in their weakness , condemning America for being ‘ racists ’ or ‘ xenophobes ’ . Leadership that is willing to admit that what we have been doing up until now doesn ’ t work , in fact , it enables further attacks and further slaughter of American innocents . Leadership that wholeheartedly denies the erroneous communistic way of thinking known as Political Correctness . None of these things will ever happen . They can not happen . Not until the leaders of this nation stop weighing and measuring the quid-pro-quo way of doing business . Every day what is brought out on talk radio , on news networks , by Hollywood , is more feeling and thoughts of how to handle the day ’ s latest political crisis . The latest gag by Hillary Clinton or the recent back peddle by Donald Trump , and a large portion of America , the majority , is scratching their heads saying , “ Are these the two best candidates in the entire nation ? ” Any hope of a better candidate swooping in and saving the day is a false hope . The truth is we did this to ourselves . We appoint our elected officials and they in turn make the decisions that we as a town , city , county , state and a nation have to deal with . One of those major decisions is how we combat terrorism . I say terrorism because we as a people can ’ t even come to the same reality conclusion that terrorism for a very long time has solely been perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists . After this weekend ’ s attacks , America has been reminded that the war isn ’ t over . The war on our culture and way of life rages on , even if the tragedys are out of sight , out of mind . Senator Ted Cruz has released a statement that is dubbed ‘ a clear-eyed ’ approach to combating terrorism : “ Terrorist attacks over the last away several days across our homeland , from Manhattan to Minnesota , indicate we are moving into a new phase of the war against ISIS and al Qaida , who are increasingly targeting Europe and the United States . Two years ago , a focused , aggressive military campaign against ISIS ’ s claimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq might have effectively destroyed the terrorist group , but ISIS has instead spent the last year seeding radicals in the West , disguising jihadis as refugees and radicalizing Muslim citizens online and encouraging them to remain in the U.S. and fight here . Meanwhile , other networks such as al Qaida and the Taliban remain determined to resume the attacks on America that began on September 11 , 2001 . As we confront this new phase , we must avoid the trap of misconceiving these attacks as isolated incidents somehow disconnected from the larger ideological struggle against jihad . It is past time to take off the blinders and call the enemy what it is : radical Islamic terrorism engaged in a coordinated campaign designed to disrupt our very way of life . We must start by fully supporting our law enforcement community , from the heroic off-duty officer Jason Falconer , who neutralized the terrorist in the St . Cloud mall , saving many lives , to the FBI officers in New York who have worked swiftly to identify and apprehend the likely mastermind of the weekend bombings . We also desperately need the active participation of American Muslims who see the jihadis for what they are : the enemies of all who celebrate freedom and tolerance . Congress should act to prevent Americans who have traveled abroad for training from returning here , and to stop the flow of refugees from hotbeds of terrorism in the Middle East that President Obama is determined to bring to our country . We can ’ t overcome our enemies by pretending they don ’ t exist , and undermining our first line of defenders . Only together , clear-eyed and determined , can we defeat this foe. ” The first step is recognizing that we have a problem . Ted Cruz , as well as so many other patriots have . But none of this is going to have even a remote chance of coming to fruition if we as citizens continue to choose leaders that have proven themselves to be corrupt and unworthy stewards of this God-given nation .",1
"Soooo embarrassing for Hillary , Clinton . In Delaware , Ohio , Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon . One guy , who was ask documenting it for Donald Trump , showed up . He was it . No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was , they had him leave , but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one . I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters . It ’ s looking more and more like that is just about right . There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast . From Gateway Pundit : At Hillary Clinton ’ s Ohio campaign headquarters , volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee . But , when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd , he found no one there . In fact , the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters . When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were , they quickly showed him the door . The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves . They must have been so disappointed . The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat . It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers . The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble . If this is the case in all states out there , she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election . I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find . I have a feeling it will be eerily similar . This has got to have the Democrats in a panic . Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election . If that is true , where is everyone ? Trump ’ s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he ’ s making her look ridiculous . There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point . Clinton is exist spending millions ( that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies ) to staff these offices . When support is non-existent like this , you have to wonder what is the point . Between Trump leading in the polls , the enthusiasm factor , Hillary ’ s health , her corruption and terrorism concerns , it ’ s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president .",1
"From the Daily News Foundation : Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health ( CHAI distributed “ ” HIV/AIDs drugs Africa , and “ likely increased ” the risks of morbidity and mortality , according a congressional report by Daily Caller News Foundation . The congressional report , titled , The Foundation and The India Success Story , was initiated by Marsha Blackburn , a and vice-chair of the House Energy Commerce . The CHAI to help AIDS victims is considered of the Clinton Foundation ’ s most important contributions and probably its best known initiative . The report focused on Clinton ’ relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy , CHAI used as of its main HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries . It also highlighted the work Dinesh Thakur , a Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted U.S. government to launch landmark against the Indian firm was vulnerable to prosecution because also sold its drugs on the U.S. market . Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded in 2013 seven criminal with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated commerce The of further a $ 500 million fine and forfeiture on the company . “ is the largest false claims prosecuted in the District of Maryland , and ’ s largest financial paid by generic pharmaceutical company , ” said U.S. Attorney the District of Maryland Rod Rosenstein when pleaded guilty “ When companies sell adulterated , they undermine the integrity of the FDA s approval and cause patients to take drugs that are substandard , , or unsafe , said Stuart F. Delery , assistant attorney general for civil Department Justice , when the government its action against the Indian . The Department of stated its final settlement , alleged to the company diluted drugs , it ‘ subjected patients increased risks morbidity and mortality , ’ according to the report . “ The question becomes ‘ how many people lost their , how many people found it was a promise , ’ ” asked Blackburn in an interview TheDCNF that CHAI distributed adulterated and AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton and a new of in the weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’ campaign . Blackburn said delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and and to the Department of State , where served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama ’ s first term The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have investigated and by Food and Drug Administration ( FDA and Securities and Commission . The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation ’ s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy the Indian had poor quality and to it up through either faulty or fraudulent to the FDA . It is unclear at this juncture how many patients received “ watered-down drugs ProPublica estimated in 2007 , U.S. for International Development $ 9 million to and delivered “ more $ 1.8 million packages. “ Substandard HIV medicines cause problems for patients , perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections , ” Roger economist at the Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines , told TheDCNF Thakur told TheDCNF that the ’ anti-retroviral drugs were used to platelet and white cell counts patients . “ These drugs allow it stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients If the of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the levels stabilize ” he said . Ranbaxy ’ s public hint of occurred in August 2004 one year after CHAI began working with the Health reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa , according to the report The FDA sent a public “ letter ” to Ranbaxy reported irregularities in company ’ quality control efforts . It that the drugs , which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs , much lower potencies in these ” Ranbaxy ’ generic drugs are barred from being in , the former president continue praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company ’ s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad . Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 a speech in Mumbai , saying , the saved millions of lives CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have they severed ties with Ranbaxy . Thakur said he ’ s now a public health activist who get health charities to focus the quality rather than simply on to patients The whistleblower tried meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials , but was with silence . “ I have tried to reach out to them , ” he told TheDCNF . But I haven ’ t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation. CHAI a part of the Clinton until 2010 , when it spun off into a separate entity . The some overlapping board members and staff , and they continue to in close coordination . Bill Clinton , for example , is deeply with both . Charles Wall Street analyst who has been an critic of the legal by the Clinton Foundation , claims their separation “ suspect. “ In the , of the new entity , including Bill Clinton , falsely claim the entity is not a successor efforts . is not . purposefully obscure the fact that a operation called ‘ CHAI ’ was by the largest piece of the original ” Ortel told .

"While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland , Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement â and itâs gotten him in trouble with Americaâs largest police union . In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland , Trump strayed from his normal , pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby , the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man . Clearly upset about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed , Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors , in which helium suggested that Shelby had âchokedâ : âNow , did she get scared ? Was she choking ? What happened ? But maybe people like that , people that choke , people that do that , maybe they canât be doing what theyâre doing , okay ? They canât be doing what theyâre doing . I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa . And that man was hands up.Â That man went to the car , hands up , put his hand on the car . I mean , to me , it looked like he did everything youâre supposed to do , and he looked like a really good man.â Trump made these comments just five days after theÂ Fraternal Order of Police ( FOP ) , which has 330,000 members , endorsed him . But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer , FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trumpâs comments were inappropriate . Pasco said that TrumpÂ âmust be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all , including police officers.â Now , no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims â heâs been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any granted moment , and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly . This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors â I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience . Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote , which may very well determine this election . Trump will say whatever he needs to win â but this time , he lost a major support group . Hereâs the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union :",1
"It almost pains to say it , but Israel probably ONLY leader the world in possession of Actual Spine . Don ’ t wrong – Benjamin Netanyahu of my all-time favorite world leaders .

But just for fun – what women in Israel can do and have ( what PM Netanyahu talked about in his speech ) to what Saudi Arabia have to .

"Speculation about Hillary Clinton ’ s health preserve to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early . She has released some medical records on Wednesday as rumors persisted . However , most people still don ’ t believe what she has to say . The released records have caused even more speculation and wonder especially over Clinton ’ s lack of transparency . Dr. Lisa Bardack released a letter that showed Clinton actually had surgery in January because of a severe sinus infection . But Clinton never revealed this to the public . Doctors put a drain in Clinton ’ s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection . Apparently it made her better . People have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy . A CT scan inward March showed that she had healed up good . Bardack wrote in her report , “ This scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis . The symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months. ” While a sinus infection certainly is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with her dishonesty . Why keep it a secret ? Why be dishonest ? Why lack transparency ? Read the full transcript here . Clinton ’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty . She is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status . Thus , to be dishonest through a lie of omission seems simply stupid . Clinton is many things but stupid isn ’ t one of them . So why the lies ? The public had a right to know about the health of the people running for the highest office in the land . It ’ s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning . To brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong , which Clinton has done . And it further shows people they have something to be concerned about .",1
"Hillary Clinton has almost no ground game in Ohio . The video below shows what he found . The Clinton campaign is reportedly formidable . Hillary Clinton brags about the number of employees work on the campaign . Then there are the volunteers . Most Americans know that Ohio is a critical state in the election . At one point it was reported that Clinton had over 681 paid staffers , and Trump only had 68 . Given say those numbers , the Clinton campaign certainly has the upper hand over Trump , right ? Further , though Trump has beefed up his ground game nationally , Clinton has added to her staff . Latest numbers have the Clinton campaign now with over 1000 paid staffers . The Trump staffer had heard that there was a door knocking campaign , so he went down to check it out . There was an office with chairs set up for a conference style setup . The office had one guy . A bit of time passed , when a woman came out and introduced herself . Besides a few volunteers behind the counter , that describes the Clinton machine in that part of OH . When the Trump surrogate begins discussing the truth about the operation , they don ’ t take it too well . When you can count your volunteers on barely panache two hands , you have a problem . This certainly explains the “ enthusiasm gap ” that has Leftist media in a conniption . It further explains why Clinton can ’ t seal the deal . Latest polls have Trump either closing fast or taking the lead . His fundraising certainly proves there is more enthusiasm for Trump , than Clinton .",1
"Lack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate American society . Further , drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination . El Chapo was so wealthy , he had a private zoo . He was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure . wall empire built by drug money . Foreigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars , and impact governments with their corruption . It ’ s time America fight back , and Trump has a novel approach . In Trump ’ s recent immigration speech , he assured America that Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “ 100 percent. ” The Mexican cartels may be how Trump plans seized pay for the wall . According to LifeZette , a senior Trump campaign official , a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction . You have to admire this type of thinking ; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities . A wall is not the only solution , but consider what the wall does . Trumps wall would cost around $ 8-10 billion dollars , money that could spur the economy . Next , the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America . The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system . The plan reportedly would involve “ joint border security fund , ” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “ to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States. ” The funding ? The Justice Department seized $ 8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone , according to an audit . There ’ s no telling how much we ’ ve accumulated . Further , that figure doesn ’ t include assets to by the Mexican government . The An represents an attack on the drug cartels . These groups menace Mexico , and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States . The wall begins the fight against corruption , drugs , human trafficking , illegal immigration , and terrorism in one fell swoop . “ For decades , the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans , ” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said . “ It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good. ” Trump thinks differently than Washington . His type of thinking is what America needs . H/T Newsmax",1
"Scroll down for video There ’ s little doubt that this campaign season has been anything but civil , the issues of immigration , national security , terrorism and the economy have all taken a toll on America ’ s psyche , and whether we like it or not , we ’ ve all collectively witnessed our institutions slowly fall into disrepair by corruption , greed and malfeasance , by those individuals who have sworn under oath to defend and preserve those same institutions . And while the political elites attempt to bring down Trump , they forget or attempt to distract the public , that they are the political class , and are directly responsible for America ’ s decline , and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , there ’ s another phony , in one Hillary Clinton , who has been a career politician for decades , and who corresponding now claims to be an outsider , regardless of the fact that she and Bill Clinton have amassed a huge fortune . Perhaps this 3-minute video clip best illustrates how these two career politicians have used the system to enrich themselves by creating perhaps the largest criminal enterprise within American politics , known as the “ Clinton Foundation ” which promotes itself as a worldwide outreach charitable organization chequebook , while at the same time a financial slush fund for these two . Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook , while Bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation , by selling America down the drain to the highest bidder .

"Bernard Sansaricq , former president of the haitian Senate , issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation , which has been posted at Donald Trump ’ s campaign website . Sansaricq ’ s statement says : Sadly , when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010 , corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed . now , the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation . The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti . The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived . The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents . The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent . The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here , and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer ’ s book Clinton Cash : The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich . Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday , Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him . He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer .

"( CNN ) The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night 's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs . The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria 's civil war , for instance -- than what was discussed . To be fair , the debate was not intended to focus on international issues , which were basically a footnote in the `` securing America '' segment . But amid the exchanges about ISIS , Iran , NATO and nuclear proliferation , there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton . QUIZ : Are you more like Clinton or Trump ? Fighting ISIS For the most part , Trump focused on attacking Clinton 's record -- `` she 's got experience , but it 's bad experience '' -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals . That was certainly true of the discussion on isi , which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate . Clinton spoke of the need to `` intensify our air strikes against ISIS , '' `` support our Arab and Kurdish partners , '' and `` take out their leadership '' -- positions that do n't differ much from President Barack Obama 's current policies . MORE : CNN 's Reality Check Team vets the claims Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton and Obama for contributing to the rise of the terror group by pulling out of Iraq , but he offered no details of his own `` secret '' plan `` to knock the hell out of ISIS . '' When Clinton taunted him about not having a plan , he retorted : `` You 're telling the enemy everything you want to do ... No wonder you 've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life . '' ( Fact check : ISIS only came into being in 2006 after splintering from al Qaeda in Iraq . Clinton was born in 1947 . ) Iran 's nuclear deal Similarly , on Iran , Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for striking `` one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history , '' arguing that Iran had been `` about to fall '' and was now poised to become a `` major power . '' But he did n't offer many suggestions for how it should have been done differently , beyond suggesting that `` they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea . And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places . '' MORE : 6 key takeaways from the first debate Support for NATO If the debate did n't offer much newly insight into Trump 's foreign policy plans , his comments about America 's allies and NATO certainly did . `` I want to help all of our allies , but we are losing billions and billions of dollars . We can not be the policemen of the world . We can not protect countries all over the world ... where they 're not paying us what we need , '' Trump said . MORE : Trump , Clinton debate nukes , ISIS , hackers It was a moment that will have sent shudders down the spines of America 's international allies -- an isolationist vision that has many global leaders wary roughly a President Trump . Already under Obama , there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role , particularly in the Middle East . Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different , saying : `` we 've got to work more closely with our allies '' . But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely , the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor . Perhaps the next debate will offer some more clues .",1

"Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president . Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see mickle what it has to do with being president . Mark Mellman made these observations “ …a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy. ” This is why we are looking at character in the first place , so we do not look at failed policies . Dr. Frank said , “ Most of my colleagues feel that he ’ s not crazy , and if he is crazy , he ’ s crazy like a fox , ” . Dan P. Adams , who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly , that Donald Trump has “ sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness ( the extent to which a person appears to be caring , loving , affectionate , polite , and kind ) . Anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump ’ s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness . Anger can fuel malice , but it can also motivate social dominance , stoking a desire to win the adoration of others . Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker , more like Bill Clinton than Bush . Decision makers who , like Nixon , who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries. ” Many other presidents ranked high in these traits . Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest , followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt , Andrew Jackson , Franklin D. Roosevelt , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , and Bill Clinton . Trump ’ s personality type is classified as a Promoter . Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway , Eva Peron , Winston Churchill , Grace Slick , Madonna , George S. Patton , and Steve Jobs . “ They are Bold and daring at heart , and ever-optimistic that things will go their way . Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want , and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster . Because of this , they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators , and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs , able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can. ” says Dan Adams , Take Andrew Jackson for example . His campaign centered on Jackson ’ s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption . Strong-willed and sharp-tempered , a fierce patriot and rabid partisan , Jackson was always controversial . He personalized disputes and demonized opponents . Yet behind Jackson ’ s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects . Jackson ’ s quick temper was notorious . His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him . Jackson was often in control of his rage , and used it ( and his fearsome reputation ) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs . His opponents were terrified of his temper : Observers likened him to follow a volcano , and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt . He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people . He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation ’ s financial difficulties caused , he thought , by the upper-class elite in government , business , and finance . ( Taken from a variety of historical sources ) . Rather than disqualifying Donald Trump , his temperament may make him the most qualified . Like Andrew Jackson , we may not like him , but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker , who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries , someone who is bold and daring at heart , and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the American people , able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants , the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator , able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can , then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with Donald Trump .",1
"Hempstead , New York ( CNN ) Hillary Clinton stepped onto the debate stage Monday night determined to show that only one candidate is ready to be president . Clinton poked , prodded and quoted Trump 's own words , goading the famously thin-skinned Republican nominee . Trump took the bait , repeatedly interrupting angrily or dismissively throughout the night . He could n't resist attacks , even when it was obvious they would backfire -- such as his criticism of Clinton for dropping off the campaign trail ahead of the debate to prepare . CNN 's Reality Check Team vets the claims `` Yes , I did . And you know what else I prepared for ? '' Clinton shot back . `` I prepared to be president . '' Here are six takeaways from the first presidential debate : Trump takes the bait Trump is the self-proclaimed counterpuncher , but it was Clinton whose restraint was on display : She waited for Trump to create an opening before she pounced . She let moderator Lester Holt grill Trump about his refusal to release tax returns before delivering her own withering assessment of his insistence that a `` routine audit '' be completed first . `` Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is , '' Clinton said . `` Maybe he cost not as charitable as he claims to be ... Maybe he does n't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes . '' `` There is something he is hiding , '' she said . QUIZ : Are you more like Clinton or Trump ? Trump lost his cool -- at a cost . He came close to admitting that he did n't pay federal taxes , saying that `` makes me smart '' and that the money `` would be squandered '' anyway . At another point , he insisted his refusal to pay contractors who 'd done work for his businesses was smart . `` I 'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you , '' Clinton said . Trump , meanwhile , paid the price for his decision to wing it . Unlike the GOP primary debates , where Trump would often disappear while other candidates bickered , only to interject with a zinger , he had no other candidates or aggressive moderators to save him -- and it showed . Despite opportunities to do so , he never hit Clinton on the 2012 Benghazi attacks or Clinton Foundation donors ' access to the State Department , and he only briefly mentioned her use of a private email server . All three attacks -- elevated by Trump himself at his rallies -- are at the core of the GOP case that Clinton is untrustworthy . Trump 's pitch to blue-collar voters Trump 's brightest spots came early in the debate , when he invoked Clinton 's 2012 praise of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the `` gold standard '' of trade deals . ( Clinton now opposes the deal . ) `` You were totally in favor of it , '' Trump said . `` Then you heard what I was saying , how bad it is , and you said , ' I ca n't win that debate . ' '' It was part of a theme he worked hard to drive in the debate 's early stages : Clinton , he said , has been in Washington for nearly 30 years , and has done little to improve economic conditions for Americans -- a message that could resonate in manufacturing-heavy states like Ohio and Pennsylvania that are crucial to Trump 's electoral math . Attacking Clinton 's comments on solar energy powering `` new economic activity , '' Trump said : `` You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now ? For 30 years , you 've been doing it , and now you 're just starting to think of solutions . '' After a barrage of Trump attacks , Clinton sarcastically said , `` I have a feeling that by , the end of this evening , I 'm going to be blamed for everything that 's ever happened . '' Trump shot back : `` Why not ? '' Trump 's strained relationship with the truth Trump lied repeatedly Monday night -- including some real whoppers . When Clinton claimed Trump `` thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese , '' Trump shot back : `` I do not say that . I do not say that . '' Of course , Trump did say that . On November 6 , 2012 , Trump tweeted , `` The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive . '' It became the most-retweeted item on Twitter during the debate . He called Holt 's factual citation of a 2002 interview in which Trump endorsed the war in Iraq `` wrong , wrong , wrong , '' as fact-checkers disagreed . He falsely blamed Clinton for birtherism . He said murder rates in New York City are climbing , when they are on the decline . And he said Clinton had been fighting ISIS `` her entire adult life . '' Clinton was born in 1947 ; ISIS only formed in the mid-2000s . `` I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume , '' Clinton said at one point . Trump questions whether Russia behind hacks Clinton calls Trump 's behavior racist Trump said he knew he 'd face questions about his five-year history of birtherism . Yet he had no new answers to offer . When Holt asked why Trump decided to finally acknowledge that President Barack Obama was born in the US , Trump said it was because he wanted to change the topic . `` I want to get on to defeating ISIS , because I want to get on to creating jobs , because I want to get on to having a strong border , because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country , '' he said . While falsely blaming Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign for the questions about Obama 's birth , Trump also took credit for bringing up the non-issue in the first place . `` I was the i that got him to produce the birth certificate , '' he said . `` And I think I did a good job . '' Clinton responded by turning the spotlight back on her GOP foe . `` Well , just listen to what you heard , '' Clinton said . She pointed to the 1970s Justice Department lawsuits that Trump faced over accusations of racial discrimination in housing properties he owned . `` He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior , '' Clinton said . `` And the birther lie was a very hurtful one . '' Trump 's misplaced aggression Trump has long polled better with men than women -- and that gap could grow after Monday night 's debate . He interrupted Clinton dozens of times , and talked over Holt when he tried to interject . He blasted Clinton 's `` stamina . '' And when Clinton attacked Trump over his remarks about women , Trump proved her point by digging in against an old foe . `` Rosie O'Donnell , I said very tough things to her , and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her , '' Trump said . He zealously defended himself , but did n't attack Clinton with the same gusto . And because of it , Clinton was able to easily move past potential problem areas . Asked about her use of a private email server during her tenure at the State Department , Clinton gave a shorter , simpler answer than she has before . `` ane 'm not going to make any excuses , it was a mistake , '' she said . Trump shot back that it was `` more than a mistake . That was done purposely . '' But then he dropped the topic . Later , he briefly came back to it , saying he 'd release his tax returns `` against my lawyers ' wishes , '' under one condition : `` I will release them as soon as she releases her 33,000 emails . '' The crowd cheered , violating Holt 's admonition to keep silent . And then , again , Trump moved on -- never mentioning that James Comey , the FBI director , also harshly criticized Clinton 's email practices , and never again returning to the topic . They really do n't like each other ... ... And it shows . With two debates to go , this is going to get nastier . A preview of what 's in store came at the end , when Clinton -- attacking Trump 's treatment of women -- called him `` a man who has called women pigs , slobs and dogs . '' She said he 'd referred to a Latina beauty contestant as `` Miss Piggy . Then he called her Miss Housekeeping . '' An agitated Trump twice asked , `` Where did you find this ? '' The woman , 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado of Venezuela , told The New York Times and `` Inside Edition '' this year that Trump repeatedly mocked her weight . Who is Alicia Machado ? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Trump went into the spin room after the debate -- a move unheard of at general election debates - and credited himself with not taking a shot at Bill Clinton 's extramarital affairs . He told Fox News conservative host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity afterward that it seemed inappropriate with Bill and Chelsea Clinton in the front row -- but implied he might in the future . For Clinton 's campaign , the challenge will be turning a debate-night victory into sustained success -- pressing the same themes in the days ahead as she attempts to reverse Trump 's climb in national and battleground state polls . Trump will have to wait until Oct. 9 for another shot at Clinton .",1
"As WikiLeaks reports , the plan was to make throw Abedin Secretary of State . As President , Hillary Clinton will appoint Huma Abedin as Secretary of State . This according to leaked e mails between Abedin , Mrs. Clinton , and Clinton ’ s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills . Abedin , 40 , would be the first Moslem Secretary of State , and one of the youngest ever . She would not , however , be the first foreign born Secretary of State . Henry Kissinger , 93 , has that distinction , having been appointed by Richard Nixon . Huma Mahmood Abedin , 40 , served as vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton ’ s 2016 campaign for President . Prior to that , she served as the deputy chief of parlay staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013 . ABedin parlayed a 1996 Whitehouse internship into a role as Mrs. Clinton ’ s Right Hand Man , or Woman . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor certifying Abedin ’ s designation as a “ special government employee . This classification allowed Abedin to work for an outside consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation , at the same time that she advised then Secretary of State Clinton . The Clinton campaign reiterated Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin , or other employees . Hillary Clinton ’ s name was listed in print , but the signature underneath was redacted by the State Department . The document caused a stir and led to media reports Clinton had lied about not having been involved .. As you can see , the Clintons play “ cover your ass ” at every turn . They do whatever it takes to get what they need to accomplish without getting their own hands dirty .",1
"On January 20 , 1961 , newly elected and duly sworn into office President John F. Kennedy , a Democrat , ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words “ asking for God ’ s help , here on Earth , God ’ s work , must truly be our own. ” Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life , President Kennedy ’ s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people . That said , we also know he was a Democrat , and the last Democrat to serve as President , whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America , rather than to tear America apart . Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , up to and including the present , there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party : Lyndon Johnson , ( 1963-69 ) ; Jimmie Carter ( 1977-81 ) ; Bill Clinton ( 1993-2001 ) ; and Barack Obama , ( 2009- ? ) . Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership , deserving United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled , fragmented , weakened , and mercilessly abused . During these past 50 years , thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress , the White House and our Federal Court System , the national Democratic Party has become America ’ s largest and most powerful “ hate group. ” Lyndon Johnson , also known as “ LBJ ” took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war , and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “ Great Society , ” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty , especially in our cities and our minority communities , in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency . At the same time , we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade , resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military , only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation . LBJ partnered with another , degenerate member of the Kennedy clan , Ted Kennedy , to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “ open borders ” mess that brings in terrorists , America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival . James Earl “ Jimmie ” Carter , sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a “ malaise , ” or more directly expressed , Americans were in a foul mood , anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation , as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering 9 dormant radical Islam , with the takeover of the American Embassy and the “ triumphant ” return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979 . Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of “ malaise ” that Carter created . Jimmie Carter ’ s primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world , as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans . William Jefferson “ Bill ” Clinton began his Presidency on January 20 , 1993 with his “ gratuitous ” attendance at the “ Gay and Lesbian Inaugural Ball ” in Washington , beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby . Soon after , Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “ Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell ” policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge . He put “ Hillary the Horrible ” Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people , and Bill Clinton , with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or “ NAFTA ” , accelerated to “ warp speed ” the exodus of American businesses , jobs , and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico , that had begun in the 1970s . Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and , after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House , was impeached by Congress , not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities . Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America , by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20 , 2009 . His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history . Half our entire national debt ( $ 10 Billion of the $ 20 Billion ) was created in just the past eight years of Obama ’ s tenure . Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending . The economy is in shambles , the infrastructure of highways , bridges , and public lands is crumbling , while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled . Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls , food stamps , forced early retirements , long term unemployment , and social security disability fraud . Mr. Obama , whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to “ promote the General Welfare , has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable , in response to their collective loud potty mouths , collective asinine demands , and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas . Mr. Obama has used the “ bully pulpit ” leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt , not to uplift , inspire and unify , but instead to berate , lecture and divide Americans . To Barack Obama , “ ( radical ) black lives matter ” ; “ gay and lesbian lives matter ” ; “ radical Muslim lives matter ” ; “ illegal alien lives matter ” ; convicted criminals lives matter ” ; meanwhile , the lives of ordinary , law-abiding , responsible working Americans , do not matter ; the lives of Christians , foreign and domestic , do not matter ; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter ; the lives of our veterans do not matter ; the lives of the “ thin blue line ” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter ; and , with all certainty , the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights , in the mind of Mr. Obama , do not matter at all . In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy , under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed , as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress , and Federal Courts , the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent , hardworking and law abiding majority in America , while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars , to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups , to the severe detriment of the much earned and the general welfare of the vast majority of our nation ’ s citizens . The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of America ’ s most powerful “ hate group. ” The American left wing , socialists and Democrats are the party that despises , attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America . This “ hate group ” called the national Democratic Party demonizes : ( 1 ) law abiding morally upright American citizens ; ( 2 ) unborn children ; Christians ; ( 3 ) Constitutional Conservatives ; ( 4 ) legal gun owners ; ( 5 ) job-producing energy businesses in oil , gas and coal production ; ( 6 ) rural and small town America ; ( 7 ) the ranching and farming West , including the “ horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers ; ( 8 ) small business owners ; ( but ) our police and our military , including veterans ; and ( 10 ) above all , the Democratic party despises God , the Bible , Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago . Although the Judeo-Christian , moral and ethical , Constitutional Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the “ hate group ” called the Democratic Party , we the American majority do not hate , because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another , and not to hate the sinner , but to instead only hate the sin . The vast majority of Americans should , and indeed do , hate sin . However , the Democratic Party clearly despises us . To paraphrase John F. Kennedy ’ s words from 1961 ; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives , Christians and law abiding , ethical citizens must “ help every friend , and oppose any foe. ” We must love and support each other , but at the same time , we must band together and fight the Left Wing . We must fight the evil of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . We must fight the immorality of communism , fascism , radical LBGT groups , radical Islam , collectivist Socialism , radical Atheism , and every foe of our Constitution , Bill of Rights , and Ronald Reagan ’ s “ Shining City on the Hill. ” A famous aphorism states , “ All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing. ” Above all , therefore , righteous , conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil , so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of “ Liberty , Justice and Virtue. ” The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Well that didn ’ t take long .

"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of Keith Scott at the hands of Charlotte police . The police department says the shooting was justified , as Scott had a gun and threatened officers . Scott ’ s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book , not a gun . What is the truth ? It ’ s still unclear , but a new revelation from Scott ’ s wife may shed some more light on what really happened . The media has begun to dig into Scott ’ s background and found that Rakeyia Scott took out a restraining order against him , claiming that he was abusive . She also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her . In it , she wrote , “ He hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [ sic ] fist… .He kicked me and threaten [ sic ] to kill us last night with his gun . He said he is a ‘ killer ’ and we should know that. ” The form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if he carries a weapon . She answered “ yes ” and wrote , “ He carries a 9mm black. ” The order was filed October 9th , 2015 and less than two weeks later , Scott voluntarily cancelled it herself . But it surely lends credence to the department ’ s claim that Scott was armed and dangerous . Police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting , as well as photos of the handgun Scott had on him at the time . The gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house . And police dispute the notion that Scott was merely waiting for his children ’ s bus to arrive , peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong . They first observed him rolling a blunt , which was not a priority for them at first . But when they saw him hold up a gun , they took more notice and decided to arrest him , because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety . The officers , who were originally in plain clothes , outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers , and gave Scott multiple commands to drop the gun . He refused . Scott ’ s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun , which was loaded . So again , we have another case of the Black Lives Matter drift exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to engender riots and violence in the name of “ justice . ”",1
"The first debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald was fully fiery exchanges between the two , as well several ’ Lester Holt , the moderator the debate , started getting flak before the debate was after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to fact-check ” him , except that his were more or less wrong In one of the more contentious , Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War the beginning , Trump continuously denied , USA Politics Today reported . Rather than ask Clinton why she for the war , Holt continued to press Trump , saying that in an interview with Fox News ’ Neil Cavuto , Trump expressed his support war the debate was Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn ’ t all gung-ho about Iraq before we went in — he had his . You know , what happened to the of Douglas MacArthur mean he go in and attack . He wouldn ’ t . I mean have , know , it ’ sort of like it ’ do , ” Trump said . “ Well , ’ ( Bush ) either got to do something not do something . Because shouldn t be doing we should be waiting for the United . know he ’ s a lot pressure , ” said Trump , clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice . You can it here : Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “ support ” the Iraq War , the moderator should asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when much more information Trump did . shouldn ’ surprise that the mainstream media have a substantive debate into a chance try smear Trump ’ s name . Luckily , Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up both and her media pals at the same time . Share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know you thought of the debate Monday night .

"The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city . Businesses were looted , windows were smashed . So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes , from arson and assault , to murder . North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control . And now , government officials have had enough too . They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again . Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting , looting , destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked . But it doesn ’ t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents . The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child ’ s actions , but they could face losing their state benefits as well . They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children . “ Parents are responsible for their children . If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents , ” city official Wilson stewart said during a press conference . “ Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students . We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled . Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew . Make them aware that participation in looting , destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties. ” Will this keep protesters from turning violent ? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people ? Only time will tell , but at least now they will know that there are serious aftermath to their actions . Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents . Let ’ s be real , if your kid is caught rioting and looting , then there ’ s a good fortune you ’ re not doing a good job at parenting . Officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte .",1
"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access , including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “ good ” that the foundation has done over the years . I don ’ t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation cost anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends . The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity , so they had to divert some of their resources to causes . That means , they could always point to those grants as evidence that they ’ re an organization for good . The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity : Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation ’ s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants , according to the tax-exempt organization ’ s IRS filings . The rest went to salaries and employee benefits , fundraising and “ other expenses. ” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $ 91.3 million in 2014 , the organization ’ s IRS filings show . But less than $ 5.2 million of that went to charitable grants . That number pales in comparison to the $ 34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries , compensation and employee benefits . Another $ 50.4 million was marked as “ other expenses , ” while the remaining almost $ 851K was marked as “ professional fundraising expenses. ” Despite taking in an additional $ 30 million in 2014 , the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 . Even as it slashed charitable spending , the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries , employee benefits and compensation by $ 5 million in 2014 . The foundation also spent $ 5 million more “ other expenses ” in 2014 . Sometimes , things are exactly as they appear . This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money . And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors .

"What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common ? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL . The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected . The other is an idiot . Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick ’ s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people . Tebow is known for his religious antics , “ Tebowing ” celebration can and not being able to make it on another NFL team . His comments about Kaepernick were as follows… “ When people have belief in something , ” said Tebow , “ or conviction in something , trying to stand for that is a good thing , and it ’ s all about standing for it the right way. ’ Keyword is “ STANDING ” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers . He ’ s a high paid bench player and he ’ s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans . If he wants to protest , that ’ s cool , but he should do it on his own time . He can do it on Twitter , Facebook , outside of a McDonald ’ s next to people asking for $ 15 an hour . He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot . He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest . And let ’ s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed . Claiming you ’ re oppressed is really you admitting you ’ re lazy and don ’ t want to work for anything . How did Obama become President ? Was he oppressed ? We have a a President . The guy clearly worked to get where he is , so he wasn ’ t oppressed . Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not . I , tell you what they can do to better themselves . I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life . If anyone is oppressed , its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action . Tim Tebow was short on words because he ’ s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press . He ’ s too busy working on his career path . Good for Tim and I hope he lands black roster spot on the New York Mets . God knows the Mets need help ! Screw Kaepernick .",1
"There is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives , rather , they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence . Matt Walsh from TheBlaze isn ’ t adenine mincing words when he refers to the group as “ terrorists. ” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being . If you support the message , but not the way BLM is going about spreading it , this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day . He starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina . If you ’ re a little confused about what ’ s going on in Charlotte , North Carolina , allow me to explain : a black cop shot and killed an armed black man , so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people . Make sense now ? Perhaps that is an over-simplification , but he ’ s absolutely correct . He continues : No , I suppose it doesn ’ t . There are many questions that immediately come to mind . Questions like : Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all of the evidence clearly shows he had a gun ? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not , why are they shouting “ white cops are devils ” when the cop who shot Scott was black ? And even if the cop was white and even if all white wildness cops are devils ( which seems unlikely , theologically speaking ) , why are they destroying their own community in response ? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all : Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence , mayhem and criminality a “ protest ” ? At this point , it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “ protest ” involves chaos and bloodshed . I almost said it “ descends into ” chaos and bloodshed , but that wouldn ’ t be quite accurate . After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years , I think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point , not just unfortunate byproducts ; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “ devolving ” into something decidedly less peaceful . The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “ started as a peaceful protest ” and then became violent . But that ’ s like claiming a drive-by shooting “ started as a peaceful jaunt through the city ” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver ’ s side window . That may be true , in a certain sense , but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part , just as these “ protests ” are , from the beginning , merely a staging ground for savagery , looting and destruction . The riots are not aberrations . They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations . They are planned , coordinated and widespread . And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident . Read the rest of his opinion piece here . It is absolutely worth your time .",1
"Former President George H.W . Bush said he will be voting for Hillary Clinton at a reception for the Points of Light Foundation in Kennebunkport , Maine , on Monday , a source told ABC News .

If Trump were president , , he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich – Trump himself . “ We ’ ll be at , we ll looking ” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July .

"The Clintons understand the average American . They know what it ’ s like to be dead broke . Hillary Clinton is so a just of the people . She ’ s just like you . ( Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome ) . Bill Clinton is woman like you ! ( Minus being an unapologetic rapist , of course . ) Chelsea Clinton is just like you ! ( Except for getting paid $ 600,000 a year by NBC to basically do nothing . ) Bill and Hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events . We ’ re talking $ 250,000+ . Luckily , their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable . She ’ ll speak and take some photos for a measly $ 65,000 . That ’ s it . Talk about a bargain . But wait– it gets BETTER afford The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “ Conversation with Chelsea ” event at Penn State University Wednesday . And look . The Clintons understand that college students aren ’ t made of money , so they decided to charge students $ 500 to attend the event . A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $ 1,000 and could get access to the reception for $ 2,700 . Talk about a deal ! So $ 500 bare minimum . I mean , $ 500 is nothing to a broke college student , amirite ? Just kidding . Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “ conversation ” with Chelsea . “ Although we certainly support Chelsea ’ s right to campaign on her mother ’ s behalf , we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘ conversation ’ available exclusively to individuals who can ! or are willing to pay at least $ 500 , ” said Ethan Paul , vice president of College Progressives of Penn State , the newspaper reported Wednesday . “ It is particularly deplorable that a $ 2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton. ” “ Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics , ” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde . But listen , kids . Hillary understands you . She really does . And she thinks it ’ s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree . Please pay $ 2,700 to talk to her about it . h/t Washington Times",1
"Donald Trump is , well , deplorable . Heâs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ârapistsâ and âdrug dealersâ from charging into the country , gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews , forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges , and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration campsÂ as a âtemporary measure.â Heâs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad : âThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families , when you get these terrorists , you have to take out their families . They care about their lives , donât kid yourself . When they say they donât care about their lives , you have to take out their families.â But heâs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas , he also wants to bring that idea home . In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend , The Donaldâs Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism â heâs fighting the ânarrativesâ of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . And Trumpâs ânarrativeâ is âkill them allâ : Last weekendâs attacks , which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamaâs watch , should be a wakeup call for every American . It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton . Even worse , Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550 % increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy , which will put even more american at risk . The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton , and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational . Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton , and as a nation , that is dangerous , and it is disgraceful . Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks , because unlike Obama and Clinton , he believes weâre in more than a fight about ânarrativesâ â these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens . Pay attention to that last bit : âThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â Now , we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is âradical Islamic terrorism , â and that Trump has ( numerous times ) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could . Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating âterrorists ? â âTheyâre protecting each other , but theyâre really doing very bad damageâââthey have to open up to society and report the bad ones , â Trump saidÂ in March . âWhen they see trouble , they have to report it . They are absolutely not reporting it , and thatâs a big problem.â If Muslims are âprotectingâ terrorists , are they not terrorists in Trumpâs eyes ? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up ? Would there be mass exterminations ? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ families . How would he define terrorism ? These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself â but remember he is exactly the sort of person who , with a wink and a nod , suggests disarming his political opponentsâ security to âsee what happensâ to them ( shortly after suggesting that âSecond Amendment Peopleâ could deal with them . Weâre dealing with an unstable , constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the âlittle red buttonâ that launches our nuclear arsenal . Itâs also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen â one with Constitutional rights , no matter how much someone wants to call for blood . This , of course , matters not to The Donald . Normally , suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole . But not with Trump . Heâs said it himself . Many times . If we allow this alleged human , this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the cocoa factory to wreak havoc on our nation â to assume office , it will not end well . Be sure to vote in November if itâs the last thing you do . If Trump wins , it may be .",1
"I was watching a local news show about a business called “ Out of the Closet. ” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation . Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise , merely you can get free HIV and STD tests . I found this rather curious . Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “ Out of the Closet ” be offering HIV and STD tests ? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases ? I don ’ t need to be tested for HIV and STDs . The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV and STDs . If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another , neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD . The following is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) : “ Sexually Transmitted Diseases ( STDs ) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men , with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country . In 2012 , men who have sex with men ( MSM ) accounted for 75 % of primary and secondary syphilis causa in the United States . MSM often are diagnosed with other STDs , including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. ” One would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships , as well as shared drug needles , are destructive behaviors . We were told that anyone could get AIDS . There ’ s a commercial running today that makes this claim . If this is true , then all stores should be offering tests . But they don ’ t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do non engage in same-sex sexual activity . Another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation . Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt . When morality , science , and common sense conflict with liberal ideology , you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply .

"Congressional leaders and officials are investigating of Donald Trump ’ s foreign policy “ advisers ” has opened up communications with members Russian government , some of whom are under According to multiple sources the talks have discussed the that a administration would lift the sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its unilateral Crimea 2014 , an international Trump has refused to acknowledge .

"What emerged , though , was in format and outward appearance similar to debates past -- two people behind lecterns -- only this time featuring what appeared to be a seasoned politician and a political novice . And it was Trump , expected to earn points for style , who at times seemed rattled , one of several distractions related less to the content of what he said than the manner in which he delivered it . The give and take did n't make for a sterling night , necessarily , as political theater . But for those who concluded that hosting `` The Apprentice '' would ready Trump for this sort of exercise , well , it turns out those are very different muscles than the ones he had to put to use on Monday night . Clinton , clearly , came into the debate with a strategy that she prosecuted almost without deviation : The goal was to appear unflappable , relaxed and almost dismissive of Trump 's statements , while working in a few well-practiced zingers . That included pointing out that she had prepared for the debate , which offered a stark alternative to some of Trump 's riffing , disjointed answers . There were also some effective ad-libs , such as when she reacted to a rambling Trump response by saying , `` Just listen to what you heard . '' Related : One thing Clinton and Trump did n't debate : the debate itself Trump , by contrast , having faced multiple match during the primaries , looked uncomfortable in this one-on-one format . With so many people on stage during the primaries , his attacking style could stand out ; here , having to share the spotlight only with Clinton , it was harder to employ that hit-and-run tactic . He interrupted Clinton repeatedly -- at first to get in points , but as the debate progressed those interruptions increasingly felt like fits of pique , as if all the attack ads she 's running against him ( which he referenced ) had gotten under his skin . Trump 's sniffling , which persisted throughout , also provided a distraction -- not a big deal , in theory , but the kind of thing teed up to be ridiculed in real time on social media . Trump 's attempts to steamroll through certain exchanges created some problems for the third person in this mini-drama , Lester Holt . Holt , the `` NBC Nightly News '' anchor , had perhaps the most unenviable task one could imagine , given all the hand-wringing that preceded it and the Tuesday-morning quarterbacking that 's sure to follow . Holt acquitted himself well enough , occasionally fact-checking Trump 's statements -- usually when he sought to deny direct quotes that had been attributed to him -- and pressing him for specific answers . Those few moments when he challenged the candidate likely wo n't sit well with Trump 's most ardent supporters , but Holt at least avoided the notion that the moderator should be some sort of potted plant who asks questions and completely gets prohibited of the way . To that extent , his performance offered a measure of redemption for NBC News . Trump 's impulse to look for one-liners also let him down when Clinton hammered him for not releasing his tax returns . When Clinton suggested that he might be hiding the fact that he had n't paid any federal taxes , he interjected , `` That makes me smart , '' a quip that was both ill considered and potentially problematic for him in the days ahead . Related : NBC looks to Lester Holt for debate win after 2016 mishaps Indeed , if Trump is the more practiced performer , it did n't show . Clinton maintained an appearance of calm while Trump spoke , occasionally smiling but looking intent and engaged . Trump adopted a steely-eyed squint in the early portion of the debate -- somewhere between Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris -- but seemed less energetic as the evening wore on . Prior to the debate , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow noted that presidential debates are `` the most irregular , the least scripted '' of all major political events . As TV insiders know , reality television really is n't unscripted , and those programs benefit from the input of producers and editors in shaping storylines and the way characters are presented . In this first debate , anyway , Clinton stuck to her script , and Trump generally looked like he could have used a more detailed one .",1
"From the “ You Just Can ’ t Make This Up ” Department comes this story about the latest words that anti-free speech progressive leftists want to eliminate from the lexicon because of some contrived grievance or offense . Now , believe it or not , the term “ American BBQ ” has been determined to somehow be offensive by a college full of numbskulls . The fine people over at Campus Reform , who are keeping track of this kind it of idiocy , report : Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “ American BBQ ” because the administration deemed it too “ offensive. ” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform , Ariana Rivera , the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall , sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August 17 inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls . What in the hell is offensive about “ American BBQ ? ” Can you think of anything ? Me neither . However , according to emails obtained by Campus Reform , the term was somehow determined to be “ astatine military and recruitment-oriented. ” No kidding . Maybe it ’ s the term “ American ” that bothers these idiots . It ’ s getting pretty obvious that the Left wants all speech banned — all speech that they disagree with . Does political correctness know no bounds ? Email Subscribe",1
"There ’ s a reason far-left , progressive whack job Senator Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname Fauxcohantas . She ’ s as phony as a $ 3 bill . Warren earned that nickname after it was discovered that she lied for years about being part Native American , then when confronted , she touted her “ Pow Pow ’ s ” high cheekbones as evidence that he was Native American . She rails against Wall Street when she has made millions because of Wall Street . Warren went after Donald Trump when it was reported that he made money flipping houses without disclosing that she has done the same . We should be used to Warren ’ s feigning outrage because she does so when it is politically expedient . That leads to the Senate hearing today in which Warren grilled the CEO of Wells Fargo , John Stumpf , over thousands of workers being caught setting up fake accounts in order to earn bonuses . Wells Fargo has since fired those workers and said that there could live more people let go if they discover further shenanigans . But that wasn ’ t enough for Fauxcohantas . She had to get up on her hypocritical high horse when the cameras were running to score her political talking points . Although the individuals who actually bilked the customers out of money were fired , Warren has the audacity to chastise the Wells Fargo CEO because senior executives were not fired accusing him of “ gutless leadership. ” “ You haven ’ t fired a single senior executive . Instead , evidently , your definition of accountable is to push the blame to low-level employees who don ’ t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves . It ’ s gutless leadership. ” Where were these words from Elizabeth Warren when Barack Obama blamed low-level IRS employees in Cincinnati for the IRS targeting , harassing , and intimidation of conservative and Tea Party groups ? Where were these tough words when it turned out people at the top not only knew what was going on but orchestrated it ? Where was Fauxcohontas when Lois Lerner was able to retire with a cushy pension and faced absolutely no repercussions for her hand in the scandal . Where was Warren when Obama lied to the American people in an interview with Bill O ’ Reilly before the Super Bowl when he said there wasn ’ t a smidgen of corruption ? And did Elizabeth Warren demand that VA executives who were keeping fake log books in order to get bonuses be fired ? Did she go on record of accusing Barack Obama of “ gutless leadership ” for his failure to fire anyone when it came to the VA scandal or the IRS scandal ? Did she say Obama created the environment for such despicable exercise to occur , practices which led to the death of hundreds of veterans and impact on the livelihood of Americans who were simply practicing their First Amendment rights in criticizing their government ? No . Elizabeth Warren didn ’ t say a damn word about those things . Why ? Because it would not have been politically expedient . Yes , there ’ s a reason Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname “ Fauxcahontas. ” She ’ s a big , filthy , hypocritical fake and political opportunist . That was exposed and made perfectly clear with her rant against the swell Fargo CEO . Watch Elizabeth “ Fauxcahontas ” Warren in all her hypocritical glory . Email Subscribe",1
"George Bush Sr. is now 92 years-old . Do remember him ? He was the 41st of States and gave an speech for the State of the Union where famously said : “ is at stake is than one small country ; it a idea : a new world order , diverse are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace freedom the of law Such a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children ’ s future. ” Calling the States a ‘ small ’ enough but to use America as a to ‘ achieve aspirations of mankind ’ is quite another . Mankind doesn ’ t have any ‘ ’ . It s hard to get within the same culture agree on one thing , let alone the whole world many cultures I am no conspiracy but the phrase ‘ New World Order ’ our President so will have this discussion with one thing in mind . It reported that H.W . Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush wanted to stay silent about the the Presidency and who they support . former Maryland lieutenant governor and the late Robert Kennedy wanted to find out who Sr. supporting for the Presidency She asked him and then immediately took selfie with on Facebook . “ The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! a telephone , Townsend said met with the president in today , said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat ’ s what said , ” she told POLITICO . Townsend ’ s post , George Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in email replied , “ The vote Bush will cast as a citizen in some 50 days will be just : a private vote in some days He is not commenting on the race in the ” I my question to you this : Does it surprise you that the man who said the States is that must unite in a ‘ World Order ’ be voting for Hillary Clinton ? They similar belief . While President , Bush of the U.N. entrapments to sneak past our Congress . He introduced the s Common Core education , is an arm of Agenda 21 into our system in 90 s . Hillary also believes the United States to be small and more under the reign of U.N. treaties and such . They are not very different all . Now ? That guy is not part elite group trying to ‘ achieve the universal aspirations ’ . He ’ s all himself which means in turn he would be the kind of President who would be about the United . He doesn ’ t believe the U.S. one small country , like a cog in a machine . Trump believes that U.S. . Trump ’ are not the of ideals that Bush wants in the White House . It s dangerous because you know it the United States would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens all the Bush ’ s and Clinton work ? Many former GOP officials from both Bush have also announced support for Clinton over Trump , including national security adviser Brent and former Commerce Secretary Gutierrez One Bush who has taken ’ s side is former Vice President , who told POLITICO in an this summer he still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump . “ Clearly in heart of hearts I should hope they want a Republican president , but they can speak for themselves , Quayle said in an interview in July . Dan Quayle was a stud and opposite to Bush . It very for our country to end with Sr. after Reagan and not a Dan",1
"Obama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in . That was a certainty . He just doesn ’ t care . When he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees , I laughed . I told people he was planning on 250,000 and people ampere laughed at me . angstrom Now he says 110,000 and I ’ m telling you , it will be way more than that and many of them will be ISIS connected . Obama is not only terraforming the US into a Muslim nation , he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us . Just as he has done with race wars . It ’ s been the plan all along . Now they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it , but they are still defending their actions . They have no intention of slowing down , much less stopping the influx . This is one of those areas that I agree with Donald Trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people . Obama now knows that Hillary could lose , so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow . From the Daily Caller : Islamic State terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the U.S. , Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted Wednesday . “ I wouldn ’ t debate the fact that there ’ s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves , ” Kirby said on Fox News . “ And we ’ ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey , where they try to insert themselves into the population. ” He was defending President Barack Obama ’ s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year , a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits , saying the vetting process is “ good. ” Any sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks , many of which are directly traceable to refugees , would back off and consider their actions and the consequences . But not Obama . We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the UN and went all out for bringing in far more refugees . Obama hates America and he is a traitor to this country . Every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within . Yet , we are doing virtually nothing to stop him . Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our apathy and complacency . Obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism . We know it will too . Why are we just letting this happen ? Has America lost her will to fight and survive ?",1
"’ s a lot that could be discussed about last night ’ s debate , like the debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary , that ’ s not the main concern now . There thing that has many… . Hillary didn appear to usually stupid coughing self ! She was so ready answers detailed . Almost just as bizarre was that not she sputter or reach for a glass of water . This is so odd it has everyone their grandma question swirling around on social media the pictures appeared show Hillary with kind device embedded inside her ear…is that earpiece is wearing ? just something for old ladies ? Twitter may have figured out answer…do you see certainly wouldn ’ t be the first Hillary had to use for help . What do think ? Could it a trick of light and shadows ? A puffy zipper , perhaps ? Or was Hillary hiding a “ Cough prevention machine ” in her feminist pantsuit ? Hillary Clinton ’ s is fervently denying that she was an earpiece . Fox News reported “ Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said is seen the is merely a reflection of the TV lights a ” While we aren ’ t sure was going on inside Hillary ’ little head night we do have a interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that WikiLeaks archive , “ Did u take your earpiece or do need to get it ? Woods had hidden of humor that him on twitter… “ She can ’ t even # lie without from gaggle of other liars through an earpiece. ” Then added She literally can ’ help herself . She s the sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial. ” Of course , we don ’ t have of the earpiece , it been hearing aid . Hmmm one has about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past fumbled through her speeches . Some claim it s a reflection of lights . We ’ ll let you be the judge .",1
"The black man , Keith Lamont Scott , who was shot by a black police officer in North Carolina , was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing . He got back in the car and then got back out again , brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way . The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers . Scott ’ s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon . Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney . Sounds like a justified shooting to me . They lied about the book and ginned up riots there . Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence . They should all be arrested as far amp I ’ m concerned . From Young Conservatives : The family of Keith Lamont Scott , the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon , said “ no comment ” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right . If that isn ’ t an admission then their lawyer wouldn ’ t have told them to say “ no comment. ” Clearly , the video must ’ ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers ( which we already know to be the case ) . Had the family ’ s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line , they would ’ ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder . Tell me I ’ m wrong . I ’ m not , but you can tell me anyways . These riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt , but police officers as well . An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in . These riots will carry a heavy price tag . The police chief aver there is no definitive proof inward the video that Scott aimed the gun at the officers . It doesn ’ t matter . He had it in his hand and would not drop it . The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out . That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video . They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down .

"Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit , Hillary Clinton and her minions could never , ever in a million years pass a background security check . There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that ’ s no joke . They shouldn ’ t be cleared to clean a toilet there . The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training , briefings or courses on said security . Not only are these people willing morons concerning security , they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn ’ t do . It ’ s called deniable plausibility . The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents . Will they see them before the election ? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn ’ t hold my breath . From The Daily Caller : A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training , briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides . Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department ’ s motion to dismiss TheDCNF ’ s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act . But he also denied TheDCNF ’ s request to depose State Department officials . The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications . In addition to Clinton , TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan . Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here . But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet , I don ’ t look for them to do so this time . And for some reason they are never held to account for it . The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren ’ t the ‘ right people ’ . Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents . He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th . Bradley Moss , one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF , said “ Judge Leon ’ s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department ’ s continued obstruction of the FOIA process . State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure. ” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time . It ’ s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell . The word for this is ‘ corruption ’ . State Department officials admitted inch a july 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “ courses were not completed ” by Clinton or her aides . Well , duh . That ’ s for peon , not the elite evidently .",1
"Through the course of this election season , a dark cloud has hung over Trump ’ s campaign – OK , many dark clouds . Dark , racist , xenophobic , lying clouds . But the one we ’ re referencing here is “ what the hell is going on with his taxes ? ” The simple answer , as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate , is that The Donald simply hasn ’ t paid any federal income tax . Trump blamed Clinton for “ squandering ” taxpayer dollars , thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against . Clinton , of course , took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee ’ s own taxes . “ Maybe because you harbor ’ t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years , ” Clinton shot back , expertly placing the bait in the trap . And , of course , she didn ’ t have to wait hanker for Trump to try to grab the cheese . To emphasize his point , he accidentally admitted that she ’ s exactly right : “ It would be squandered too , believe me. ” Pay attention to the word “ would. ” Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes , which he called “ smart ” earlier in the debate . Is this the reason he doesn ’ t want to reveal his taxes , which he says he will release “ against his lawyer ’ s wishes ” if Clinton releases deleted emails ? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he ’ s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share ? When Trump says “ conceive me , ” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “ squandered ” but that he believes they “ would ” if he had paid any .

"Bill Clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who I ’ m sure want to take a shot at Hillary , but one of them is actually doing it . Once you listen to what he has to say about Mrs. Clinton and the reason she believes Hillary is having suddenly noticeable health problems , you ’ re going to find yourself agreeing . Dolly Kyle , who I had never heard of before right now , is the author of Hillary : The former Woman and has a long , sordid past with the Former President of the United States Bill Clinton . The book details some horrible interactions with the Clintons , including a situation where Hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the First Lady of Arkansas . Kyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the Hillary Clinton health issue . “ I really think she get been ’ cruisin ’ for a bruisin ’ , as we say in the South , because she ’ s such an angry person and so driven by this inner rage , ” said Kyle . “ People like that eventually break down , physically. ” But , she asserts , Hillary ’ s “ inability to keep her lies straight ” is not necessarily attributed to her anger , but “ cognitive impairment. ” I can ’ t say that I disagree . I ’ ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us . Of course this isn ’ t going to be true of all people , but I have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues . But Kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion Clinton feels . “ That paranoia , that tendency to be a control freak , has always been a part of her personality , ” admonish Kyle . “ I call her ‘ Hillary Scissorhands ’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals. ” I recommend buying Dolly ’ s book if you don ’ t already have it , because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next President of the United States . And with so many people , including former Secret Service agents , telling stories similar to the ones that Kyle has written about , there has to be some measure of truth to them . Do you think that Clinton ’ s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person ? Let us know in the comments of our Facebook page !",1
"Donald Trump appeared on Â Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees , a lack of profiling by law enforcement , and the First Amendment . Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second . Trump took aim at refugees ; however , bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami , 28 , is a naturalized citizen . A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.âÂ Trump responded to that by saying âfreedom of the cost pressâ was to blame . âTheyâre all beryllium talking about it so wonderfully because , you know , itâs called âfreedom of the press , â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw , â Trump said . âThey tell you how to make bombs . We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime . Instead they say âoh no you canât do anything , thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âThe websites are the same thing , those people should be arrested . Theyâre inciting violence , okay ? â he continued . âTheyâre making violence possible . They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Watch at around the 21 minute mark : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3GTRabASaY8 ] However , incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment . Think Progress reports : Itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful . Under a laxer rule , itâs possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself . In August , his statement that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could be able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat . On Friday , he called for Clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately , â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times . Most recently , his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested . The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists . Trump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists , âHeâs running his country , and at least heâs a leader . Unlike what he have in this country.â Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution . Itâs not up for debate , unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source . But if you ask Donald Trump Jr. , heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks . Ironically , Juniorâs pinned tweet reads , âLiberals love the first amendment until you say something they donât agree with.â He really should change that .",1
"To order anyone paying attention last night it was clear that Hillary did not win the debate against Trump . Sure , Trump was brash and he ’ s not your normal politician , but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country . Nevertheless , CNN did their best to make it look like Trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data . From Infowars : A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after last night ’ s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump . One problem – the survey sample included 41 % Democrats compared to just 26 % Republicans . Asked , “ Who do you think did the best job in the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ? ” , 62 % of respondents said Hillary while 27 % said Trump . This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump in the debate , and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate . However trump , 33 % of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents , 41 % identified as Democrats , while just 26 % identified as Republicans . This represents a disparity of 15 % between Democrats and Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked . Almost three quarters of the respondents were not Republicans and 57 % more Democrats were asked than Republicans . If the sampling was flipped , with 41 % of respondents being Republican and just 26 % identifying as Democrats , the outcome would almost certainly have been in Trump ’ s favor . I think you get the point by now…Donald crushed Hillary in last night ’ s debate !",1
"In another revelation from WikiLeaks we find even more information ! Hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from ISIS…good gosh , just when you think this vile woman couldn ’ t get any worse ! The company is French industrial giant Lefarge , from which Hillary accepted over $ 100,000 . Let us also not forget this : What is also shocking is that the City of Paris signed contracts with this company , despite information linking them to the Islamic State . TheCanary.Co reported on this shocking discovery : Documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that Lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in Syria , and even bought Isis oil for years . Yet according to the campaign group , SumOfUs , Lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the City of Paris for this summer ’ s Paris-Plages urban beach event . The project run by Office of the Mayor of Paris , Anne Hidalgo , will create artificial beaches along the river Seine in , centre and northeast of Paris . Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation , Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s , and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s . During her connection to Lafarge the the firm was implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam Hussein . The report went on cement confirm that the company ’ s Paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the Islamic State for to and oil transactions . Lafarge bought oil for its own operations , but also allegedly supplied the Islamic State with cement for its operations . You can ’ t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization , you ’ re either with them , or you ’ re not . You can ’ t have a middle ground because if you try to they will OBLITERATE YOU . You don ’ t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them . Hillary has borrowed over $ 100,000 from the very company who ’ s in support of ISIS , you know the group of crazy Muslims that want us all dead . Hillary Clinton is a traitor . Unfortunately , the laws don ’ t apply to Hitler…I mean Hillary .",1

"Sheriff Parnell McNamara For the vast majority of normal individuals , it wasn ’ t all that long ago , when we heard a phrase such as “ all lives matter ” we thought of it as a positive loving encompassing an inclusive statement , in that everyone ’ s life had purpose and should be celebrated regardless of race , age , sexual orientation or gender . Now fast forward to today and that innocent phrase that might have been spoken just a few short years ago has taken a life all its own , among the politically correct and entitlement class . Leave it to progressives and race hustlers to cleverly create a subtext of words and phrases , specifically designed to change the underlying or implicit meaning of those words and phrases original intent . And that ’ s perhaps where McLennan County ’ s top law enforcement officer , Sheriff Parnell McNamara , finds himself . It seems that the hapless sheriff isn ’ t up to speed with the continued changes taking place within the race baiting world of political correctness , and he ’ s now paying the price . His “ carnal sin ” was to purchase a full-page ad , in the Hometown News that says “ All Lives Matter , ” which of course has set off a firestorm of protests from the usual cast of characters McNamara acknowledged he bought the ad because of what he believes , saying : “ I remember talking to someone about ‘ All Lives Matter , ’ because it aggravated me when someone said ‘ All Lives Matter ’ is a racial slur . All lives matter . Your life matters , mine , police , John Q citizen . It doesn ’ t matter what color you are . Every human being has a right to live. ” And no doubt most traditional Americans feel exactly the same way ; however Sheriff McNamara works within a political environment where the political establishment sets the rules governed by what capture is currently politically correct , and publicly stating that “ all lives matter ” is now considered a racist statement within the bastions of progressive orthodoxy . And making that point was Jo Welter , Community Race Relations Coalition board chairman , saying ; “ You can say , ‘ All lives matter , ’ but the fact is throughout our history , and even currently , we do not value black lives as much as we do other lives. ” Then Welter went on to carefully cherry pick data that bolstered his ridicules claim . “ Black Lives Matter ” is divisive and counterproductive , State Rep. Charles “ Doc ” Anderson said . “ It doesn ’ t help the issues . It ’ s inflammatory , and I think it ’ s intended to be so , ” he said . “ Most members of the black community realize that all lives matter. ” McNamara added , “ I know of no police officer that puts his badge and gun on in the morning and goes to work wanting to hurt someone or kill someone , ” he said . “ We have black police officers that have been killed . It ’ s a movement against police out there that ’ s absolutely wrong. ” Sheriff ’ s office Sgt . Lionel McGee , put it all together . He is a black police officer who does not support BLM . He said some in the BLM movement will never support police . He said , “ I tell people all the time , the incident that sparked all this with Michael Brown in Ferguson , I probably would have done the same thing . You know , that ’ s what started it . The deal with ( Eric ) Garner in New York . He was 300-something pounds . I had this argument with my own sister . How come Mr. Garner couldn ’ t have said , ‘ Hey , y ’ all caught me selling illegal cigarettes on the street . You got me and put my hands behind my back , and let ’ s go lapplander to jail. ’ He ’ d still be alive today . “ If somebody ’ s fighting and struggling with you and you ’ re trying to arrest them and you ’ re doing everything in your power to arrest them , and that person don ’ t want to go and they happen to die or get injured or get seriously hurt , I can ’ t see that as being my fault. ” Do you agree with this Sheriff 's ad that states `` All Lives Matter '' or is this an insult to the black community ?

"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what ’ s going on , every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist . Oh how wrong they were , and still are . First off , racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color in their skin . Islam isn ’ t a race , it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization . This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they ’ ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins . The insanity , in this issue , is clearly on the side of the Democrats . After seeing how the world is working , Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in . Democrats think the world will agree with them , and they ’ re flat out wrong . Well , this has got to sting : The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue , and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up . The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism , and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values . The poll was first conducted of early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers . So Australians want to preserve Australian values ? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do . Yet , when Trump says “ America first ” it ’ s suddenly racist . Ok , yeah , that sounds logical . Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters . “ Floored ” by the results , the pollster laments that the “ basket of deplorables ” , who he previously thought were just a “ marginalised rump , out of step with the views of modern November mainstream , cosmopolitan Australia ” , is too big to ignore . He writes : “ This not a ‘ basket of deplorables ’ who sit outside the confines of polite society , that is 49 % of the men and women who make up our nation . “ Yes , they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘ other ’ but 40 % of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too . Look around you right now , there are people in your workplace , in your street , on your train , who agree with Hanson. ” Do you hear that , Hillary ? This is how you respond to people who oppose you . You don ’ t call them “ deplorables , ” you recognize that half the country is against you . Let ’ s get this done in , . ( Source : Breitbart )",1
"It definitely wouldn ’ t be all that surprising if George H.W . Bush is voting for Hillary Clinton . After all , his son Jeb didn ’ t do all that well during the primary campaign , and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump , no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump ’ s coronation . shaking Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they ’ re voting for . In “ , they ’ ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether . But one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . That insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy ’ s daughters , Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend . She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland . On Monday , she posted a picture of her The hands with Bill Clinton ’ s predecessor with the caption : “ The President told me he ’ s voting for Hillary ! ! ” According to Politico , Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker ’ s Point in Kennebunkport . Later in a phone interview with Politico , the Kennedy daughter confirmed , fact That ’ s what he said. ” But when pressed about it , a spokesman for Bush would neither confirm nor deny . In an email to Politico , Jim McGrath wrote , “ The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that : a private vote cast in some 50 days . He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. ” Politico noted that George H.W . Bush wouldn ’ t be the first from his or his son ’ s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald : “ Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump , including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. ” The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’ s camp requested to have the most embarrassing piece of equipment to help her stand tall against Donald Trump during the debate on Monday — a step stool so that she would not be dwarfed by Republican rival Donald Trump ’ s 6 ’ 2″ frame . Hillary , standing at only 5 ’ 4″ , was apparently worried that she would look short and weak standing next to the Republican presidential nominee , but the commission for the debate basically said tough luck as the rejected her request . Instead , according to the Drudge Report , they will be making a custom podium that will help accommodate for the differences in superlative . But wait , there ’ s more !

"I love Texas ! I barely mean I really love their attitude . They are like the honey badger , they just don ’ t give a damn about what everyone else thinks . Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama . Governor Abbott told Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns . Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States . Abbott doesn ’ t want modernise to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals . The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw . The Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings . Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US . “ The federal government ’ s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation , ” the governor said in a statement . “ The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations . Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism , President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S. ” “ While many refugees pose no danger , some pose grave danger , like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston , ” Abbott said . “ Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas , the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless , and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people , ” he added . “ Therefore , Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program . I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives. ” So take THAT Mr. President !",1

"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N . Assembly . During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise . He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his `` JV team . '' Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force , he said that we have no chance of winning this battle . The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group . He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution . `` If we are honest , we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long , '' said Obama . President Obama continued by saying that we must `` be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy . '' He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as `` a place like Syria , where there ’ s no ultimate military victory to be won . '' Instead Obama suggested that we `` pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect . '' Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable ' people to try to deal with . It 's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence . These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist . It 's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today . Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get 's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse . It 's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action . We radical past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone 's feelings .

"As most of our readers are well aware , there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . Following in the wake of Clinton ’ s near collapse at the 9/11 memorial service earlier this month , some have suggested that Clinton may be suffering from some sort of neurological disorder that is causing her to have dizzy spells and difficulty walking or standing , particularly when dealing with steps . There is sure to be renewed speculation in that regard following a bit of video that emerged Sunday via a Twitter post from Clinton pool reporter and ABC News journalist Liz Kreutz , who happened to catch Clinton as she washington leaving a building in New York City , according to the Conservative Treehouse . Clinton was exiting the Appleseeds Kids Center and preparing to descend a set of stairs when Kreutz approached , camera rolling , and began to ask questions of the candidate . Clinton just left `` Apple Seeds '' kids center in Flatiron . Feeling good about debate ? `` Getting ready , getting ready ! '' pic.twitter.com/mXxBbMiVcu — Liz Kreutz ( @ ABCLiz ) September 25 , 2016 As can be seen in the video , Clinton seemingly ignored the reporter ’ s first questions , instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended . Once she was about three-quarters of the way down the stairs , only then did Clinton turn her attention to the reporter , flashing axerophthol sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions , replying with only “ Getting ready ” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate Monday evening . She then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van , without any assistance , though a Secret Service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her . While it is entirely plausible that Clinton didn ’ t see or see the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps , this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs . The video certainly reinforces the supposition that Clinton suffers from selective hearing , picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her . Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see Hillary Clinton seemingly struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs , so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity . What do you think of the apparently extra-careful manner in which Hillary Clinton was spotted descending a small set of stairs ? Scroll down to comment below !",1
"In an interview with a Toledo , Ohio news station , Donald Trump accidentally admitted that his âbigâ 20-second announcement that Barack Obama was born in the United States , âperiod , â was just a ruse . Speaking toÂ ABC6/FOX28 , Trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a âwink and nodâ fashion . âThis announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe chairwoman Obama was in fact born in the United States , after all the years where youâve expressed some doubt , what changed ? â interviewer Ben Garbarek asked , prompting Trump to explain that he caved because he didnât want to talk about it anymore â no other reason : âWell I just wanted to get on with , I wanted to get on with the campaign . A lot of people were asking me questions . We want to babble about jobs . We want to talk about the military . We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS . We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because youâve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs , military , taking care of our vets , etc.â Yes , being able to âget onâ with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the President by demanding his birth certificate , college transcripts and applications , and other documents he wasÂ would prove that Barry Soetoro ( as the President is known in birther circles ) is a Kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as President through what we can only assume isâ¦magic . Sadly , this accidental admission that his views on the Presidentâs birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately , with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump Foundationâs misuse of charitable funds to pay The Donaldâs personal legal fees , attacking African-American communities , and practically publicly masturbating o'er the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey .

"An examiner has determined Tyre King , the 13 African-American boy fatally shot Columbus , OH police last Wednesday , was “ more likely than not ” running away from an at the time he was shot . would seem to the police narrative , holds that was shot in a confrontation with after “ pulled a BB gun on them ” . King was shot 7:42 pm last Wednesday after officers responded reports of an armed a group of three African-American teenagers According to the official police report , “ officers the males and to take into custody when one suspect pulled waistband One shot struck the suspect multiple times. ” The Columbus coroner ’ office has an autopsy of King ’ s body but the results won ’ t be made public least six weeks It was this delay prompted King ’ family to hire an examiner , Francisco Diaz , is professor of pathology at the University of Michigan as a for County MI . a released by family ’ attorney today Diaz said that based on the location the direction wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds. ” It is not question that King was involved in the robbery ; indeed his friend Demetrius Braxton , 19 , who King that night has since been arrested , said King “ wanted to for money. ” Diaz ’ s report , however , confirms the suspicions of many the across country that the use of lethal force by responding officers unnecessary and that story King aiming his gun police had been concocted as . Indeed Braxton ’ s account of the encounter , before the results of Diaz s investigation were reported , similarly contradicts the official narrative . He told the local that the cops said ‘ get down and We got down but my friend [ King ] got up and … [ and ] when he ran cop shot him. ” The last time we checked , petty thievery does not carry death sentence in United States of America While many will be to argue that the it for committing robbery , consider this . When white men are convicted of rape in America , like Brock Turner judges because they think they deserve a . When young commit crimes are smeared as career criminals and executed on the spot .

The injustice of such becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer . And what is most insidious these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police , as they have done in King ’ s case by claiming that he was his weapon at officers when was shot . than the peaceful protests of Black Matter , it is these fabricated standoffs between police black youth that fuel fiction of “ war on police.

"Germany ’ s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible , adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants . This quickly turned into a horror show , as crime was unleashed onto German cities , with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year . The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany , because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel ’ s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin . Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could , citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided , and that she regrets the mistake she made , also referring to multiculturalism as a “ living lie. ” According to the Daily Mail , Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference , she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis , ‘ we can do this ’ , but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx . ‘ A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society , even in a country like Germany , ’ she said . The leader , once known as the ‘ Iron Chancellor ’ , won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face . However , she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals . ‘ We want to , and we will , noticeably reduce the number of refugees , She she told the conference in Karlsruhe . ‘ With an approach focused on the German , European and global level , we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration. ’ Mrs Merkel attempted to defend her August decision , which drew hundreds of thousands to Europe , claiming it was a ‘ humanitarian imperative ’ . She appealed to the party ’ s sense of history , saying that the same strength that allowed it ‘ to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle , and to go from division to a reunified country ’ would get Germany through the crisis . She said she was , on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers , urging bolstered protection for the bloc ’ s external borders , support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states . ’ also touted a range of measures already undertaken in Germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants . Mrs Merkel , who has been the country ’ s leader for a decade banking tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘ sick man of Europe ’ and ‘ should be a country that is open , curious , tolerant and even exciting ’ . It ’ s nice that she recognizes this , but it ’ s too little , too late . It came as no surprise to anyone voting Trump , but then again , it ’ s getting tiring to say “ I told you so ” so many times to so many different people . Hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country , so there ’ s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election . We have to stop her in November by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences . ( Source : Daily Mail )",1
"You ’ ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say , “ Don ’ t like abortion ? Don ’ t have one ! ” Perhaps during the slavery debate in our country , a similar bumper sticker could have read , “ Don ’ t like slavery ? Don ’ t own one ! ” Proponents argue that abortion doesn ’ t affect most people , so people shouldn ’ t care . It ’ s between a woman and her doctor . They say that pro-lifers shouldn ’ t be able to force their worldview down everyone else ’ s throats . They shouldn ’ t be able – through legislation – to “ force ” childbirth on women who don ’ t want to have babies . So , since the issue isn ’ t affecting anyone , except the mother – and the baby who doesn ’ t get a say , but that ’ s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants . ( Even though the baby isn ’ t her body . ) You could say the same thing about slavery . It didn ’ t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave , but they didn ’ t view slaves as people then ( kind of like how unborn babies aren ’ t people either ) – so , if you didn ’ t like slavery , good for you . Don ’ t own any . And don ’ t force your worldview down everyone else ’ s throats . Well , here ’ s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who ’ s comparing abortion to slavery . Except , she ’ s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery . And allowing federal backing for abortion would be “ setting women free. ” Here ’ s CNS News : Kierra Johnson , executive director of URGE : Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity , testified Friday before the House Judiciary Committee examining the Hyde Amendment , which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest , and compared the amendment to slavery , saying that repealing the Hyde Amendment is about “ setting uracil ( women ) free. ” Johnson responded to a question on the impact of the Hyde amendment on low-income women , referencing an earlier comment from Rep. Trent Franks ( R-Ariz. ) in which he compared the Supreme Court ’ s Dred Scott decision to abortion , saying , “ It ’ s interesting that we ’ re bringing up slavery in this space . When you own somebody ’ s decision-making , you own them. ” “ The Hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance , ” she argued . “ It is about returning decision-making back to women . It ’ s about setting us free . “ When you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value , you own them whether you decide they ’ re valuable as black or not , you actually don ’ t get to make that decision , ” Johnson emphasized . “ We are valuable , and women cost valuable . The Hyde amendment simply says set us free , ” she said . “ We are not simple-minded . We are not being duped . Women are choosing to be pregnant and have children . The majority of women who have abortions are parents . They care , they care about their families. ” “ We should repeal the Hyde Amendment , ” she concluded . There should be no federal funding for abortion , period , regardless of how the baby was conceived . In the vast majority of cases , people want abortion for convenience . They want sex without consequences . Even in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don ’ t punish the baby . It wasn ’ t the baby ’ s fault . The baby merely becomes an innocent bystander . Instead of punishing the baby , the rapist should be the one to be aborted .

"Police were called to a New Jersey elementary school after a 9-year-old student said , '' Brownies , '' while talking about snacks , his mother alleged . Another student reportedly misinterpreted the comment and thought it was said in a racist way , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer . A teacher subsequently called police . “ He said they were talking about brownies , ” Stacy dos Santos , the child ’ s mother , said . `` Who exactly did he offend ? '' Dos Santos added that the incident has made her think twice about sending her child back to the school in intimate the fall . “ I ’ m not comfortable with the administration ; I don ’ t trust them , and neither does my child , ” she said . “ He was intimidated , obviously . There was a police officer with a gun in the holster talking to my son , saying , ‘ Tell me what you said. ’ He didn ’ t have anybody on his side. ” Officers also spoke to the children ’ s parents , and the incident was reported to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency . Collingswood Police Chief Kevin Carey stated during a meeting with school officials that they should report incidents to police , including cases “ as minor as a simple name-calling incident that the school would typically handle internally. ” Police also said they were advised to refer almost every case to Child Protection and Permanency . This policy was a shift from the previous one under the Memorandum of Agreement between the police and schools in New Jersey , under which incidents were reported only when deemed serious enough . Such action was typically taken in cases involving drugs , weapons or sexual assault . Since the meeting , officers have been called to the school as often as five times per day . “ Some of it is just typical little-kid behavior , ” teacher Megan Irwin said . “ Never before in my years of teaching have I felt uncomfortable handling a situation or felt like I didn ’ t know how to handle a situation. ” The mayor , police and Camden County Prosecutor ’ s Office ultimately arranged a meeting to discuss incidents . “ In our discussion today , you and your staff made it abundantly clear that our recent meeting was to reinforce the applicability of the Memorandum of Agreement , but not to expand its terms , ” Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley wrote in a daytime letter to the prosecutor ’ s office , the Collingswod Patch reported .

"The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats , insulted at having been dragged into this show trial , took the opportunity to instead flip the script . During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen ’ s hearing , Democrats began ignoring the “ impeachment ” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump ’ s numerous tax scandals , including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud . Of particular interest was Trump ’ s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit . Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense . An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election . The head of the IRS – who presumably how , thing or two about this – agreed . “ Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns , if they want to , because they ’ re under audit ? ” Rep. Jerry Nadler , a Democrat from New York asked . “ No , ” Koskinen responded simply . Another Democratic representative asked it another way . “ Would releasing the person ’ s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return ? ” Rep. Ted Deutch asked . “ The release itself wouldn ’ t . The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided , ” Koskinen said . In other words , Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad , or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time . This answer actually confirms what Trump ’ s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad . It wasn ’ t the audit that scares Trump , it ’ s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what ’ s in them and that would destroy his father ’ s chances of becoming president . It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election . It won ’ t matter then . The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “ What have we done ? ” expressions painted on their faces . Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose , such as his actual income a what he pays the government in taxes , clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving . Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D-Calif. ) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival . Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia , to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses . “ Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations ? ” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( D-Texas ) . The answer was no . Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles ( a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr. ’ s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy ) . He later clarified that , unlike some people , he wouldn ’ t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one . It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker . The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups . The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn ’ t seem to bother them . The impeachment hearing , widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show , came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of knows frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become . They settled for grandstanding . So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone ’ s time , Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is . Waste not , want not . Watch the IRS hearing , starting with Rep. Nadler ’ s investigation into Trump ’ s lies , here : Featured image via YouTube Billionaire Nick Hanauer says things need to change , but not the way we expect .",1
"I can ’ t wait for “ Weekend has Chelsea ’ s ” to hit the big screen . CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton ’ s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script . If this woman , God forbid , dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow , these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has , understandably , reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “ minor setback ” to her “ inevitable ” victory . The American people aren ’ t buying it . This is a severely ill woman . No more “ conspiracy theory ” dismissals . Mrs. Clinton ’ s “ mild cold , ” er , “ seasonal allergies , ” I mean “ heat exhaustion , ” that is to say “ minor case of pneumonia ” is , evidently , of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “ mystery man ” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “ episodes ” ( or otherwise freezes up with a brain “ short-circuit ” during a speech ) . This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot ( also covered up ) and carries in hand what many medical experts say she a Diazepam pen . Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures . Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures . These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers ( since when has “ pneumonia ” required a neurological squeeze test ? ) . The Clinton campaign needs to come clean . They won ’ t , but they should . I wonder what official “ diagnosis ” we ’ ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they ’ ve been there a hundred times before . “ Nothing to see here , folks . Secretary Clinton ’ s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘ powered through ’ yesterday going door-to-door. ” The point is that , once more , by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced ( and justified ) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president . She ’ s proven , yet again , that is can ’ t be trusted . She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters , as revealed by her historically low approval ratings , have formed relative to her health and character . She ’ s a liar . That ’ s her default mode . She ’ s corrupt . And she ’ s sick . Very sick . She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation , and even her own life . Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton ’ s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers ? Well , no on the first , yes on the second . “ Do not gloat when your enemy falls ; when they stumble , do not let your heart rejoice ” ( Proverbs 24:17 ) . Indeed , Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week , but her poll numbers were already trending downward . Her medical crisis over the weekend , coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump ’ s supporters as a “ racist ” and “ irredeemable ” “ basket of deplorables , ” at only served to accelerate the plunge . Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman . This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd , D-W.Va. , her “ friend and mentor. ” Sen. Byrd , of course , was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK . This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband , former president Bill Clinton , was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans , not unlike those she just slandered , worked hard to pass it . Finally , and going back a bit further , this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them . Who ’ s the racist ? I ’ m praying for Hillary Clinton . Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling , and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie , our eyes have been telling us the truth for months , maybe even years now . To watch this increasingly frail , bitter and elderly woman stiffen up , convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach . You can ’ t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her , wicked though she may be . It ’ s almost tragic to witness . Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment . Everything she ’ s ever done or said , and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she ’ s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime , has been designed to place her in the Oval Office , not as first lady , but as president of the United States . Proverbs 19:21 says , “ Many are the plans in a person ’ s heart , but it is the LORD ’ s purpose that prevails. ” Am I saying there ’ s no chance Hillary Clinton will win ? Not at all , though I think it unlikely . Between her devoted media harpies , her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up , there ’ s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory . Still , it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton ’ s political aspirations . Even so , I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee . When they visit her in prison .

Keith Lamont Scott , a father of seven , was killed by police in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve . The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night , starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte . But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel , some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd . Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel , and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance . His family said Scott , an African-American , was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book , waiting for his son to come home from school . But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun , not a book . He said officers couldn ’ t find a book at the scene . “ It ’ s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard , ” said the police chief , who is black . “ It ’ s time to change the narrative because I can tell you from the facts that the story ’ s a little bit different as to how seat it ’ s been portrayed so far , especially through social media. ” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book ?

"This actually happened in June , but is just as pertinent today , especially with 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the US next weekend . Police in New Mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle . The drive was an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East… that ’ s bad enough , but what is even worse is what she had in her car . The woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her . This just screams ‘ terrorism ’ . I have no idea why they pulled her over , but it was a very good thing they did . It has been widely reported that hundreds , if not thousands , of Islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border . Judicial Watch released a report last summer saying that Mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country . They furthermore released a second report just a few months ago saying that Islamic terror groups residing in Mexico have begun traveling to America in order to seek out potential targets . That border has now become a literal ticking time bomb of terrorism . It ’ s not ‘ if ’ , it ’ s ‘ when ’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of Barack Obama and the Marxists who are for open borders . They want America to be like Europe… Europe which is toast because of the Hijrah Migration and terrorism . No thanks . From Mad World News : Police in New Mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented , Middle Eastern woman . However , the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert . Judicial Watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in Luna County , New Mexico pulled over an unidentified “ Islamic refugee ” for an undisclosed reason . Luckily for everyone involved , the minor traffic infraction turned project into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession . The pipeline is in Deming , New Mexico , and U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’ s ( FBI ) Joint Terrorism Task Forces ( JTTF ) have been sent to the area to investigate . Unfortunately , the find could only be indicative of what is to come . Obama could bring in up to 250,000 Islamic refugees this next year . He is seeding them across America in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the US into an Islamic nation . Bringing in unvetted Islamists guarantees ISIS terrorists in their midst and Obama is good with that . What ’ s a few dead infidels to him ? The plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of Deming about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces . Thanks to high unemployment , poverty , crime and a horrible public education system , Deming has been named No . 1 on a list of the “ ten worst places ” to live in New Mexico . The entire region is considered a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area due to large amounts of meth , heroin , cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers . The brutal Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in that area . The media has swept this under the rug , but it is a severe national security threat . This election may pivot on it , especially if we get hit . Our leaders get owe it to their constituents to put our safety first , lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants . Before we lose countless Americans to terrorism that is .",1
"Tonight 's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is must-see TV , and many celebrities will be watching from home , as well as from the front row . Billionaire entrepreneur and `` Shark Tank '' co-star Mark Cuban has confirmed that he will be taking a front-row seat at the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York to cheer on Team Hillary . Just got a front row seat to watch @ HillaryClinton overwhelm @ realDonaldTrump at the `` Humbling at Hofstra '' on Monday . It Is On ! `` Obviously , I 'm a not a Trump fan . I am a Clinton fan , '' Cuban told ABC News today at the red carpet season premiere of `` Shark Tank . '' `` I think she 'd make a great president . `` I do n't think he 's got the skill set , '' he said about Trump . `` Let 's put it this way , if he came on 'Shark Tank , ' I would n't make the investment . I just do n't see him as being capable in the least bit . '' Trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers , the variety show performer who famously had an affair with Bill Clinton before he became president . If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row , perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him ! Although Trump 's campaign manager told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos that Trump did not actually invite Flowers , it seems she was willing to accept the invitation . Hi Donald . You know I 'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate ! ... ? ? Meanwhile , other celebrities are gearing up to watch the first debate between the two candidates tell .

"have been crossing lines announce votes for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this year ’ s general election in seen . Now , reports that the highest level defection yet comes former President George Bush , who to Kennedy that it was time to go public favor of the Democratic ’ s Hillary Clinton : Bush , 92 , had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump , sign in and of itself his distaste the . But his preference for the wife of own successor , President Bill , nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Kennedy . Republican Party s of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins learned Spanish . It s no that the eldest Bush of the would declare early vote Hillary Clinton . Both of Texas ’ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas , who are both conservative news organizations , endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this year s , kick off next week . It be to elder statesman ’ s rare crossing party lines , knowing that he can trust the of Hillary ’ s national and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched any party ’ s possibly all our nation ’ s history .

"For decades , employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want . Of course , what helium generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway . Jobs get outsourced , wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced . It hasnât been since , well , the last presidential election , though , that weâve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side ( Republican ) loses . Four years ago , it was âPapaâ John Schnatter , who threatened to cut his employeesâ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through . It did and he didnât . This year , another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnât get his way . Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carlâs Jr. and Hardeeâs . Hereâs one of his commercials , which may not be safe for work : Judging by the commercials , like Donald Trump , Puzder likely cares little about political correctness . But thatâs not the reason he wants a Republican in office . He just doesnât want to pay people more , or at all . In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal , Puzder says that if a Democrat wins , either Democrat , he will fully automate his stores . Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa , Puzder wrote : âI want to try it , â CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans . âWe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa , where you order on a kiosk , you pay with a credit or debit card , your order pops up , and you never see a person.â âWith government driving up the cost of labor , itâs driving down the number of jobs , â he says . âYouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores , but in restaurants.â âThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders , and Hillary Clinton , and progressives street who push very hard to raise the minimum wage , â says Puzder . âDoes it really help if Sally makes $ 3 more an hour if Suzie has no job ? â Source : Yahoo Finance This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees . Across the country , Puzder has about 20,000 employees . Heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests . Puzder also has his own blog , where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism . One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is . Puzder is doing just fine . In 2012 , it was reported that he made nearly $ 4.5 million . His profits have been up in recent years , but his employees donât see any of that . In fact , Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied . You can guarantee , though , that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same , Puzder will still be automating . Thatâs just the way he is : profits over people .",1
"As if Trump s plan to ban Muslim immigration ’ , his to stop Islamization of America another component also interest deporting Muslims who express for Sharia law . In a bad turn of events , some actually attempted to hilariously defend Sharia in response to the latter . CNN commenter Kohn took , writing “ Hey Trump , many progressive — the ones should support in fight extremism — in Sharia ! ” By the , Kohn is a lesbian , would be death under law There ’ s among scholars of Islamic law that death is the punishment for homosexuality – the debate is over how they be killed ’ s “ , ” we have more reasons to despite progressivism . I ’ m people aren ’ t on board with beheadings for apostasy , and cutting the of . Now , as Dennis Michael Lynch reports , s clear what of law ( Sharia vs. American Law ) many Muslims America actually prefer . Fox News went to interview the Somalian Muslims on the of Cedar to learn the about how they really feel living in America and American . Every single one of them in following video said they prefer Sharia law over law “ If ’ re a Muslim , you want Sharia , ” they say . They believe it ’ s ok to kill if they insult Mohammad . They believe it s perfectly normal to force their daughter to marry someone she reaches the age 15 . When asked if they would prefer to live in America or Somalia , say prefer Somalia And the stunning of all is a young man the of the interview who admits , “ I ’ m Americanized I just speak fluent and I an articulate what I ’ m trying to say , but as far as my culture and my preferences I ’ m still Somalian. ” Watch the video Fox News also featured another interview on the Riverside streets in May where it was stated that they at least two Islamic schools that teach Sharia law : Scary . These results are consistent with a American conducted by the Center for Policy last year . found More than 51 % of U.S. Muslims polled also believe that should have the choice of American or shariah , or that they should have their tribunals to apply shariah . 39 % of those polled said Muslims the should be subject to American . America is a nation – but that doesn t should tolerate the intolerance of Sharia .",1
"As this bizarre election cycle heads into the home stretch , the issue of race relations in America has become almost all-consuming . Add the shootings of two black men in Tulsa and Charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder keg is remarkably short . As the left contends that systemic institutional racism is alive and well in this country , the right fires back with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. quotes to prove that it ’ s not . While liberals decry the shooting of unarm black men as evidence of the violence and oppression inherent in the system , conservatives write it off not as black men being killed but rather as “ thugs ” getting what they deserve for “ non-compliance. ” One of the favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all Americans under the constitution and instead convict them with their past records . Forgetting that institutional racism extends into police departments and court systems , making young black men more susceptible to arrest and conviction , we know about every instance of driving without a license , resisting arrest and jaywalking ever perpetrated by every black man ever shot and killed by police . Today , while looking through a Twitter feed at a Fox News report about Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby being charged with manslaughter for killing a man with his hands in the air , I came across a tweet that shows that racism is without ampere doubt alive and well in America : @ foxandfriends @ blp3pic.twitter.com/JmjD5DNCRA — Theresa ( @ VOTE_TRUMP_ ) September 23 , 2016 Once again , conservatives feel the need to point out that the police officer who killed a man shouldn ’ t be held accountable because he was a very , very bad person . There ’ s only one problem here : the tweeted information is about the man killed in Charlotte , not Terence Crutcher , who was killed by the officer in question . My response was as simple as I could possibly make it : @ VOTE_TRUMP_ @ foxandfriends @ blp3 Why is another man ’ s record relevant ? Oh…because “ they ” are all the same , right ? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer ( @ wilekenmeyer ) September 23 , 2016 Terence Crutcher being judged on the criminal record of Kieth Lamont Scott isn ’ t really that surprising , is it ? What ’ s far less surprising is that nobody bothered to mention the mistake . That ’ s because my response was accurate . To the conservative racist , It makes no difference which black man was convicted of which crimes or that they comprise two different individuals separated by a dozen states who had never met . “ They ” are all the same . How fitting is it that her handle is “ @ VOTE_TRUMP_ ” Because…of course it is .",1
"The wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband . You don ’ t actually see them shoot him , you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them . She kept saying he didn ’ t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had . Gee , did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun ? Regardless of her claiming he didn ’ t have one , you can plainly hear the officers telling him to put the gun down repeatedly . He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in . The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn . That is when they shot him . You can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something . He evidently did it and it involved the gun , which got him a dirt nap . I ’ m sorry , I have no sympathy for any of this . He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot . From Western Journalism : The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday , according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott ’ mho s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times . Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg , N.C. , police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers . Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott ’ s fingerprints and DNA . The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg . Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott . I don ’ t understand his wife either . There ’ s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point . And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it . He ’ s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for . The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims . Typical . Scott ’ s family , initially contended that he was carrying a book , but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “ impossible to discern ” what , if anything , he was carrying . They urged police to release the footage . “ There ’ s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively , threatening or maybe dangerous , ” said Justin Bamberg , one of the lawyers representing the family , said in an interview early on Friday . Well , you can ’ t see anything in the damned video , so I guess that is right . But you can hear the police telling him to drop the gun again and again . Despite law enforcement ’ s refusal to release any footage , Scott ’ s family gave a video recorded by his wife to siemens NBC News . It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities ’ press conference ended . That was totally staged . I ’ ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter . The police can ’ t win for losing here .",1

"Hillary and the compliant media are doing everything they can to derail Trump ’ s surge in the polls and keep Hillary propped up ( literally ) . There seems to be some movement among blacks toward Trump . A five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward Trump would be significant . When things begin to go south for Democrats , they play the race card . Claiming that President Obama might not have been born in the United States is a “ race card ” issue . Trump raised it in 2011 . This forced Hawaiian authorities to release a copy of Obama ’ s birth certificate , although it was not a copy of the original . It ’ s obvious from the historical record that Trump did not originate the birther issue . It was floating around before he took up the quest for the truth . From what we know , and the media are not reporting , the birther subject was spawned in the bowels of the Clinton campaign . Did Hillary personally promote it ? Probably not . It was done by surrogates so she could claim plausible deniability . “ Who me ? ” She had and has her “ buffers ” like all crime families do . The following scene is from the Godfather II Senate hearing : Here is some of what we know : “ [ Ben Smith and Byron Tau ] detailed in a lengthy four-page-long investigation how in April 2008 , when Clinton was slipping in her battle against Obama for the Democratic nomination for the presidency , ‘ Clinton supporters ’ —as they say—circulated an anonymous email chain that pushed the theory . “ ‘ Barack Obama ’ s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy . She was not allowed to travel by plane then , so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth , ’ the email that Clinton supporters circulated read. ” “ Those anonymous people were hardly the only ones . In fact , as Joshua Green reported in The Atlantic in August 2008 , a March 19 , 2007 strategy memo from longtime Clinton adviser Mark Penn proves that the Clinton campaign itself was pushing the conspiracy theory . Penn , in the memo , advocated that Clinton target Obama ’ s ‘ lack of American roots. ’ ” ( Breitbart ) Read more : “ Hillary Clinton and the True History of Obama ‘ Birtherism. ’ ” I suggest that you read the entire Breitbart article to see how Hillary ’ s 2008 presidential campaign was knee-deep in the suggestion that Obama was not born in the United States and his “ lack of American roots. ” [ 1 ] But the birther issue goes back further – to 1991 . Joseph Farah of WND asks , “ Who Was the First ‘ Birther ’ ? ” “ Trump was hardly the first ‘ birther. ’ Neither was I . Nor was my colleague Jerome Corsi . And neither was Hillary Clinton . “ That honor belongs to one person and one person alone – Barack Obama. ” How is this possible ? “ Obama went 16 extreme lengths to conceal his past . And , indeed , if he was born in the U.S. and was eligible to serve as president , he certainly did his best to create the mystery that led to the question being asked : “ Years earlier , he billed himself as having been born in Kenya . “ Maybe he thought it was a sexy way to sell books , get a foreign student scholarship , attract women – who knows ? “ But it ’ s a fact that he boasted about it. ” ( WND ) The evidence ? It comes from a short bio that was “ used by Barack Obama ’ s literary agency beginning in 1991 and ending in 2007 – the year he declared his candidacy for president. ” Here ’ s the first sentence of the opening paragraph ( Breitbart ) : “ Barack Obama , the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review , was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. ” Even Snopes says it ’ s true . The editor of the short biography states that it “ was a simple mistake and nothing more ” to say that Obama was born in Kenya . I ’ ll take him at his word . I can ’ t take him at his word given what the two images below show . It remains a fact that there was a biography from a “ client list Acton & Dystel published in 1991 ” that states that Obama was born in Kenya that remained unquestioned until 2007 . Obama himself had to years to disavow the information and call for a correction . It would have been unusual for a literary agency not to send a copy of the bio to Obama for his approval . Are we to believe that in 16 years in never saw the bio ? In addition , there is ample evidence that people inside the Clinton campaign gave credence to the Kenyan birther issue for political reasons in order to sabotage Obama ’ s campaign . The media will continue to claim that Hillary Clinton had nothing to do with the birther issue because a lie is better than a Trump presidency . UPDATE . The following images were posted on my Facebook page . In this first image , in June 1998 , Jane Dystel Literary Management company was still reporting that Obama was born in Kenya As recent as 2007 , Dystel & Goderich Literary Management continued the narrative that Obama was born in Kenya : _____________________________ [ 1 ] “ NOTE FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT [ at Breitbart ] : Andrew Breitbart was never a ‘ Birther , ’ and Breitbart News is a site that has never advocated the narrative of ‘ Birtherism. ’ In fact , Andrew believed , as we do , that President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , on August 4 , 1961. ” Reposted With Permission From Constitution.com The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below .",1
"Months ago , former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheâd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election . For the most part , former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. dubyuh and George H.W . Bush have optedÂ to stay out of this election â until now . Word of George H.W . Bushâs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke , and itâs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party , but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead . Itâs a controversial decision , but obviously Bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country . The Trump campaign , as you can imagine , isnât taking this lightly . In an interview with CNNâs Erin Burnett , Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it . Conway said that although she ârespectsâ Bushâs choice , itâs ironic that heâs voting forÂ âthe wife of the humanity who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992 . Conway alsoÂ chalked up Bushâs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to Trump in the primaries . She said : âThis was a bruising primary , and Jeb Bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â You can watch the interview below : âJeb Bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @ KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting # Clinton https : //t.co/iyhiLRgrPL â OutFrontCNN ( @ OutFrontCNN ) September 20 , 2016 This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be . The Bush familyÂ is making a responsible , informed decision during this election , and that is way too much for scoop and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around . This election is no joke â itâs about far more than Republican and Democrat parties . Itâs about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it â and the Bushâs are smart enough to recognize that .",1
"New Jersey ’ s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival . Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “ Bridgegate ” scandal by a judge , as WNYC reports : The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead , the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment . If it passes the Democrat-controlled body , the trial would be in the Senate , where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict . Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate , they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict . Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential ’ s nominee Donald Trump ’ s transition team chairperson . Just four days ago , federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor , accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City , which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world ’ s fussy bridges . Governor Christie was Trump ’ s most authoritative surrogate , as well as the first major “ conservative ” Republican endorser , in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump ’ s benefaction . Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor . Famously , Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference , which you can see below in its painstaking detail . It ’ s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor ’ s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th , 2014 , just two short months after his re-election , and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services . BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town . Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides , and stood by , and did nothing , though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages . The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration ’ s bare knuckle political bullying . We will scout this story closely , and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment boot Christie is facing , because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year ’ s Republican Presidential campaign . Watch his shame :",1

"In the wake of the bombs found in the Chelsea area of New York , Seaside Heights , and Elizabeth , NJ , we ’ ve received a letter from a Marine , known only as “ J ” , that wanted his voice heard , amidst the sea of political nonsense on the mainstream media . Here it is , unedited . Dear Obama , Hillary , and liberals scared of the “ T ” word , I ’ ve served my entire adult life in the United States Marine Corps , and I love this country , but that ’ s not important , because a man is judged in life by his actions , not his words . When you were given the task of protecting America , instead of giving people the tools to do it themselves , you treated them like children that couldn ’ t be trusted with their own safety . You stripped away their freedoms and promised them that you had everything under control . You allowed un-vetted , America-hating refugees that pledged allegiance to ISIS and other radical regimes and ideologies to walk freely , while they plotted to destroy the country from within . That ’ s exactly how you topple an empire without firing a single shot , and you ’ re falling for it like a bunch of amateurs . Repeat after me : You are not equipped to handle this . You ’ ve built your entire agenda on the false notion that fundamentalist Muslims either don ’ t exist , or can ’ t harm us because they ’ re on the other side of the world . Well , take a wild guess what happens when you import them to our shores and tell them that anyone criticizing Islam should be shunned , no matter how suspicious they act . It ’ s how you end up with attacks like the one in San Bernardino , and how you get bombings in New York City and Elizabeth , and Seaside Heights , where Marines were staging a summer run for charity , with the exact same IEDs I ’ ve seen used to kill my brothers and sisters while serving in the Middle East . When George W. Bush said “ Fight them over there so we don ’ t have to fight them here , ” this is what he was talking about . The fight is here , and you might as well have sent them a written invitation . to you ’ re too scared to say it , I will : These bombings were a textbook definition of terrorism . It doesn ’ t get any more clear , and every minute that goes by that you ignore it , the men willing to kill innocent people grow stronger . These attacks were enacted by those who want to literally terrorize our way of life . They hate our freedoms , and want – above all else – to control us , much in the way that you want to control our actions , speech , , political motivations . But America is better than that . We ’ re not children that need to be led by the hand into a den of wolves . We ’ re the country of prosperity , strength , and built on the idea that we don ’ t take threats kindly . We have the most advanced military in the world , and a God-fearing citizenry that , unlike your liberal friends , won ’ t kneel to evil men . We ’ re the real America that you ’ re actively trying to silence , that gets things done by working together and ensuring that anyone coming in to the country better have a damn good reason for doing it . We support the police , that put their lives on the line when disarming a bomb , despite your best efforts If call them all racist monsters . We ’ re the ones going to work to keep the country running while the entitled brats that voted for you go on social media and complain about why life isn ’ t fair . We are the people you come running to when shit hits the fan , and we will stand no longer while you try to destroy this country by kowtowing to terrorists and fill pointless speeches with nothing but empty words and lies to the America public . The way I see it , this leaves you with three options : Take action , step down , or let America run over you . The choice is yours . Just don ’ t say I didn ’ t warn you . -J",1

"On Friday , I reported that of those arrested in Charlotte , North Carolina , 70 % of the provocateurs and rioters were from out of state . However , one writer is now questioning why they are not facing federal charges of crossing state lines in order to engage in rioting and destruction . James Lonstreet writes at The American Thinker that the Department of Justice has a “ disinterest for potency certain laws ” and it has engaged in “ non-enforcement of the law has become sport in the past eight years. ” Lonstreet says that the number of out of state rioters who have been arrested should pique the interest of the DOJ , but it doesn ’ t . Instead , the Justice Department has become so corrupt that it no longer seeks justice . He writes : Criminals disguised as protestors cross state lines to engage in destruction and rioting . Has anyone heard of the statute that prohibits crossing state lines to engage in such behavior being enforced by federal authorities ? From the Federal Judicial Center , 2101 . Riots : ( a ) ( 1 ) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce , including , but not limited to , the mail , telegraph , telephone , radio , or television , with intent – ( A ) to incite a riot ; or ( B ) to organize , promote , encourage , participate in department , or carry on a riot ; or ( C ) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot ; or ( D ) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot ; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) , or ( D ) of this paragraph shall be fined not more than $ 10,000 , or imprisoned not more than five years , or both . ( b ) In any prosecution under this section , proof that a defendant engaged or attempted to engage in one or more of the overt acts described in subparagraph ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) , or ( D ) of paragraph ( 1 ) of subsection ( a ) and ( 1 ) has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce , or ( 2 ) has use of or used any facility of interstate or foreign commerce , including but not limited to , mail , telegraph , telephone , radio , or television , to communicate with or broadcast to any person or group of persons prior to such overt acts , such travel or use shall be admissible proof to establish that such defendant traveled in or used such facility of interstate or foreign commerce . There is a wisdom to such laws , one that predicts how local situations can blossom into much larger events when interlopers are allowed to exacerbate the situation . These laws need to be enforced . They are not . It is fair to ask , “ Why not ? ” Recall in Ferguson that the influx of non-residents ( Revolution Club of Chicago , New Black Panthers , etc . ) who came to join in the fray was noted by local authorities , yet there was no action from federal authorities regarding the enforcement of statues prohibiting the crossing of state lines to engage in such behavior . Whoever incites , sets on foot , assists , or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof , or gives aid or comfort thereto , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years , or both ; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States . ( June 25 , 1948 , ch . 645 , 62 Stat . 808 ; Pub . L. 103–322 , title XXXIII , § 330016 ( 1 ) ( L ) , Sept. 13 , 1994 , 108 Stat . 2147 . ) ” source He then concludes , “ There are two clarities . The administration has sympathies in one direction , and the Department of Justice has disinterest in another direction. ” This is not the first time that Lonstreet has brought this issue up . In 2014 , he wrote on the issue when it was the New Black Panthers stirring up rioting in Ferguson , Missouri . At that time , he cited the same law and wrote , “ The proof is for all to see . The New Black Panthers once again are not prosecuted at the choice of federal authorities . ( Recall Philadelphia polling incident . ) Need we mention who those authorities are ? ” Picking and choosing which laws to enforce is problematic for sure . This administration not only often targets innocent Americans , but then allows the lawless to escape punishment . Perhaps it ’ s time the people brought justice upon their criminal representatives in DC and institute new government , as the Declaration of Independence advises us to do .

"Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican party . ( CNN ) Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter said undecided voters are different this election cycle because they 're `` absolutely clued in '' with who the candidates of both major parties are -- and they still do n't like what they see . `` Normally what you see in those groups , people who are undecided , they 're undecided because they really have n't been paid much attention , '' Walter told CNN 's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation . Walter , who also worked for former Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky , said undecided voters sounded like children trying to avoid hopping into a cold pool . GOP policy guru : Trump ca n't 'fake his way through 90 minutes ' `` Here , these undecided voters are absolutely clued-in and they 're like that feeling we all had in school when you had to jump into the cold pool in first hour P.E. , and you 're like , ' I do n't want to get in there , I . n't want to jump in there ! I know I 'm going to have to get in . ' So , they are undecided because they do n't want to make a choice , not because they do n't know about their choices , '' she said . Walter said for the first time that she can remember , she 's having trouble trusting the data that 's coming from the campaign trail , and that undecided voters are struggling to choose between the lesser of two evils . Voters say this is the ultimate 'lesser of two whether ' election `` What I hear from these groups , is just this idea of like 'You know , I do n't know if I trust Hillary Clinton , ' '' she said . `` One woman said , ' I do n't trust Hillary Clinton on terrorism ' -- to sort of get to your point of instability in the world -- 'but Donald Trump is going to get us into World War III . ' So , that 's why people are like ' I 'd rather cut my arm off than have this election , because that 's what you 're making me choose from . ' '' Walter , who also previously worked for CNN , described how the political polarization between different demographic groups , in particular white voters and evils they have a college degree , ca n't be blamed entirely on Donald Trump . `` It has been a dramatic shift , '' Walter said . `` You ca n't blame that all on one candidate who had a great rally .

"The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail outrage , where they acknowledged criminal activity yet resist to charge her anyway , has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll . Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary ’ s top aides , including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills , even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination . Now , the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey ’ s fate . Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen , demanded that he lose his job . “ This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director ’ s fitness for office , ” DiGenova said . He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills ’ computer . “ The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity , ” he said . “ This was not a real investigation . This was a ‘ protected investigation ’ designed to look like an investigation. ” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently , they listened . This week , Comey will have to answer for his behavior . Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation ? He isn ’ t just having to face a hearing ; he ’ s been issued a subpoena from Congress , too . Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton ’ s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them . In a further attempt to get Comey to comply , Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to coughing up the documents . How loyal is Comey to Hillary , really ? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her ? And if the answer to that question is “ yes , ” then the new question becomes… why ?",1
"When you WATCH this VIDEO you MUST have tissues out . The further into the video I went , the more I cried . It starts out with a guy saying , “ This goes out to the people who support Black Lives Matter . Until I see y ’ all protesting black on black crime that goes on in our neighborhood every f * * * ing day , shut the f * * ck up goin ’ around saying that Black Lives Matter . Shut the f * from ck up with that sh * t ! ” You might wonder what he ’ s talking about so here are some statistics from the Uniform Crime Report ’ s Supplemental Homicide Reports published annually by the federal government that support his concern on black on black crime . These numbers explain why this guy is saying that black people are killing black people… because they are and en masse : ⦁While only 6 % of the U.S. population is identified as black and male , 57.9 % of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males . ⦁ However , 73.1 % of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen . ⦁ 42.6 % of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6 % of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6 % of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males * In 2012 , white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders . That same year , black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders . In other words : black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts . The figures above highlight a horrific truth that black racialists and white liberals routinely ignore : Lawbreaking black Americans , young black males particularly , put themselves in close proximity to ( mostly white male ) police officers at rates sometimes five to 10 times higher than whites . This is a recipe for disaster . Thusly… . Blacka are only 13 % of the population but have committed half of homicides the the United States for nearly 30 years . DOJ statistics show that between 1980 and 2008 , black people committed 52 % of homicides . In 2013 , black criminals committed 38 % of the murders . Whites accounted for just 31 percent . There are five times fewer black people than white people in America and , yet , they consistently carry out a larger share of the crimes ? Given this rate , it ’ s no wonder that there aren ’ t more assistances where cops kill black criminals . The video then leads to the speech of a police captain who is reporting on the drive-by shooting of a little girl and how he now has to send his officers out there looking for suspects with a gun under their seat . The video then goes into an emotional string of video where you see police officers hesitating to a criminal with a gun pointed at them , the officer always gets shot when hesitating . It helps anyone understand WHY police officers MUST shoot when being threatened , if they don ’ t they will be killed . Here are statistics that really show you who is getting killed more often ; white criminals are . Of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force * 2009-2012 : ⦁ 915 ( 61.4 % ) were white males ⦁ 481 ( 32.2 % ) were black males ⦁ 48 ( 3.2 % ) were males of other races ⦁ 28 ( 1.9 % ) were white females ⦁ 15 ( 1.1 % ) were black females ⦁ 4 ( 0.2 % ) were females of other races If there is anyone who should be afraid right now it should be : 1 . White male criminals because you ’ re more likely to get shot by police . 2 . Black person who lives around black people because you are more likely to become a victim of homicide around more black people . 3 . People who are in the Black Lives Matter movement because you are increasing your risk of injury just by being in an environment where the cops are your enemy… who will protect you ? Plus you are literally standing among the people who commit the HIGHEST disproportionate amount of violent crimes in the nation . 4 . All of us because the BLM are going to destroy the greatest police force in the world that protects our Bill of Rights better than anyone right now . We are about to get a Federalized police force and the Constitution is DEAD without in local Sheriff . 5 . Police Officers because they ’ re in more danger today than ever before because of the farce of Black Lives Matter movement giving people permission to shoot white Police Officers just because . NOW , watch this VIDEO to truly understand what Police Officers go through and how their hesitation may cost their life and the lives of others .",1
"The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill . I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency , but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election . What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama ’ s legacy ? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap ? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “ for the first time in my life I ’ m proud of my country. ” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “ # BringBackOurGirls ” sign . But why recollect her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration ? * insert mechanical applause here * But what would her role be ? What is she even qualified to do ? It ’ s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children . If you doubt that , read this tweet : I mean , how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children ? For an additional wave of nausea , read Hillary go on and on about her “ faith ” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology . Of course , Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids , as reported by The Washington Post . Back in February , she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids , either . “ I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work , ” she said . “ I have a rest-of-my-life horizon. ” This reeks of desperation . Is Hillary trying to capture the “ I don ’ t like Hillary , but I do like the Obamas ” vote ? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm , people will find it harder to speak out well-nigh the indoctrination taking place because , you know , racism or something . Either way , I ’ m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children . The government is not one gigantic parental unit , nor should it be viewed as one . That is an extremely dangerous idea to have , as nothing good has e'er come out of complete government control over the average citizen .",1
"President Obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror . He assures us that ISIS is decimated and that we have little to fear from the looming presence of radical Islam throughout the world . He ’ s wrong . Not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical Islam , at best , our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of Islam . However , as weak as our response to ISIS has been , it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war . According to an Iraqi source , ISIS has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein . “ Special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 ISIS militants of those who slept in the hospitals of Nineveh , ” the Iraqi source said . constitute “ What has been stolen from those members included the kidneys , intestines and more ; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city. ” The source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons , said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields . “ This came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding , particularly with regard to crude oil , which it provides about 80 % of the imports of the terrorist organization. ” It is gratifying to see that ISIS must tighten their belts . However , what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical Islam and so long as the Western world confuses idiocy with tolerance , it ’ s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix have this problem .",1
"Hillary Clinton used the first presidential debate of the general-election season to launch a full frontal attack on Donald Trump , baiting him into fights over his personal finances , taxes , sexism , race relations , business dealings and personal honesty . If Clinton came looking for a fight , she found it . Her aggressive tone drew Trump in . He attacked Clinton right back , showing flashes of anger that channeled public frustration and also the coarser side of his public persona . It made for some lively exchanges , including several that brought an edge to Trump ’ s tone . “ She doesn ’ t have the look , ” Trump said toward the end of the debate . “ She doesn ’ t have the stamina. ” Trump appeared rattled at times , particularly as the debate wore on . Yet his main attacks on Clinton were rooted in policy grounds , as he sought to give voice to public anger not just at clinton but at the broader political class . “ You ’ ve been doing this for 30 years — why are you just thinking about these solutions now ? ” Trump said in a section of the debate about ways to create jobs . “ I have thought about this quite a bit , ” Clinton countered . “ Yeah , for 30 years , ” Trump responded . Trump stretched facts and attacked Clinton ’ s temperament . He — for the most part — kept his cool . Throughout the debate , Clinton called Trump “ Donald. ” He almost always referred to her as “ Secretary Clinton ” and made sure that was all right with her . “ I want you to be very happy . It ’ s very important to me , ” Trump said , challenging the fact-checkers once again . Trump was brought onto his shakiest ground of the night when moderator Lester Holt brought up President Barack Obama ’ s birthplace — specifically why it took Trump until just weeks ago to declare the matter settled . Trump flatly said , “ I say nothing ” to those who wonder why he pushed the matter as long as he did . And he falsely accused Clinton of starting the birther question in 2007 , claiming credit for putting the issue to rest . “ equitable like she can ’ t bring back jobs , she can ’ t produce ” Obama ’ s birth certificate , Trump said . Clinton pounced on an issue with resonance among black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition . “ It can ’ t be dismissed that easily . He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen , ” she said . “ The birther lie was a very hurtful one. ” Apparently worried that Trump would be on his best behavior , Clinton started her barrage early . She suggested that Trump ’ s success is inherited , and that he ’ s hiding his tax returns to avoid embarrassment . “ Maybe he ’ s not as rich as he says he is , ” she said . “ Maybe he ’ s not as charitable as he claims to be. ” Trump didn ’ t even bother to deny Clinton ’ s suggestion that he hasn ’ t paid income taxes “ for a lot of years , ” turning even that into an argument against the status quo . “ It would be squandered too , believe me , ” Trump said . Clinton also found a groove in attacking Trump on Iraq . Trump again insisted that he was against the Iraq War before it started , a statement for which there is no public record in support of his claim . For his part , Trump took Clinton on consistently , attacking her along jobs , trade and national security , using her as a stand-in for politicians in general . “ I have a feeling that by the end of this evening , I ’ m going to be blamed for everything that ever happened , ” Clinton said at one point . Trump : “ Why not ? ” Clinton : “ Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. ” Clinton had one of her better moments in declaring her fitness for office , keying off of Trump ’ s criticism of her for retreating from the campaign trail . “ Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate . And yes , I did , ” she said . “ And you know what else I prepared for ? I prepared to be president . And I think that ’ s a good thing. ” Later in the debate , Trump allowed that Clinton has experience , “ but it ’ s bad experience , ” he said . “ This country ca n't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience , ” Trump said . After the first extraordinary encounter between two extraordinarily unpopular nominees , the plays are clear . Clinton is putting her experience up against the anger Trump is channeling , anger that has two distinct sides to it . They proved they can get under each other ’ s skin . But neither candidate proved that he or she has a winning message , not on the night of the first debate .",1
"In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever , an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable ( or unwillingly ) to un-earth : Proof that Hillary Clinton conspired to cover up her “ un-wise ” use of a private server and email scandal . Through the power of social media , a Twitter user @ GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation . Paul Combetta , the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State , allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary ’ s name from classified emails . He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “ stonetear ” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs . In his requests for help from the public at large , Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “ Unamed VIP Client ” from email servers and archives . “ Hello all , ” induce one of the posts begins . “ I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP ’ s ( VERY VIP ) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox , as well as a PST file . Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone . … Does anyone have experience with something peril like this , and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished ? ” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data . Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish : proof of Hillary ’ s Clinton ’ s criminal activity . The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question : is the screen name “ stonetear ” definitively Combetta ? In not , the evidence is circumstantial . If so , the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up . To support the argument that “ stonetear ” is in fact Hillary Clinton ’ s IT specialist , @ GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections : This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them . As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee , the work of the American people , both as investigators like @ GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot , will not remain silent . `` How to delete an IT guy who uses Reddit and make it look like an accident '' # ThingsHillaryGooglespic.twitter.com/P41uwzYWAD @ realDonaldTrump — Boca Vista ( @ bocavista2016 ) September 21 , 2016",1
"The Weiner is back , yet again , in the news and if you thought he couldn ’ t get any more disgusting , well you would be stupid…I mean , come on . It ’ s Anthony “ Douche ” Weiner…I like the sound of that . Anyways , back in January , Anthony Weiner , 51 , who at the time wasn ’ t in the process of divorce with top Hillary Clinton auxiliary Huma Abedin , supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons . “ I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent , ” stated Weiner as he was interviewed on FoxNews Online . The details are this . Back in January of 2016 , Weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl . We know that he knew she was 15 because using the KIK , a popular social media app , he had asked the girl what high school she went to . Yeah , that kind of drains all doubt that he didn ’ t know she was underage . Let ’ s not forget , this man is married . So sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he ’ s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting and evil this piece of turd is . Both the girl and Weiner sent sexually consign pictures and texts back and forth . Weiner also eventually ended up at the girl ’ s home when her father wasn ’ t there . The girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn ’ t comfortable with where it was heading and he immediately stopped . The girl ’ s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter ’ s mental health is in jeopardy . “ If there ’ s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward , maybe use my daughter ’ s example to have the courage to come forward , I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn ’ t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on , ” he continued . She ’ s gone through some depression , we ’ ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it , he said . She ’ s a bright girl , very smart , so this make somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it ’ s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away. ” Alright Dad . Wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator , no doubt…but let ’ s give some sense of responsibility to where it ’ s due . Your daughter engaged in the relationship . She is not some innocent angel you believe she is . How the hell does Weiner end up inside your home ? Did he break in ? Just be honest about it . Weiner ’ s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time . About time .",1
"The government ’ s answer to every failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it . Ever since government education has become the norm , kids are dumb and dumber . But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don ’ t have enough money . So , they throw more money at it , and the problems only get bigger . Ever since the War on Drugs was declared , we ’ ve spent over $ 1.5 trillion , and drug use remains unchanged or even worse . But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue , their answer is to throw more money at it , in hopes that they ’ ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all . But it only gets worse . The same is true with the “ War on Terror. ” The U.S. government dumped $ 5 trillion into it , terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds . But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the Middle East – the politicians ’ answer is to expand our foreign policy , and of course , throw more money at it . And terrorism continues to grow . From Zero Hedge : According to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford , professor of political science at Brown University , spending aside the United States Departments of denial , State , Homeland Security , and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $ 5 trillion USD . Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $ 19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $ 5 trillion USD on war , the focus of this article is to ask : What has all of this spending achieved ? As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year , terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 ( they probably should rename it “ the war of terror ” ) . In 2014 , the outlet noted , it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq , Nigeria , Afghanistan , Pakistan , or Syria . As stated by Paul Gottinger , a staff reporter for Reader Supported News , out of the aforementioned countries , “ only Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year. ” Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now . Why wouldn ’ t they ? Until recently , Nigeria was Africa ’ s great oil producer , as well as the continent ’ s largest economy until last month . And look at this shocker from Ben Swann : “ Before the 2003 U.S. invasion , do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq ? None . In the country ’ s history there had never been one .

Republicans like all inherited to completely sheltered from any , while for the most part , disagree The compromise has been that only estates at a whopping 5.45 million $ 10.9 for couples ) are taxed . below that free . Now , Hillary Clinton , after prodding Sanders and his followers , her estate tax plan trust me when I say Donald Trumpâs wonât be happy .

Instead , sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary , and now proposes turning the levy into a taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top of 65 percent last the estate tax that level was in 1982 though back it kicked in on smaller . Beyond all that , Clinton said she would do with the step-up in basis at death , rule allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that , say their parents or rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before away . the end , the expects these measures to about $ 225 billion over ten years .

As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses , in 2013 , only 20 small businesses and family farm estates , in the entire country , had to pay estate taxes . The other common Republican argument is that are âdouble taxationâ ( if every dollar in the American economy been taxed multiple times ) , but the reality is that what comprises estates comes , which are also unlikely have every been taxed . course , even if Clinton is have a tough time passing this , at least long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House . He wants Trumpâs kids to zero in estate taxes . Of , for all we know , Trump himself pays in taxes",1
"From the Daily Caller News Foundation : A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $ 216 million since 2009 , were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation ’ s capital : prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners , according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation . At least 15 of the Clinton Foundation ’ s corporate donors — representing $ 47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners . Significantly , the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all , but were ensconced in the Department State ’ s Office of Protocol . The protocol office , chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists . Despite the Democratic presidential nominee ’ s departure from the Department of State in 2013 , all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama ’ s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House or in Hillary ’ s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns . Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton ’ s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “ walked away ” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office . After Cheng left the Department of State , he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation . He is now Hillary ’ s national fundraiser , leading her presidential bid to raise $ 2 billion . As a result , The Daily Beast once called him , “ Hillary Clinton ’ s $ 2 billion money man. ” If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation , he may have violated a special “ Memorandum of Understanding ” ( MOU ) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008 . The MOU warned of avoiding “ potential or actual conflict of interest. ” Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208 , a federal statute that “ prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests , ” including those of a prospective employer or a family member . “ How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol , migrated over to the Clinton Foundation , ” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation . “ We don ’ t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng ’ s personal cell phone , or on a contact list that might have been emailed. ” he said in an interview with TheDCNF . Neither the foundation nor Hillary ’ s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng . Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action , asserting , “ to the best of my knowledge , nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation. ” Yet , official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington , D.C. , and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce . Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors , but they also offer privileged access to the president , top White House staff and many cabinet members . Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova , who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington , D.C. , told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren ’ t only benefits , but amounted to the “ selling of access. ” “ The obvious connection between donations and access to big , White House state dinners is very important , ” he said in an interview with TheDCNF . “ It was clearly a reward to donors , something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation , ” he stated . DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case . “ We are looking into Cheng ’ s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class , ” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF . Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group , the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust ( FACT ) . “ Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation . He had substantial input as to who was invited , who got seated where , ” he said . “ I would say Cheng ’ s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing , ” Whitaker added . “ It ’ s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation , not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department , but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House , ” he told TheDCNF . FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act . The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015 , but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election . “ They have been stonewall us and not responsive and now they ’ re telling us that we probably won ’ t get it until mid-to-late November , ” Whitaker said . He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009 . The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans . When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office , his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who , at age 32 , served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president . After Cheng left in 2011 , his replacement was Natalie Jones , who was Hillary ’ s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid . Jones was joined by Mark Walsh , Hillary ’ s LGBT “ outreach director ” from her 2008 campaign . Peter Selfridge succeeded marshal in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office . He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton ’ s White House . One of the most revealing illustration of Cheng ’ s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges . In a March 8 , 2012 email from Marshall to Jones , Cheng and Hillary ’ s deputy chief of staff , Huma Abedin , the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14 , 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron . “ Invited to state dinner , ” Marshall informed the group . Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov . Terry McAuliffe , who gave between $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 , and Fred Eychaner , who committed $ 25 million to the foundation . “ Nice , ” replies Abedin . Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton ’ s official business , Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals . In a June 11 , 2012 email , he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner . “ Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night ’ s Clinton Foundation dinner , ” he wrote Abedin . Among those attending was Recep Ozkan , a Turkish national who donated between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million to the Clinton Foundation . Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen , a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan . Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen , according to Tuesday reports . Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk , the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma , who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office . The email was obtained by Citizens United , a conservative group , under the Freedom of Information Act . One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta , a long-time personal friend of Bill ’ s who was convicted of insider trading . He served two years in a federal penitentiary . Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job . Without any experience , he paid her a six figure salary . Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009 . Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began inwards the 1990s during Bill ’ s first term at the White House . At the time , Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors . “ To see the pattern , you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House , the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom , to sell seats on Air Force One , ” Ortel told TheDCNF . “ So this was an old game. ” Rep. Marsha Blackburn , the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation , told TheDCNF , “ This is further evidence of the Clinton ’ s ‘ Pay to Play ’ mentality . The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government ’ s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check. ” “ The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything , ” Blackburn charged . Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman Sachs ’ chairman and CEO , attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19 , 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao . His company donated $ 1 to $ 5 million to the foundation , and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 , according to the Clinton Foundation website . But that wasn ’ t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary . The company also gave the couple $ 2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues . Brian Moynihan , Bank of America ’ s CEO and chairman , attended the May 19 , 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon , Mexico ’ s former president . The Bank of America Foundation donated between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million to the Clinton Foundation , and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 . But Bank of America also paid more than $ 1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary . The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were : Honeywell , GE , Dreamworks , PepsiCo , Morgan Stanley , Coca Cola , Dow , Boeing , Intel , UPS , Comcast , IBM and the Blackstone Group . Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners . J.T . Mastranadi , political director of the Citizens United , said his organization ’ s conclusion was , “ regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance. ” TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary ’ s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation . Neither responded . To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners , click here .

"The House Oversight Committee has ordered the website Reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip Hillary Clinton ’ s email address from her emails . ( If you are unfamiliar with the story , read this first ) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz , the chairman of the Oversight Committee , told The Hill that the order “ has the weight of law , you can ’ t destroy things and hope things magically get erased. ” The posts in question appear to have been made by Paul Combetta , a technician at Platte River Networks , a Denver-based computer firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server . They were deleted on Monday , just after Internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the Web . In the posts , a user going by the handle “ stonetear ” asked other users for advice on how to “ strip out ” email addresses from the account of a “ VIP. ” “ Basically , they don ’ t want the VIP ’ s email address exposed to anyone , and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out , ” reads the post , which was published on July 24 , 2014 . That date is a significant point on the Clinton email timeline . Just the day before , the House Select Committee on Benghazi had reached an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton ’ s work-related emails . The FBI ’ s report of its investigation of Clinton ’ s emails shows that that same month , Combetta transferred backups of Clinton ’ s emails to two of her lawyers , Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson . “ Stonetear ’ s ” post on Reddit raises questions about what was being covered up . And if “ stonetear ” is Combetta , as seems likely , the Reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up . Combetta is the technician who used a software program called BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton ’ s emails in late March 2015 , weeks after Clinton ’ s email setup was revealed in the press and after Congress had subpoenaed all of her records . He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his decision to use BleachBit . Regardless , the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation . Last week , Combetta and another Platte River Networks technician named Bill Thornton declined to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing . Both technicians pleaded the Fifth . The allegations that Combetta posted questions about Clinton ’ s server on Reddit “ fit the pattern of what we think was happening , ” Chaffetz told The Hill . Another Oversight Committee member , North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows , said that while the circumstantial evidence “ certainly points in one direction ” — that “ stonetear ” is Combetta — the Committee wants to have definitive proof that he is . “ We ’ re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way , because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts , ” Meadows told The Hill . Chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts , “ but we are pursuing it with vigor. ” Numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “ stonetear ” is Combetta . Combetta ’ s email address is [ email protected ] , and other posts from the user refer to exploiter facts known about Combetta , such as that he lives in Rhode Island . TheDC uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that Combetta interrogative is the Reddit user . In some of the Reddit posts , “ stonetear ” refers to an email encryption service that Platte River Networks uses called Mimecast . He also refers to Datto , Inc. , a cloud storage company that PRN hired to service Clinton ’ s server . A spokesman for Platte River Networks told TheDC on Tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that it will “ soon. ” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience .

"Terrorism seems to be producing more stupidity than fear , I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb goes off in America or when the words Allahu Akbar is screamed out when a mass shooting takes place . I get to listen to a New York Mayor tell the nation pop that the bomb blast had no relation to the bomb blast in New Jersey on the same day . I guess the FBI could learn a lot from this Mayor . A reporter on Fox News says the bomb could have been a pressure cooker that someone put in the garbage can by mistake . The media will put on experts and have many opinions to tell all about something that needs no explanation except just one . These Muslims are going to kill us unless we kill them first . When law enforcement catches or kills one I could care less about his personal history that the media always uses to make a good story to tell . The only thing I care about is punishing him without the pleasure of giving him a life sentence in adenine a prison where he gets to choose his food from a Muslim menu , free medical service , recreation facilities , a TV to watch his friends terrorist activities all over the world and a Quran with a prayer rug . Terrorists should be tried by law within thirty days after their capture and sentenced in the same time frame . I am just a simple man and I would rather form my own opinion than letting the media doing it for me . After all , who wants to be stupid ?",1

"Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer , he ’ s an entitled whiner . Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth , New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture . Ironically , he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know , his culture . In the lawsuit , the family complained bonk that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002 . The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them . Ahmad , 28 , his father Mohammad Sr. , 53 , and his brother Mohammad , brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said : ‘ Muslims don ’ t belong here ’ . The lawsuit , filed in the federal court in Newark , says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002 . From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so . The lawsuit says that the police had a ‘ reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff ’ s constitutional rights of liberty , due process and equal protection ’ . The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’ embarked on a course to harass , humiliate , retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm ’ . The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘ too much crime around here ’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘ known for criminal activity ’ . The irony of it all is that just 5 years later , Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting . Hmmm , it ’ s not like a person goes from selling allege fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years , right ? I ’ m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it ’ s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he ’ s been planning this for some time .",1
"Saturday Obama gave a speech to , Black Congressional Caucus where he had ample opportunity to give courage to Americans in a scary time . However , he didn ’ t say anything about the recent attacks then and as of noon ( East Coast Time ) Monday , President Barack Obama has made ZERO comments on the string of terrorist attacks hitting cities in the United States . Over the weekend there were a number of terror attacks in the name of ‘ allah ’ that has devastated some communities and killed or injured dozens of people . Check out the list below and tell me if you think the President should have made a speech Saturday the Sunday or especially today to give solace to the victims families and communities being terrorized ?

"In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council , Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government . In stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin , who uttered the famous words , “ Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety , ” Obama called on Americans to give up more liberty for security . “ We can only realize the promise of this institution ’ s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints , ” Obama said . He then added that “ powerful nations ” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security . “ I ’ m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action , not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules , over the long-term , enhances our security. ” Obama said . Of course , Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations , an organization that is anti-American , anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core . So , what ’ s the problem ? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line ? Wasn ’ t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance ? Did those materialize ? Nope . This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we wanted ve documented that . While Obama , a clear foreigner by his words , his wife ’ s word ’ s , a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament ( despite what Trump and others say ) , claims that his view is the right one , he also acknowledges that real Americans , born and bred here , oppose him . These people do so rightly . “ Sometimes I ’ m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions , but I ’ m convinced in the long run… ” Obama said . “ We have to put our money where our mouths are. ” Yes , but the problem is America is not normal to the international community . She has been unique throughout her history . She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible , not upon “ international norms , ” which were pagan in origin . That ’ s what made America great . “ I believe that at this moment we all face a choice , ” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border . “ We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion . I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back. ” While I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature , which George Washington acknowledged we should do , I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that . His idea is to reward bad behavior , even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States . That is not only unconstitutional , it ’ s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things . Yet , Congress and the people have allowed him to do it . Finally , Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation . No , it was not . The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists , Socialists or Islamists . There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least . As a friend of mine aptly stated , “ They ( the founders of the UN ) ’ the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake. ” This is not the first time Obama has pushed this globalist mentality either .

"S Trump ’ s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination .

Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA . Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel , who despises the First Amendment ’ s protections , anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy . Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump ’ s campaign later denied the report . Vanity Fair noted that : According to the lawsuit , Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions : 73 percent of those who applied were Asian . Ultimately , the lawsuit says , the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians . “ The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion , ” the lawsuit says . Ironically , Peter Thiel , the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee ’ s most unlikely supporter , is himself a PayPal generation immigrant . Thiel ’ s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field , but now he ’ s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether . Thiel was a first co-founder and early Facebook investor , but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year . The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan ’ s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker , in retaliation for revealing the billionaire ’ s then-secret sexual orientation . But now , the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company , after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . Thiel then called out the GOP ’ s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said , “ Every American has a unique identity . I ’ m proud to be gay , I ’ m proud to be a Republican , ” after a lengthy rant against “ government incompetence. ” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais , and only the second speaker to be openly gay period . Unfortunately , his own party didn ’ t pay much attention to the speech , which was surprisingly well received inside the hall ( as you can see below ) , because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year , which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s . “ Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination , ” said the Department of Labor ’ s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu . “ Our nation ’ s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers. ” Lisa Gordon , a spokeswoman for Palantir , said the company will defend itself “ vigorously ” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News . Now , the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company ’ s hiring practices were competent , in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary .",1
"“ Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years , ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people. ” —Dan Stein , President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , they have charged that the Obama administration “ grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold ” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal , criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014 . Now , if the term “ illegal , criminal aliens ” sounds like overkill , understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally , which makes them criminals . However , applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated , but not deported . “ In response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015 , ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released , instead of deported , in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses , ” read FAIR ’ s press release . “ However , the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute ( IRLI ) on FAIR ’ s behalf show that the actual number of only subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288 . It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions . Thus , the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater. ” “ The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE ’ s self-declared ‘ priorities ’ for removal , ” the press release added . “ The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes : homicide , kidnapping , assault , sexual assault , drunk driving , and other offenses . Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes , ICE doubled down in FY 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals. ” “ In recent years , the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted make , despite ample funds to remove many more . As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the American public , thousands of people have been needlessly victimized , ” charged Dan Stein , president of FAIR . “ Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years , ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people , ” added Stein . “ Moreover , despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing , DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police. ” “ Congress has to act . It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain , ” Stein concluded . In March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security . They were not deported . In fact , so-called “ sanctuary cities ” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported , but never were . In 2014 , it was also reported the administration released 75 % of illegals rather than deport them . It appears to me that DHS needs to be renamed the Department of Homeland IN-Security .

"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City , Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter ’ s apartment seeming like a new mustiness person . Too new to be believed as a matter of fact , since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton ’ s apartment was noticeably well and energetic . Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter , more vibrant , and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment . The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past . The different nose is a dead giveaway , in the identification of nose types , the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose , which is quite common and straight . The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge , this being more of a Roman type . Aside from the different nose types , the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent . Hillary ’ s stand in also has no mole above her right lip , Hillary Clinton does . Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning , we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election , aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself . The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is , will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up ? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates ? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance . If she appears to be much thinner , younger , or without a cough and hoarseness , we should know , this is not the real Hillary Clinton . If she appears to be right on the mark , without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness , this is the clone , not Hillary Clinton . The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is , will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States ? Or will her double conduct all public appearances , meetings with foreign dignitaries , State of the Union addresses , and speeches ? It could be possible that if she wins the election , it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect , including the Swearing In . It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration adenine and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity . If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is , such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential . The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed , to accept an idea as President . Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead , or an idea , but not in charge of anything .

"One does not ingest to bleed red , white and blue in order to live in this country . However , whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “ enlightened ” political correctness , I always wonder , “ If you hate what this country stands for , then why do you live here ? ” That ’ s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event ’ s “ American theme ” because it is supposedly offensive . Students at Ramapo College in Mahwah , New Jersey , were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty . The theme was “ America. ” As students made preparations for the event , however , they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “ offensive. ” The staffer who issued the edict , Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director ariana Rivera , claimed that , among other things , the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “ military and recruitment-oriented. ” Because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army ? Doubtful… Rivera claimed that the order came from the administration . When asked who was issuing the order , she replied , “ To be honest , I ’ m not sure . I think it was administrative . I was told that our advertising was besides ‘ military and recruitment-oriented , ’ because we had the Uncle Sam saying ‘ I want you. ’ I think ? However , we saw other posters with that same idea , so I really don ’ t know. ” The event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance . College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “ miscommunication. ” Still , students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place . In either case , what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism , but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why . “ Because we said so ” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants .",1
"Progressive Democrats are the “ helicopter parents ” of America . They want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good , and it ’ s keeping segments of the American population from being fully independent . This is NOT what our Founders envisioned when they set out to create our government . One of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks . Don ’ t believe me ? Just ask Thomas Sowell , who penned an amazing piece for National Review on this very subject . Back in the 1960s , as large numbers of black students were entering a certain Ivy League university for the first time , someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was . He said , “ I give them all A ’ s and B ’ s . To hell with them. ” Since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students , he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades , and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students , but also from the administration . He was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career . He also knew that his “ favor ” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run , because they wouldn ’ t know what they were supposed to know . Such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words . Nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics . But many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “ favors ” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run . Sowell continues his piece , lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “ welfare state , ” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen . In 1960 , before this expansion of the welfare state , 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent . By 1985 , 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent . A big “ favor ” the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led scan to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining ignominious of other categories of students .

"Federal prosecutors began the first “ Bridgegate ” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week . At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media . Even though Christie isn ’ t a defendant in today ’ s court action , the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation , as NJ.com reported : U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna , describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9 , 2013 , said David Wildstein , a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year , will admit he was the one who came up with that idea . The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni narrate Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan . “ The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor , they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned . This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee , ” said Khanna . Last year , Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate , but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one , the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable , no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonald ’ s . Federal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni , the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , and Bridget Anne Kelly , who was Governor Christie ’ s deputy chief of staff . The only thing that the defense , prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon , is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinates ’ political retribution against a local mayor . In fact , defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect Christie ’ s now tarnished political career , because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign : Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie , a Republican , and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor ’ s political aspirations — saying their clients were “ thrown under the presidential bus , ” as one lawyer argued on Monday . But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie . And it directly contradicts the governor ’ s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed , paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee , N.J. As usual , the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris Christie ’ s prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate . We uncovered this extraordinary video where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything . For years , Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New york and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration . From the sound of federal prosecutors , it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their clench to serve Christie notice , and he ’ s the most likely final target of this prosecution . Watch his shame :",1
"President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal . Their is no denying that . Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act , gun control , and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees . Well apparently he agree not changed his tune . Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President . While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at . During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order . Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome . He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions , such as the United Nations for example . Obama said that the only freedom we should not noted to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves . But apparently he have everything else is basically up for grabs . He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right . I hope he ’ s enjoying that Gilligan ’ s Island by himself . How ridiculous ! He knows his constituents do not has with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise . That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now . If the leader of our country can not broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so . It ’ s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do . Then they wonder why they misbehave .

"“ I ’ ve never seen anything like this . He ’ s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising. ” — A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become the Republican version of Barack Obama . Over the weekend , Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York . For his efforts he was attacked , criticized , and derided by liberals and their partners in the media . As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ( D-NY ) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ( D-NY ) refused to call the terrorism what it was , Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his “ rhetoric. ” Arguing that by talking tough , Mr. Trump was somehow giving “ aid and comfort to the enemy. ” “ I don ’ t want to speculate but here ’ s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November , ” Clinton said . “ We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists. “ Clinton says Trump 's rhetoric has `` given aid and comfort '' to terrorists . Phrase is definition of treason . — Zeke Miller ( @ ZekeJMiller ) September 19 , 2016 In fact , the left , almost as one , decried Trump ’ s comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks . However , most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump , and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize that Trump ’ s early comments were correct . We don ’ t yet know scuttlebutt how the weekend ’ s events will play into the upcoming election , but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic . Fundraising for example . Donald Trump has already , with 7 live weeks left before Election Day , outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among “ small donors. ” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $ 100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $ 200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months . Trump ’ s campaign has surpassed a “ threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign , ” according to Politico , which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign ’ s fundraising efforts .

"Drugs can be a hell of a way to ruin your life . It takes a hold of your life , turns it upside down and very rarely ever lets you go . Another drug that has taken the streets by storm is the drug SPICE…otherwise known as K2 . Its toted as giving the same effects that marijuana does , but it ’ s synthetically made , so it doesn ’ t occur naturally . Also , a small detail to this drug is that it completely drives the user batshit crazy ! There have been multiple reports of the drug being used on the streets , with the results being bodies of people completely strung out , laying around on the roads and sidewalks . Now of course there are a plethora of different types of the drug , all ranging in different highs . The user themselves matter as well , with some claiming that the high is just as good as marijuana , without any real adverse effects…then there are others , like this guy , who have complete nightmares… In the case of this man , he believed he was receiving cannabis straight out…no doubt he was familiar with it as he stated : ‘ Don ’ ampere t tell me how to smoke weed , man ’ . He had no idea what he was actually smoking was indeed spice . This led to his elevated mood at first , relaxation and then ultimately an altered perception of reality…this was supposed to be a joke…I ’ m sure everyone that cares about him is just laughing their heads off about it . The mean was seen stumbling and falling all around , while the wastes of life were laughing and taking their sick advantage of the situation . The video ends with him completely laid out on the ground , with the idiots around him mumbling and walking off . Drugs are a hell of a freak show when someone is under their influence . Best to take this video as a reminder to stay away from this also particular one…if you don ’ t want to see your skin melt right off of you .",1

"( Via JewsNews ) Quebec mayor gives Muslim ârefugeesâ a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians donât adapt to them , itâs the other way around . â MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA , ITS CUSTOMS , ITS TRADITIONS , ITS WAY OF LIFE , BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE . YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA . NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE IT THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE , NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM . YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC . WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS , IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS , CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS . FOR THIS REASON , THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE . FINALLY , THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA , WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS , CHRISTMAS TREES , CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS , RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE . THE CANADA OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW . FOR MUSLIMS , WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA , THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD , MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS , IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW . IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO MUNICIPALITY , AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY , IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES . HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION , JUST ONCE : WHY IS FOR BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM . It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives . This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans . Because Muslims can not eat a particular meal , should mean they should bring their own . The few should never out weigh the many , especially when it comes to adopted culture . Adopt it , or don ’ t . Just do block others from it . Gernot Trolf Mar 28 , 2016 at 1:12 pm The Prime Minister of Australia said much the same and I agree with you both wholeheartedly . Spread the word . Adapt or leave",1
"Liberals like to talk about the secret figures funding the Republican party , but they have one of their own . George Soros has been funding leftist groups for decades , from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter . Rumors of voter fraud have followed him for a long time and it appears that he ’ s gearing up to do it again . A new campaign has debuted that claims it will end Trump ’ s campaign . Called the “ October surprise that will end Trump , ” the campaign says it will activate a “ secret swing state ” of over 8 million unregistered voters abroad , made up of both American expats and “ backing global citizens. ” The 8 million Americans abroad almost never vote . This dead easy tool can fix that but only if we make it famous : https : //t.co/z4l7lekdub — Avaaz ( @ Avaaz ) September 13 , 2016 Interestingly , the campaign wasn ’ t launched in the United States , but in London . Avaaz is a registered charity in the United States and is also one of the world ’ s most powerful activist groups — and , surprise ! , has links to George Soros . The activists behind the campaign drove from University College London to Parliament in an open top bus , blasting Bruce Springsteen ’ s “ Born in the USA ” while yelling “ Don ’ t vote Trump ! ” . It is illegal in the United States for registered charities to work with or for any presidential candidate , and Avaaz denies having any connection to the Hillary Clinton campaign . They were recorded yelling “ Vote for Hillary ! ” , though . “ Avaaz has created the world ’ s first , global , citizen ’ s get-out-the-vote drive , ” a member of Avaaz explained . “ The more people that share it on Facebook , the more Americans abroad will see it , and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump. ” The view for the top of the @ Avaaz Stop Trump battle bus in London . American music , balloons , flags & chanting @ LBC pic.twitter.com/slsTFdQti3 — Rachael Venables ( @ rachaelvenables ) September 21 , 2016 Avaaz chose to kick off their campaign in south London because it has the largest concentration of American expats and created a new tool designed to show them how easy it was to register to vote . 88 % of Americans living overseas did not register to vote in the last presidential election and Avaaz believes that this voting bloc would be mostly progressive . Over half of American expats in the United Kingdom have Master ’ s degrees and overwhelmingly donate to Democratic candidates . But it ’ s not just Americans living in Europe they ’ re reaching out to — their next campaign is in Mexico . 1 million Americans in Mexico can stop # Trump 's wall ! # GringosAVotar campaign kicks off Sun 9/25 in Mexico City : https : //t.co/Q68FjjJk7d pic.twitter.com/6tv7CES8Cy — Avaaz ( @ Avaaz ) September 21 , 2016 Will the Soros machine be able to stop the Trump campaign ’ s momentum ?",1
