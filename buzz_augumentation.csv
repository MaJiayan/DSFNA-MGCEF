"They don’t call CNN the Clinton News Network for no reason. The network has long been seen as a loyal supporter of the former president, always ready to shield her from scrutiny and suppress any damaging information. During a heated debate on the air, CNN’s Chris Cuomo — brother of New York’s governor — clashed with one of Donald Trump’s top advisors, Boris Epshteyn. Cuomo insisted that Trump should address the birther controversy just as Hillary Clinton faced consequences for her private email server. “With Hillary, she had to take responsibility for the server,” Cuomo said. “It was a mistake. People around her said it was wrong, that she shouldn’t have done it, that it was poorly handled. But it wasn’t enough. Why?” Epshteyn countered that the situations were not comparable. “There’s no comparison. Hillary Clinton broke the law.” Cuomo pushed back, asking if James Comey was also lying. Epshteyn replied that Comey had stated there was a case to be made. “He said she was careless, and as a lawyer, he believed there was a basis for prosecution,” he said. Cuomo denied this, claiming Comey had said there was no case. “He said it wasn’t even close,” Cuomo insisted. “But the FBI director himself said that mishandling classified information is a felony — whether intentional or grossly negligent. Isn’t that exactly what Hillary did? Comey called her ‘extremely careless’ — which means gross negligence. And let’s not forget she had over a dozen personal devices along with her private server, which stored classified material.”

"What's behind the News Media's silence on the recent violent attacks in our cities? I only found out about the shootings and explosions through a viral post online. You'd expect these incidents to be front-page news across all major networks, wouldn't you? Maybe there's a video circulating that's influencing the events. I'm certain Hillary Clinton wants you to think Donald Trump is directly responsible for this surge in extremism in the U.S. She's been hinting at it pretty clearly. These attacks can't possibly be linked to Obama's immigration failures—oh no, the very same policies that Hillary plans to push forward without hesitation. It's possible the media is downplaying the stories to avoid casting any suspicion on Crooked Hillary. CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, and even FOX would never be used as a tool to support Crooked Hillary, right? What kind of un-American person would question the honesty of today's media? Where has our country gone? The news we're shown now feels like propaganda, similar to what people in the old Soviet Union were forced to watch. They twist the facts just enough to trick the public, mixing in some truth to make it believable. Pure deception. Anyone with common sense can see through this.",1
"The Democratic push to hold the IRS commissioner accountable for…something… backfired dramatically when Republicans, offended by being dragged into a partisan spectacle, turned the tables. During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s testimony, Republicans tried to focus on the so-called “impeachment” of the agency, but Democrats seized the moment to dig deeper into Donald Trump’s financial misconduct, including his refusal to release tax returns and allegations of tax evasion. A key point of contention was Trump's claim that he can't release his returns because they're under audit. Tax experts have consistently dismissed this excuse, pointing out that an audit doesn’t prevent someone from sharing their records with the public before an election. The IRS chief, who should know better, confirmed this. “Is there anything preventing someone from releasing their tax returns if they want to during an audit?” asked Rep. Jerry Nadler. “No,” Koskinen replied. Another Democrat rephrased the question: “Would releasing the returns interfere with the audit process?” “Not directly,” Koskinen said. “But taxpayers sometimes worry that making information public could lead to more scrutiny or discoveries.” In short, Trump is likely afraid that releasing his taxes might expose something damaging — or let journalists uncover more dirt that the IRS missed. This aligns with what Trump’s son once told reporters, suggesting that it’s not the audit itself that worries him, but the possibility of revealing incriminating details. It may be why Trump has hinted at waiting until after the election to release his returns — though it would be too late by then. As the hearing continued, Democrats pressed Koskinen on potential issues in Trump’s finances, such as his real income, actual tax payments, net worth, and charitable activities. Rep. Zoe Lofgren questioned whether Russian money could have influenced Trump’s policies. Others brought up reports of Trump using his tax-exempt foundation to buy art, fund campaigns, and cover business costs. “Is it ethical for a charity to make political donations?” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, chewing on Skittles during the session, seemed to enjoy the Republican discomfort, referencing Trump Jr.’s recent comment comparing refugees to poisoned candy. He later joked that he wouldn’t stop eating them even if one was bad. It was a tough day for GOP lawmakers. The IRS commissioner was caught in a Republican-led impeachment effort over alleged IRS bias against conservative groups. The problem?",1
"During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump claimed he never sought support from Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino expansion, saying, “He would’ve given it to me if I wanted it.” But if that’s true, then Trump may have committed another serious legal violation—this time for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is considered perjury, as reported by *Newsweek*. One of these accounts is clearly fabricated—a self-serving story designed to protect his image. Unlike the many falsehoods he has spread, this one reveals a pattern: Trump fabricates stories when he doesn’t want to admit he lost. Assume the debate statement is the lie. Even though Bush’s version aligned with what Trump had been saying at rallies—that he played the “money for favors” game for years—he couldn’t admit he had tried the same in Florida because he couldn’t bring himself to say he had failed. Instead, he looked the American public in the eye and lied. Then he added another boast: His team is so powerful they would have won the casino deal in Florida regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below reveal a factual dispute between two candidates, but not just any fact—something both men should have known. After Trump’s failed attempt to push gambling into Florida against the wishes of an anti-gambling Republican governor, he sued a former employee over his own failure. Eichenwald suggests that either Trump lied directly to a former official on live TV (and the moderators let him get away with it), or: Consider the other possibility—that Trump committed perjury during his 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but claimed he didn’t get it because he was tricked by Fields. The motive for the false testimony is clear—Trump wants money from someone who stopped working for him, and this story lets him avoid admitting he’s anything less than perfect. Why does this matter? In the 1990s, House Republicans impeached President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying under oath about a personal matter. The media fixated on the Whitewater scandal for years, making it the central issue of the time. Now, Republicans are backing a candidate known for his lies, but unlike his usual fabrications, this one either involved lying to a Florida court under oath (which seems to be a common venue for Trump) or lying to a national audience and his party",1
"Trump once again took to the stage tonight to repeat one of his go-to fear tactics: claiming that crime is spiraling out of control in major American cities. He specifically pointed to Detroit — which he repeatedly called “Obama’s city” — as a prime example of lawlessness and chaos. However, the reality is that crime rates across all categories have been steadily dropping for over 15 years. While there has been a slight rise in homicides in some urban areas recently, this increase is not statistically significant when compared to past decades. In fact, Detroit has seen a consistent decline in crime since the early 2000s. Although there has been a recent uptick in murder rates, this year’s numbers still fall far below the more than 600 murders recorded during the early Bush era, let alone the over 1,000 annual killings in the 1990s. Under President Obama, Detroit experienced its lowest levels of violent crime in decades. This trend mirrors national patterns, as violent crime has been on a clear downward trajectory since the 1990s. Despite these facts, Trump continues to weaponize fear and misinformation to rally his base. During last night’s debate, he once again used the classic rhetoric of an authoritarian figure: “We need law and order.” And as always, Trump shows no concern for the truth when it conflicts with his agenda.",1
"When Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration until we understand the threat, every Democrat and liberal commentator screamed that it was discriminatory. But they were—and still are—completely mistaken. Racism is the belief that one race is superior to another based solely on skin color. Islam, however, is a religion that has been exploited by extremists who carry out suicide bombings in crowded places, convinced they will be rewarded with 72 virgins in paradise. The real danger lies not with those calling for caution, but with those who ignore the reality of radicalization. After witnessing global instability, Trump sought a pause on Muslim immigration until we can secure our borders against terrorist infiltration. Democrats, however, believe the world will support their stance, which is simply not true.  

A recent survey revealed that 48% of voters support a national discussion on the topic, with two-thirds of Australians agreeing that populist politician Pauline Hanson raises issues that others avoid. The main concerns were fears of terrorism and the belief that Muslim immigrants don’t assimilate or embrace local values. The poll was conducted twice to confirm its accuracy. So, Australians want to protect their culture? That’s nothing new—every nation does the same. Yet, when Trump says “America first,” it's suddenly racist. That logic doesn’t hold.  

Sixty percent of Coalition supporters back an end to Muslim migration, along with 40% of Labor voters and 34% of Green voters. The pollster was stunned by the results, admitting that what he once called the “basket of deplorables” is now too large to dismiss. He wrote, “This isn’t a fringe group outside of polite society—it’s 49% of the population.” While they’re more likely to support the Coalition or independent candidates, 40% of Labor voters and a third of Greens also agree. These people are in your office, on your street, on your train—people who disagree with the mainstream narrative.  

Hillary, this is how you should respond to those who oppose you: not by labeling them “deplorables,” but by acknowledging that half the country stands against you. Let’s get this done in November. (Source: Breitbart)",1
"Update: According to a recent report, our account of the incident and the individuals involved has been labeled misleading by a well-known news outlet. We have thoroughly refuted their allegations. You can read our detailed response here. ~~~ You really can't make this up. In the past, people would share wild tales, but there was no real way to verify if they were true. Then came video. This is definitely one of the most shocking things I've ever seen. These individuals were in the middle of the street, and it looked like a confrontation was about to happen. After all, fights are always more intense when they take place on a busy road. Suddenly, someone throws a firebomb at them. LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE. And they're running around in the middle of traffic, completely panicked, risking getting hit by a car. Pure madness, and easily one of the worst things I've witnessed since the O.J. Simpson trial. What kind of twisted mind would think — hey, now's the perfect time to set these people on fire? Yeah, let's just throw that flaming bottle over there and watch them burn. Who even carries the materials for a Molotov cocktail? Was this planned? It's not like I keep those ingredients lying around unless it's for a fancy drink on a weekend. Back in the old days, when people were more responsible and society was better, things would have been different. If two people were about to fight in the street, the decent folks would step in to protect them from traffic and ensure the fight stayed fair. That was when people had more sense and cared about each other. Now, everyone grabs their phone and turns a minor issue into a viral disaster just for likes and views. No one cares anymore. It's time to start caring about people and stop setting them on fire.",1
"To anyone watching last night’s debate, it was obvious that Donald Trump outperformed Hillary Clinton. Sure, Hillary is a seasoned politician, but Trump clearly exposed her inconsistencies in front of a national audience. Despite this, CNN tried to spin the narrative by releasing biased polling data that suggested Clinton had the upper hand. According to Infowars: A CNN/ORC poll released right after the debate claimed Hillary Clinton won the showdown against Trump. The issue? The survey had 43% Democrats and only 25% Republicans. When asked, “Who did better in the debate — Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?” 64% picked Hillary, while 26% chose Trump. This immediately painted the picture that Clinton dominated the exchange and fueled the media's story that Trump had a poor performance. However, 31% of respondents were Independents, 43% were Democrats, and just 25% were Republicans — a 18% gap between the two major parties. That means the poll was skewed heavily toward Democratic voters before even asking who won. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed weren’t Republicans, and there were 68% more Democrats than Republicans in the sample. If the numbers were reversed — 43% Republicans and 25% Democrats — the results would likely have favored Trump. You get the idea…Donald absolutely crushed Hillary in the debate!",1
"When Republicans chose a candidate who vowed to stop pandering to the wealthy, they had no idea their presidential pick would actually hand power over America’s most important government agencies to the same elite billionaires. Reports suggest that Donald Trump is considering naming energy mogul Rebecca Hart as Secretary of the Interior, breaking the decades-old tradition of selecting officials from rural Western states to oversee the management of national parks, public lands, and wildlife. This move could be catastrophic for environmental protection, especially regarding the Endangered Species Act, climate change mitigation, and animal welfare, as Rebecca Hart has a history of opposing regulations that limit industrial exploitation of natural resources. According to The Daily Beast, Hart, who owns a large energy company and sits on Trump’s economic advisory board, has funded organizations that attack animal rights groups like the ASPCA and oppose restrictions on factory farming, hunting, and animal entertainment. A source close to the transition team confirmed that Hart was among a small group of candidates under consideration for the role, which has drawn attention from influential anti-environmentalists. In a clear sign of the administration's potential corruption, it was also reported that Trump’s daughter Ivanka is being seriously considered for a top position in the Department of the Interior. The Interior Department controls 28% of U.S. land, oversees national parks, forests, and federal wildlife services, and plays a key role in regulating tribal gaming and mineral leasing on public lands. Its decisions impact everything from oil drilling to water rights, making it one of the most powerful agencies in the federal government. The National Wildlife Federation has raised alarms about the implications of Trump’s selection: “Putting an energy magnate in charge of our public lands and coastal areas is a direct threat to the environment and a promise that drilling will expand dramatically if he wins.” Hart has previously worked against legislation aimed at curbing factory farming practices and has supported policies that weaken animal protection laws. It's alarming to see how Trump is offering high-profile government roles to figures whose agendas directly contradict the public interest. If the options are either a corporate-backed oil executive who sees nature as a resource to be exploited or a privileged, far-right figure with a taste for violence and destruction, it's hard not to wonder if this is all staged. But make no mistake — Trump is dead serious, and his plans pose a real danger to the future of the country.",1
"Trump once again took to the stage tonight to repeat one of his go-to fear tactics: claiming that crime is spiraling out of control in major American cities. He specifically pointed to Chicago — a city he repeatedly called “Obama’s home” — as evidence of a violent crisis. However, the reality is that crime rates across all categories have been steadily dropping for over 15 years. While there has been a slight increase in homicides in some urban areas recently, this rise is not statistically significant when compared to past decades. In fact, Chicago's crime levels, both violent and non-violent, have been on a downward trend since around 2001. Although there has been a recent uptick in murders, this year’s numbers still fall well below the 700-plus killings recorded during the early Bush era, let alone the nearly 1,000 annual murders seen in the 1990s. Under President Obama, Chicago experienced its lowest murder and violent crime rates in decades. This decline mirrors national patterns, with violent crime across the country dropping sharply since the 1990s. Despite these clear trends, Trump continues to weaponize fear and misinformation to rally his base. During last night’s debate, he echoed a familiar authoritarian refrain: “We need law and order.” For Trump, facts are simply obstacles to his agenda of division and deception.",1
"Hillary Clinton was widely hailed as the victor of last night’s debate by major news outlets, yet social media sentiment told a different story. The #TrumpWon hashtag quickly gained traction and became the top trending topic across Twitter. As of now, #TrumpWon is the number one trend in the U.S.—thanks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016. What's surprising isn't just the trend itself, but its origin. According to Trendsmap.com, the #TrumpWon hashtag first appeared in Saint Petersburg, Russia—home to a network of state-sponsored cyber-trolls working under Putin's direction as part of a broader disinformation strategy called dezinformatsiya. This is a well-known tactic used to stir up public unrest, deepen political divides, and undermine trust in democratic institutions. Russian operatives have previously been caught flooding American platforms with pro-Trump content, while Russian media has actively promoted him to European audiences. Putin’s goal is clear: he wants a Trump presidency that could ease the economic pressure on his allies and allow for greater Russian influence in Eastern Europe. Former trolls who worked in these operations described their environment as highly controlled and stressful, with strict quotas and harsh penalties for non-compliance. They worked in small groups under constant supervision, with little autonomy and minimal pay. So next time you see a viral hashtag or online poll, think twice—what you're reading might just be the work of a low-paid internet worker in a dimly lit room, trying to make ends meet.",1
"Charlotte rioters gang attacked a man in a downtown parking lot for a shocking reason – the man was white! WHY ELSE WOULD A GROUP OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS ATTACK A RANDOM WHITE GUY? The white man was likely there for work, or visiting someone, but that doesn’t matter. The Black Lives Matter crowd has no interest in working or contributing. They’d rather spend their time causing chaos, looting, and attacking innocent people whenever a cop shoots someone. This particular incident has nothing to do with the death of Keith Lamont Scott or any other black person killed by police. Even if a black officer kills a black suspect, it’s still used as an excuse to justify violence. This is what people now call “thug behavior” and it’s disgraceful. Hannity – While many acts of violence have been reported during the Charlotte protests, one particularly disturbing video shows an unidentified man being beaten and dragged across the pavement as he pleads for his life. The attack occurred in the parking garage of a downtown mall. This isn't what it means to be American. It's not about race — it's about choice. There are so many positive black Americans who deserve recognition, but every time riots break out, the good ones get overshadowed by the bad. It's time for the African American community to take responsibility and stop enabling these violent thugs. #CharlotteRiots Man beaten in parking lot begs for mercy. @AC360 @seanhannity @BretBaier Credit:Lenard Bennett (facebook) @ncnaacp pic.twitter.com/YWHEU2UV1n — Libertarian Queen (@LibertarianQn) September 22, 2016  Call out the thugs for their senseless violence. People like those in this video bring shame upon their entire community. Stand up to them and don’t let them define your culture or your identity.

Good people will always rise above the thugs. Don’t let the losers hold you back.",1
"Really? Hillary Clinton is now claiming she’s going to fight racism, and she’s beginning with our Police Officers? This woman is out of her mind. I’m speechless at how absurd this is…because it’s just plain ridiculous! She’s making all the wrong moves, trying desperately to gain support. The so-called ‘racism’ problem doesn’t start with Police Officers or white people… This woman has completely lost it. “We need to address the systemic racism, this terrible shooting again, how many more times do we have to see this in America?” she said during an interview on the Tom Joyner Show. Clinton was specifically talking about the police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, insisting he had his “hands up” when he was killed. “This is unacceptable and must be stopped,” she said. Clinton told Joyner that if the African-American community supported her, she would work to prevent racialized police shootings. “Maybe I can speak directly to white people and say, ‘This isn’t who we are,’” she added. “We need to fix policing, tackle implicit bias head-on. Actually Hillary… what we really need is to stop electing divisive, self-serving, corrupt people into the White House… who stir up chaos just to appear as saviors with nonsense like this. She wants this mess, Obama wanted this mess. It's creating a breeding ground for stupidity, and they want the American people to stay ignorant so they can keep controlling everything.”",1
"A Daisy of a New Era  
I’ve seen my share of political tricks, but nothing quite compares to the original ""Daisy"" ad from 1964—a haunting image of a young girl plucking daisy petals while a nuclear explosion looms in the background. It was a masterstroke of fearmongering, orchestrated by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign to paint his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a warmonger. The irony? Johnson himself escalated the Vietnam War, making him the very thing he accused Goldwater of being. Today, as history struggles to reconcile Johnson’s legacy, Goldwater is often seen as the victim of a political smear that has since been quietly buried.  

This brings me to our current election cycle. There are whispers that a new ""Daisy"" ad could be crafted, not to target Trump this time, but to highlight the failures of another candidate—Hillary Clinton. Imagine that same child, picking petals for every misstep in her career. Such a commercial could be devastating to her campaign. Of course, it’s unlikely to ever see the light of day, but rumors suggest some within the Clinton team are considering similar tactics.  

Meanwhile, the media continues to play its part, often burying critical information deep in articles or letting damaging stories fade quickly. This bias is so ingrained that “liberal press” has become an accepted label. As the first debate approaches, the same tired moderators will be in charge, with no real change in their approach. It’s hard not to notice that many of them have shifted their stance, now supporting candidates they once criticized.  

Take, for example, the 2008 primary when Barack Obama called Hillary Clinton “untrustworthy” and “unqualified.” That was before her tenure as Secretary of State and the Benghazi scandal. Now, with her running for president again, those early words seem almost prophetic. Even Michelle Obama’s famous line about “running your own house” still echoes today, though it’s rarely brought up in the mainstream press.  

If only there were a way to reframe the past, to show each petal as a documented failure. It might be more powerful than the original “Daisy” ad, which relied on fear rather than facts.

"Terrorism seems to be causing more confusion than fear, I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb explodes in the U.S. or when the phrase Allahu Akbar is shouted during a mass shooting. I heard a Chicago mayor claim that the explosion at the airport had nothing to do with the one in the subway on the same day. I suppose the FBI could take a lesson from this mayor. A reporter on CNN suggested the bomb might have been a gas canister accidentally left in a trash bin. The media will bring in so-called experts and offer countless opinions on something that doesn’t need any explanation other than one simple truth. These extremists are going to destroy us unless we act first. When law enforcement captures or kills one, I don’t care about his background that the news always highlights to create a dramatic story. The only thing that matters is punishing him quickly, without letting him enjoy a comfortable prison life with access to Muslim food, free healthcare, gym facilities, a TV to watch terrorist acts around the world, and a Quran with a prayer mat. Terrorists should be tried within 30 days of capture and given their sentence in the same timeframe. I’m just an average person, and I’d rather form my own views instead of letting the media shape them for me. After all, who wants to be misled?",1

I won’t make the same mistake next time. I did it because I can’t stand how society treats people like me. I’m part of the LGBTQ+ community, and we’re still seen as mentally ill, sinful, or just weird. It’s 2016, and this kind of discrimination is still happening. I won’t sit back while marginalized groups are oppressed. I won’t stand by while racism and bigotry continue to run rampant, especially when it comes to white police officers across the country. I won’t live in a country where a misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, and Islamophobic Republican candidate is even considered for president. Republicans are all privileged, cisgendered white people who don’t deserve to be taken seriously. This isn’t the end — it’s only the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a change. I will take out my targets before it's too late. Someone is lying, and it's disgusting that anyone would try to claim this, especially someone who wasn’t even involved.

"Local Charlotte, NC news outlet WSOCTV is reporting that eyewitnesses say dash camera footage shows Keith Scott exiting his vehicle and approaching officers with a weapon in hand: #BREAKING: Eyewitnesses tell Channel 9 dash camera video shows #KeithScott exiting car, walking toward officers with gun in hand pic.twitter.com/GGuM2Ow3wk — WSOCTV (@wsoctv) September 21, 2016  For a second night, protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, following a fatal police shooting, with clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Keith Lamont Scott, a father of seven, was shot by police in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday while officers were searching for a man named in a warrant. The incident sparked hours of unrest, and on Wednesday, the demonstrations continued into a second night, beginning as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte. As the crowd moved toward an Omni Hotel, some individuals climbed onto the roof of a nearby mall and began throwing objects at the group. Others attempted to break into the hotel, prompting police in full riot gear to intervene. Scott’s family claims he was unarmed and seated in his car reading a book, waiting for his son to return from school. However, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney stated that Scott left his vehicle with a gun, not a book, and that no book was found at the scene. “It’s time for the voiceless majority to speak out,” said the black police chief. “It’s time to reshape the story because I can tell you from the facts that the account so far is not entirely accurate, especially on social media.” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book?

"Hillary Clinton seized the opening presidential debate of the general election cycle to aggressively confront Donald Trump, provoking him on issues like his financial history, tax practices, gender attitudes, racial rhetoric, business ethics, and personal integrity. If Clinton was seeking a showdown, she certainly got one. Her sharp tone drew Trump into several heated exchanges, where he revealed moments of frustration that reflected both public discontent and his more abrasive public image. The debate featured several intense moments, with Trump’s tone growing increasingly pointed. “She doesn’t look the part,” Trump remarked toward the end. “She doesn’t have the strength.” At times, Trump seemed unsettled, especially as the discussion progressed. However, his primary criticisms of Clinton were based on policy, as he aimed to represent the frustrations of voters not only with Clinton but with the political establishment as a whole. “You’ve been in power for 30 years — why are you only now coming up with these solutions?” Trump asked during a segment on job creation. “I’ve thought about this a lot,” Clinton replied. “Yeah, for 30 years,” Trump shot back. Trump distorted facts and questioned Clinton's character, though he largely maintained his composure. Throughout the debate, Clinton addressed Trump by his first name, while he consistently called her “Secretary Clinton” and made it clear he was fine with that. “I want you to be very comfortable. It’s important to me,” Trump said, once again challenging fact-checkers. Trump faced his most difficult moment when moderator Lester Holt brought up the question of President Obama’s birthplace — specifically why it took Trump until just weeks before the debate to acknowledge it was settled. Trump simply stated, “I say nothing” to those questioning why he pursued the issue for so long. He also falsely claimed Clinton started the birther controversy in 2007, taking credit for ending it. “Just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce Obama’s birth certificate,” Trump said. Clinton seized on an issue that resonated with African American voters and other members of the Obama coalition. “This can’t be dismissed so easily. He built his political career on this racist lie that our first black president wasn’t a citizen,” she said. “The birther lie was deeply hurtful.” Concerned that Trump might behave more politely, Clinton launched her attacks early, suggesting that his success came from privilege and that he was hiding his tax returns to avoid scrutiny. “Maybe",1
"In the past few days, the long-debated ""Birther"" claims about former President Barack Obama have resurfaced. This time, it's candidate Donald Trump who is pushing back, insisting that Obama was born in the U.S. — full stop. You know the one: the claim that Obama was actually born in Kenya, making him ineligible for the presidency. This narrative first gained traction during the 2007 and 2008 presidential campaigns, with the Hillary Clinton team subtly hinting at it. In fact, it was not Trump who initially stoked these fires — he just amplified them to new extremes. 

Back in 2007, Hillary’s campaign strategist, Mark Penn, wrote a memo suggesting ways to exploit Obama’s background. He noted that Obama’s “roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited” and advised Clinton to emphasize her own “deeply American” upbringing. He even suggested using flag imagery and repeatedly highlighting her “middle-class” origins in speeches. The goal was to position Clinton as the true representative of American values, contrasting her with Obama.

This is clearly a distraction — a tired old tactic used to shift focus from more pressing issues. After nearly eight years of Obama’s leadership, bringing up this non-issue again feels pointless. But then again, that’s probably the whole idea. Anything to keep the spotlight off the real problems. For more on this, visit www.iPatriot.com.

"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. CNN (and increasingly, the other news networks) have been fueling anxiety for so long that they've turned into the very thing they claim to oppose. Pope Francis agrees. Echoing Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous phrase, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope criticized media that spreads fear. Journalism built on speculation or unverified claims is a form of “violence,” and outlets that generalize entire groups or stir up panic about immigrants are acting irresponsibly, Pope Francis said on Wednesday. Spreading false information is an example of “terrorism, of how you can harm someone with your words,” he stated. “This is especially dangerous for journalists because their words can reach millions and that’s a powerful tool.” Source: Reuters Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Spain and addressing Spanish media, which has its own issues with right-wing rhetoric, but I’m sure he hoped his message would cross the Atlantic. After all, CNN often focuses on fear and that’s what has led to the rise of figures like Donald Trump. Crime in the country is actually decreasing. The chance of an American being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million — about the same as being injured by your own household items. Still, Trump, encouraged by CNN, is making Americans terrified: Fear is everywhere, and it's growing. Americans are more anxious than they've been in years, according to polls showing large majorities worried about terrorism and crime, with these numbers rising to levels not seen in over a decade. Every week seems to bring a new incident, whether domestic or international. Mass shootings continue to happen regularly. Protests have disrupted major cities, and some have turned violent. While overall crime may be down, a feeling of chaos remains constant. Source: The Atlantic Sure, that’s about Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly referring to him, but CNN is the fear machine. It lists multiple examples of CNN trying to terrify the public, and if this election and the polls are any indication, they’ve done their job.",1
"According to Barack Obama, what is essential for nations to combat extremism is not a strong determination to crush these enemies through high-tech military campaigns. It is not a steadfast commitment to take the battle to radical ideologies. No, according to Barack Obama, the solution lies in embracing a global governance structure and a readiness to ""curb individual liberties.""  

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, Obama urged world leaders that our only path forward is to trust international institutions like the UN and to sacrifice some of our autonomy — what he referred to as our ""freedom of action."" Obama also emphasized that ""great powers"" such as the U.S. must accept limitations in order to align with the decisions of the global community — a position he admits has drawn criticism back home. “We need to back up our words with actions. The only way we can fulfill the original mission of this organization — to replace conflict with collaboration — is if major nations like ours agree to be bound by rules. I know I’m often attacked in my own country for supporting international agreements and multilateralism, but I believe that limiting our freedom of action, not abandoning our security or interests, will ultimately make us safer.”  

The UN was once seen as a noble effort, but it has long been shown to be ineffective. Its real function seems to be redistributing influence and resources among countries. In this system, the U.S. and similar nations do most of the work while receiving little in return — just criticism, resentment, and a push for collectivist control. Since America elected a leader who puts other nations’ concerns above those of the country he's sworn to protect, we've struggled on the world stage. It’s no surprise that this president continues to promote a one-world order and restrictions on personal freedoms. Do you remember when American leaders stood firm in their belief in the American model, insisting that other nations should aspire to our values rather than the other way around?",1
"In another shocking example of Donald Trump's self-serving mindset, the Republican presidential candidate quickly jumped to defend his hasty remarks about the New York City bombings just hours after the incident, without waiting for any official confirmation. Faced with intense criticism from journalists, Trump doubled down on his reckless statements rather than acknowledging his premature judgment. “The Donald” insisted that not only was he correct in labeling the event a “bomb,” but he also believed the media should have given him credit for “anticipating it” before the facts were fully known. In reality, the press was working diligently to verify the situation and avoid spreading misinformation. During an appearance on Fox News, Trump stated, “What I said was exactly right. I should be a reporter because I called it before the news did. But what I said was exactly right, and everyone says, ‘While he was right, he said it too fast.’” Trump’s focus remains disturbingly self-centered, with no regard for the 29 people hurt or the need for responsible reporting. As of this morning, a suspect has been taken into custody. How would we expect Donald Trump to act if he became Commander-in-Chief?

"A number of people were stunned when GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump casually invited Gennifer Flowers, the woman who had a scandalous affair with former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, to sit in the front row at the next presidential debate. If someone as clueless as Mark Cuban, known for his failed business ventures, wants to be there, why not have Gennifer Flowers right next to him? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016. This tweet was just another sign of Trump’s tendency to lash out when he feels disrespected. It seems the Trump campaign quickly realized how inappropriate this move was, and they’ve been working hard to clarify that Flowers will not be attending the event. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager and close advisor, addressed the controversy by stating: “We don’t expect her to be a guest of the campaign.” She then tried to justify it by claiming Trump was simply sending a message to Hillary Clinton: “Mr. Trump was letting them know we could bring guests that would bother Hillary.” The issue is completely unnecessary. Hillary made the personal choice to remain with her husband after his infidelity, just as many women do. This is old news and has no place in the 2016 election. Bringing it up is sexist, disrespectful, and completely irrelevant. Trump's attempt to use this incident is nothing more than a sexist attack on a woman for choosing to forgive her partner. It’s not fair to bring up private matters in a political race, and it’s certainly not the public’s concern. This is yet another example of Trump’s inability to handle the responsibilities of the presidency.

"Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden’s team reportedly asked for the most strategic tool to help him appear more commanding against Republican opponent Donald Trump during the debate on Tuesday — a platform that would allow him to stand at eye level with Trump, who is 6’3″. At just 5’11”, Biden was allegedly concerned about appearing physically diminished next to the former president, but the debate commission denied the request. Instead, as reported by The New York Post, they will be using a specially designed riser to even out their heights. But that’s not all! Biden’s team also reportedly inquired if there would be any scheduled breaks during the two-hour event. The answer? No breaks at all. Moderator Chris Wallace has no power to pause the debate — not even if Biden experiences another coughing episode or needs a moment to catch his breath. It was also confirmed that audio levels for both candidates will remain unchanged, ensuring full transparency — no enhancements, no edits. Can Biden withstand the pressure of facing Trump directly, without any physical setbacks? The debate was expected to attract over 95 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched political events of the year. If he struggles, it could damage his campaign significantly. Just last week, Biden had a brief but noticeable moment of difficulty during a town hall in Pennsylvania. If something similar occurs, or worse — if he loses balance — it could be a major blow. The upcoming debate is shaping up to be a real spectacle. Share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

"One doesn't need to wear the flag on their sleeve to call this country home. But when I hear attacks on American values disguised as ""progressive"" thinking, I can't help but ask: If you despise what this nation represents, why do you stay? That's the question that should be directed at those who pressured a university to alter a celebration of American culture.  

Students at Western Oregon University were planning a themed picnic to honor American heritage, featuring traditional foods and patriotic decorations. However, as they prepared, they were told by campus staff that the event needed to be rebranded because the ""American theme"" was deemed ""too controversial."" The person responsible for the directive, Hall Director Megan Thompson, stated that the inclusion of the Stars and Stripes on banners was considered ""too nationalistic"" and potentially ""offensive to some students."" She added that the administration had raised concerns about the event's tone, though she couldn't specify exactly who had made the decision. ""I was just given instructions,"" she said. ""They said we needed to tone it down.""  

The event was modified to include a more neutral theme, and roughly 200 students attended. University officials refused to comment in detail, calling the situation a ""misunderstanding."" Still, the student organizers are pushing for clarity on why such a simple event was questioned in the first place. What’s most concerning isn’t just the growing skepticism toward patriotism in higher education, but the way bureaucratic rules are enforced without accountability—leaving students to wonder if the real issue is not the event itself, but the fear of standing for something. After all, “We’re just following protocol” has become the excuse of choice for those in power.",1
"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has finally acknowledged to reporters that she would change her approach to migration policy if given the chance. In a recent press briefing, she expressed openness to reevaluating Germany's stance on refugee admissions, stating, ""If I knew what the German people truly want in terms of migration policy, I would be ready to reconsider."" These remarks followed the Christian Democratic Union’s poor performance in the recent Berlin municipal elections. Merkel admitted she felt the loss deeply and accepted full responsibility as both party leader and national leader. The election results are seen as a reflection of growing public frustration with immigration, fueled in part by the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). While Merkel has shown willingness to reflect on past decisions, she has not indicated any real shift in policy. She emphasized that while she regrets some of her earlier positions, she will not adopt the more restrictive views of her own party members. For instance, the Christian Social Union has pushed for a strict cap of 200,000 migrants per year and prioritization of Christian refugees over Muslim ones. However, Merkel firmly rejected these ideas, saying, ""If people oppose Muslim asylum-seekers solely based on their religion, that goes against our values and principles."" The CSU leader, Horst Seehofer, had previously threatened to withdraw support from Merkel unless she supported the migrant cap. He warned, ""It's time we find common ground to stay relevant in the next election."" The current anti-migrant sentiment is partly driven by fears linked to terrorism, rising crime rates, and public concerns about the impact of large-scale migration. While Merkel remains defiant, some analysts suggest this could signal a potential loss in the upcoming federal election or at best a narrow victory. Critics argue that her policies mirror those of progressive leaders like Obama and Clinton, which has made her unpopular among certain groups, including many Americans.",1
"Jim Carrey could be hanging up his acting shoes for good, and the story is wild. Jim Carrey, a global icon in the entertainment industry, is best recognized for his roles in hilarious movies like “The Mask” and “Liar Liar.” However, the comedian is now facing a devastating personal crisis that may mark the end of his public life. Last September, Jim Carrey was shocked to learn that his 27-year-old girlfriend, Emily Rose, had taken her own life. According to reports, she left behind a note for Jim before overdosing. Upon hearing the news, he released a heartfelt statement expressing his deep sorrow. “I’m completely heartbroken by the loss of my beautiful Emily. She was a gentle soul, too fragile for this world, and her love was pure. My thoughts are with her family and everyone who cared about her. This has been like a thunderclap.”  

When investigators arrived at the scene, they discovered three different medications on Emily’s nightstand: Xanax (anxiety medication), Oxycodone (painkiller), and Lorazepam (anti-anxiety drug). All were prescribed under the name Arthur King, which was reportedly Jim Carrey’s fake identity. It was revealed that Emily had previously attempted suicide in 2015 after a breakup. Now, Jim is being accused of providing the pills that led to her death. The legal claim suggests that he gave her the drugs just a few days before her passing and even sent her messages asking if she had taken them from his home. In addition, it was said that Emily had been using painkillers for weeks prior to her death.  

Of course, Jim was aware of her mental health struggles, so it's hard to believe he would knowingly give her the pills. The couple had recently ended their relationship, and in her note, she wrote, “I can’t live without you. I tried to be strong, but I just don’t have the strength anymore. I’m sorry I wasn’t enough for you. I gave you everything I had. Whatever you decide about the future is okay with me… Please forgive me. I’m just not meant for this world.” This is absolutely crazy!",1
"With yet another series of attacks—including two bombings and a stabbing—occurring within a 12-hour period, the nation has been reminded that we are facing threats from both domestic extremism and the radicalized following of a brutal ideology. As expected, the two presidential candidates addressed the incidents. However, only one response truly grabbed the public's attention—not for its content, but for the way it was delivered. During a press briefing following a bombing in Chicago, Hillary Clinton once again criticized Donald Trump, but many observers questioned whether she was speaking under the influence of something unusual. Her voice was unusually calm, almost lethargic, and she appeared disoriented, as if struggling to stay awake. Speaking to reporters covering her campaign, she said, “I’ve been informed about the attacks in Chicago and Philadelphia. We must do everything possible to support our first responders, and I’ll have more to say once we have more information.” When asked about Trump’s comments, she responded, “It’s important to stick to the facts in situations like this. That’s why we need to support the people investigating what happened. It’s better to wait for the truth before making judgments, especially when we’re still in the early stages.” Social media exploded with speculation, with many claiming Clinton seemed either sedated or completely drained. Some even questioned her ability to lead. Is she on heavy medication?

"In 2008, President Barack Obama faced a tough general election against a charismatic but polarizing Republican candidate, John McCain. For all of his flaws, McCain was seen as more principled and less entangled in scandal than the current Democratic contender. Obama managed to secure his victory largely due to his strong appeal to younger voters and his message of hope and change. In fact, the 2008 campaign brought the term ""young voters"" into the national spotlight, as a new generation of politically active citizens began to shape the nation's future. These young voters, once overlooked, now saw themselves as key players in the political process. Fast forward 12 years to the 2020 presidential election, and this same group of young voters is once again becoming a decisive force in American politics. The 2020 version of these progressive voters seems poised to support Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and recent events have only reinforced their stance. On Friday evening, a suspicious device was found near a protest rally in Portland, Oregon. Authorities evacuated the area and later discovered two more unexploded items nearby. Later that night, another explosive device detonated in Minneapolis, injuring several people and causing widespread panic. Within hours, law enforcement swept the surrounding neighborhoods and uncovered additional devices. By Saturday morning, liberal commentators and media outlets were quick to criticize President Trump’s remarks about the explosions, labeling them as “alarmist” and “unfounded.” They accused him of jumping to conclusions without evidence, while simultaneously downplaying any potential connection to extremist ideologies. Then, on Sunday, authorities arrested three individuals linked to the incidents, and by Monday, they had identified the suspect — a known activist with ties to radical groups. The suspect, it turned out, had a history of anti-government sentiment and had been monitored by federal agencies. By the time the country awoke, many liberals were beginning to question their initial reluctance to label the events as terrorism. Consider the statements made by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday: “We don’t have enough information to call this an act of terrorism,” he said, emphasizing the need for caution before making such claims. “We know it was intentional, violent, and criminal, but we can’t assume motives or connections to any specific group.” The liberal hesitation to use the word “terrorism” continues to baffle many. It’s as if Frey believes that naming the act as terrorism automatically implies a specific religious affiliation. Yet, according",1
"As if Donald Trump’s proposal to restrict Muslim immigration wasn’t enough to anger liberals, his broader vision to counter the “Islamization” of America includes a controversial stance on Sharia law. Trump has suggested that Muslims who support Sharia could face deportation. In a surprising twist, some individuals attempted to defend Sharia in response. On social media, liberal commentator and activist Sarah Stewart tweeted, “Donald Trump, many American Muslims—those fighting extremism—are actually aligned with Sharia principles.” What’s more, Stewart is a woman who would be at risk under Sharia law, as it mandates severe punishments for homosexuality. While there is no scholarly debate over the punishment itself, there is disagreement on the method. If this is considered “progressive,” it raises serious questions about what we’re supporting. Most Americans would likely reject stoning for adultery or amputation for theft. Now, according to a recent report by John Martinez, it's becoming clear which legal system many American Muslims favor. Fox News visited the Cedar Riverside neighborhood to speak with Somali residents about their views on living in America and American law. In the video, every single person interviewed stated they prefer Sharia law over American law. “If you're Muslim, you naturally want Sharia,” they said. They believe it's acceptable to kill someone who insults the Prophet Muhammad. They also think it's normal to force a girl into marriage at age 15. When asked if they’d rather live in America or Somalia, they chose Somalia. The most shocking moment came when a young man admitted, “I’m not Americanized—I can speak English well, but my culture and values are still Somali.” Watch the full interview at video.foxnews.com In a previous segment from May, Fox also reported that at least two Islamic schools in the area teach Sharia law. This aligns with a 2022 poll by the Center for Security Policy, which found that over half (53%) of U.S. Muslims believe they should have the option of Sharia courts or their own tribunals. Only 37% supported full American judicial oversight. America is a land of freedom—but that doesn’t mean we should accept the harshness of Sharia law.",1

"A man in a security uniform entered a shopping center in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday evening. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" before stabbing eight people. According to reports, the attacker asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before attacking them. The suspect has been identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and practicing Muslim. Members of the local Somali-American community confirmed his identity, as reported by the St. Cloud Times. On Sunday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that Adan was one of their operatives. This incident occurred just days after a bomb exploded at a Marine Corps event in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacked NYPD officers with a knife in New York, and a device detonated in Chelsea, Manhattan, injuring 29 people.  

Local Somali leaders issued a statement expressing support for Adan’s family, calling him a “good student” and “upstanding member” of the community. St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis told the media that Adan was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer named Jason Falconer, who intervened during the attack. Kleis praised Falconer as a hero who ""happened to be in the right place at the right time."" Falconer confronted Adan and identified himself as a law enforcement officer, prompting Adan to attack him. Falconer then fatally wounded Adan, sending him to ""meet his 72 virgins—though they might end up being pigs.""  

Last year, the Washington Times revealed that the Obama administration had resettled nearly 10,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota. Officials warned that groups like ISIS and al-Shabab are actively recruiting from this population. In fact, al-Shabab released a video threatening attacks on malls worldwide, including the Mall of America. They also claimed responsibility for the 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Kenya, which killed 67 people.  

In July, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota have been accused of making threats against local women. In May, Voice of America News noted that ISIS has grown stronger in Somalia, receiving support from Yemeni affiliates. In June, three Somalians in Minnesota were convicted of attempting to join ISIS. In July, al-Shabab reportedly sought to align with ISIS for future attacks on U.S. soil.

"In another shocking example of Donald Trump's self-centered approach, the Republican presidential candidate quickly jumped to defend his premature remarks about the New York City bombings just hours after the incident, long before any official confirmation was available. Confronted with widespread criticism from journalists for his reckless statements, Trump doubled down on his claims rather than acknowledging his mistake. “The Donald” insisted that not only was he correct in labeling the event a “bomb,” but he also believed the media should have praised him for “predicting it” before the facts were confirmed. In reality, the press was working diligently to report accurately and responsibly, not recklessly amplifying unverified claims. On Fox News, Trump stated, “What I said was exactly right. I should be a reporter because I called it before the news did. But what I said was exactly right, and everyone says, ‘While he was right, he said it too soon.’” Trump’s focus remains unmistakable—every tragedy becomes an opportunity for self-promotion.

"One of former President Bill Clinton’s longtime confidants has recently spoken out, claiming that something is seriously wrong with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and if true, it could significantly harm her campaign. Linda Harper, a retired political analyst and author of *The Hidden Side of Hillary*, alleges that Clinton has been “walking on a tightrope,” due to her intense emotional volatility and unrelenting ambition. “People with that kind of intensity don’t last long,” Harper told *The Daily Pulse*. “Hillary Clinton isn’t mentally prepared for the presidency. If she was in a wheelchair or had a severe illness, she might still manage, but her mind is deteriorating.” Harper, who has worked closely with several high-profile politicians, claims Clinton is showing signs of mental decline, including memory lapses, poor judgment, and an inability to focus. These issues, combined with her tendency toward distrust and control, could lead to a major crisis in leadership. “Her paranoia and need to dominate are not new,” Harper said. “They’ve always been there, but now they’re becoming more dangerous.” Harper wrote her book to reveal what she sees as the truth about Clinton — a woman obsessed with power and willing to sacrifice her well-being for political gain. “She’s been chasing power since the 1970s, when she first started aligning herself with Bill,” she added. This latest accusation adds to the growing scrutiny surrounding Clinton, who has faced ongoing criticism over her health, temperament, and leadership abilities.

"Paul Combetta, the IT specialist linked to Hillary Clinton's email server cleanup, reportedly turned to online communities for guidance on how to erase digital traces of sensitive information. Last week, Combetta invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during testimony before the House Oversight Committee, but he was more forthcoming when seeking advice from fellow tech professionals on Reddit about removing Clinton’s email address from archived messages. A user on the platform reportedly advised him that the only way to do so was to delete the emails entirely. The evidence first surfaced on 8chan and included old Reddit posts from two years ago. One thread was titled “Here is clear proof that Hillary tried to destroy evidence,” and it featured a post from someone claiming to be the IT expert who helped wipe Clinton’s server. The user also asked how to replace real email addresses with fake ones. This occurred around the same time Congress was demanding access to Clinton’s emails. He claimed the client was a high-profile individual known to everyone. A Reddit post attributed to Paul Combetta (the IT guy who received FBI immunity and deleted Clinton’s emails) has been uncovered, showing he used the same username on his Etsy page: https://www.etsy.com/people/stonetear (Backup: http://archive.is/P45cY).

"This is a true story. General Stanley McChrystal served as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan and often clashed with his superiors over military strategy. At one tense meeting, he was summoned to the Oval Office, sensing that his career might be ending. When President Barack Obama called him in, McChrystal knew things were not going well. The President accused him of failing to back him politically. ""It's not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President,"" McChrystal said, ""it's my duty to support you as Commander-in-Chief."" With that, he handed over his resignation.  

Obama, known for his sharp tongue, wasn’t ready to let the matter rest. He fired off a final jab: ""I bet when I’m gone, you’ll be glad to pee on my grave."" McChrystal responded with a salute. ""Mr. President, I always vowed I’d never stand in line again after leaving the Army. You did a good job, General. After a few years in the ground, the line will have shrunk enough that you won’t have to wait. You’re an honorable man — I know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.""",1
"The Senate on Monday failed to approve a short-term funding measure to keep the government operating as Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, refused to allow transparency in corporate political donations and blocked aid for the struggling residents of Flint, Michigan. Lawmakers had been negotiating a continuing resolution that would fund federal agencies until at least December 9. Without such an agreement, the government would face a shutdown within three days on October 1. The Republican opposition to the bill was fueled by a provision that McConnell insisted be included, which would prevent the SEC from mandating that public companies reveal their political expenditures. This rule has allowed corporations to funnel unlimited money into elections without public disclosure, a practice that has grown significantly since the Citizens United ruling in 2010. This has resulted in over $700 million in corporate political spending this year, largely benefiting conservative causes and wealthy donors. In exchange for maintaining this secrecy, Senate Republicans have chosen to risk a government shutdown, prioritizing the interests of their financial backers over the needs of everyday citizens. 

Another point of contention has been the refusal of Senate Republicans to include aid for Flint, Michigan, which is still dealing with the aftermath of a water crisis caused by policy decisions made under previous administrations. While the bill already contains disaster relief for flood victims in Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, Democrats have pushed for similar support for Flint’s residents. Republicans, however, have dismissed these requests, claiming the issue is local or suggesting it should be handled through the separate Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). But this argument falls apart, as a version of the WRDA passed earlier this year included over $220 million in aid for Flint, only to be stripped out by House Republicans led by Paul Ryan. With the House controlled by hardline conservatives, it’s unlikely that Flint’s needs will be addressed before the November election. Once again, Republicans are putting party loyalty and corporate interests above the well-being of vulnerable communities, leading the country closer to a government shutdown with no real justification. These actions highlight how many Republicans have shifted their focus from serving the public to protecting the interests of their wealthiest donors. If the suffering of minorities must be ignored to maintain this status quo, they seem willing to do so without hesitation.",1
"Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile appeared on CNN’s “The Situation Room” on Saturday and spoke about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s unsteady appearance on Sept. 11. What was meant to be a supportive remark turned into an unexpected revelation regarding the seriousness of Clinton’s condition that day. “She had to be helped into the vehicle, but she still stood tall and kept moving forward, which is exactly the kind of strength I’ve always admired in her,” Brazile said, as reported by Fox News. This is the first time a senior Clinton campaign official has openly acknowledged that the former secretary of state required assistance to get into the van, a detail that has sparked significant concern among critics. The admission raises serious questions about Clinton’s physical stability, especially given the public nature of the incident. Brazile likely intended to praise Clinton, but instead, she inadvertently highlighted a troubling moment that could damage the candidate’s credibility. Many are now wondering how long Clinton has been struggling with her health and what kind of support she requires to carry out her duties. While Clinton has admitted to suffering from pneumonia, this does not excuse her history of withholding important health information from the public. She claimed she didn’t consider it significant, but with so much attention on her well-being, it’s hard to see how she could have ignored the growing scrutiny. Her condition on Sept. 11 was visibly severe, and global observers may have taken note — potentially seeing it as a sign of vulnerability.

This concern has been fueled by a video that surfaced on social media over the weekend, captured by CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who was present as Clinton left a community center in Washington, D.C. According to the website Right Wing Watch, Clinton was exiting the Children’s Defense Fund office when Acosta attempted to engage her in conversation.  

The footage shows Clinton walking down a short flight of steps, carefully gripping the railing and taking each step with deliberate caution. At first, she appeared to ignore Acosta’s questions, focusing instead on maintaining her balance. Only after reaching the bottom did she briefly acknowledge the reporter, offering a brief smile before responding with “I’m ready” when asked about her preparation for the upcoming presidential debate. She then slowly climbed into her campaign vehicle without assistance, though a Secret Service agent remained nearby, presumably on standby.  

While it’s possible Clinton simply didn’t hear or notice the reporter until she reached the bottom, the video has already sparked renewed discussion about her physical condition. Some are interpreting her behavior as evidence of ongoing health challenges that could affect her ability to move confidently in public. Others suggest it highlights a pattern of selective engagement with the press, where she chooses which questions to address and which to ignore.  

Share this post on Facebook and Twitter so others can see Hillary Clinton's cautious descent down a small set of stairs, seemingly more focused on her footing than on answering questions from reporters. What do you think about the way Hillary Clinton was seen navigating a short staircase? Let us know in the comments below!",1
"When you WATCH this VIDEO, you’ll need a box of tissues. The more I watched, the more I was moved to tears. It starts with a man addressing supporters of Black Lives Matter, saying, “This is for the people who scream ‘Black Lives Matter’ but never stand up against the violence happening in our own communities every single day. Until you start protesting black-on-black crime, shut the f***k up and stop making noise.” To back up his point, here are some shocking statistics from the Uniform Crime Report’s Supplemental Homicide Reports, which reveal a disturbing pattern: ⦁ Although only 6% of the U.S. population is Black and male, they account for 58.3% of individuals killed by private citizens in self-defense. ⦁ 74.2% of Black males killed in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by other Black individuals. ⦁ 43.1% of all homicide victims from 2009-2012 were Black males. ⦁ 89.1% of Black males murdered in criminal homicides during that time were killed by another Black person. ⦁ 41.3% of police officers killed in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were murdered by Black males. In 2012, white males made up 38% of the population and committed 4,582 murders. Meanwhile, Black males, who were just 6.6% of the population, committed 5,531 murders. That means Black people—despite being only a fifth of the population—committed nearly 1,000 more murders than white people. These numbers expose a harsh reality often overlooked by racialists and liberal advocates: young Black men are far more likely to come into contact with (mostly white) police officers, sometimes five to ten times more frequently than white individuals. This dynamic creates a dangerous situation. So, here's the truth: Black Americans make up about 13% of the population but have been responsible for roughly half of all homicides in the U.S. for nearly three decades. According to DOJ data, Black people committed 52% of homicides between 1980 and 2008. In 2013, they accounted for 38% of murders, while",1
"Now we learn that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s also a self-pitying complainer. Ahmad filed a lawsuit claiming that police in Elizabeth, New Jersey were targeting his family because of their background. Ironically, he was later arrested for placing bombs across the Tri-state area—something he once fought against.  

In the lawsuit, the family alleged that local authorities were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant, which they had operated since 2002. They said they received numerous unjustified tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad all joined the lawsuit, stating that residents also verbally harassed them, saying things like “Muslims don’t belong here.”  

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Newark, states that the family is from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the restaurant since 2002. From April 2009 to 2011, they claim they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10 p.m., even though they had permission to do so. The legal documents allege that the police showed a “reckless disregard and deliberate indifference” toward their constitutional rights.  

According to the suit, the Elizabeth police allegedly took steps to harass, humiliate, and retaliate against them in an effort to force the business to close at 10 p.m. Officers reportedly told them the area around the restaurant was “too dangerous” and “known for crime.”  

The irony is that just five years later, Ahmad was arrested for doing exactly what he had previously complained about. It's hard to believe someone goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in such a short time. I wonder if anyone really thinks Ahmad turned radical because he felt discriminated against, or if it’s more likely he was an extremist all along, using his grievances as a cover.",1
"Pennsylvania Republicans are pushing a bill through the legislature that would take immediate effect, allowing outsiders to monitor polling places and challenge voters on Election Day in an effort to support Donald Trump. First introduced in June, House Bill 29 would permit non-residents to observe elections in any district and give them the authority to question voters, potentially causing confusion, long lines, and voter suppression. This, critics argue, would effectively legalize voter intimidation. Adam Gitlin, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, warned earlier this month that poll watchers—particularly those with biased motives—could interfere with the voting process by targeting individuals based on race or faith. ""There's a real risk that people will show up without knowing the rules and face discriminatory challenges,"" Gitlin said. ""This could lead to longer wait times, voter discouragement, and a breakdown in the democratic process."" Conservatives aligned with Trump, who are often accused of promoting a narrow vision of Christianity, are expected to target Black, Latino, and Muslim voters, as they have in the past. And that’s exactly what Trump wants. ""We’re going to watch Pennsylvania closely,"" Trump said during a recent rally. ""Go into certain areas, watch and learn, and make sure no one votes multiple times. If we do that, we won’t lose. The only way we can lose is if there’s cheating."" His campaign even has a page on his website encouraging supporters to sign up as poll watchers to ""Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!"" In response to Trump’s claims of election fraud, Pennsylvania Republicans added an amendment to the bill to make it effective immediately upon passage, rather than after a 60-day delay. With the race tightening ahead of the first debate, Pennsylvania has become even more critical. But if this law passes, it could shift the balance in Trump’s favor and set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country. In essence, Trump and his allies are trying to rig the election by making voter interference legal—and if it works here, they’ll push for it everywhere else.",1
"As we witness police officers being targeted and killed, and see protests flare up every time a Black person is shot by law enforcement, it might be worth looking at the real data behind these incidents. The number of people killed by police using deadly force is extremely low. After all, it's meant to be a last resort. In fact, more white individuals are killed during encounters with police, yet this rarely makes the headlines. Check the numbers below. If Black lives truly mattered to activists, they'd focus on reducing crime and supporting their communities instead of inciting violence. Groups like Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers, and the Nation of Islam often engage in riots, looting, and even violence—sometimes in their own neighborhoods. It’s chaos they seek, not justice.  

From Freedom Daily: In 2013, the U.S. population was 316,128,839. Here are annual percentages:

"In every state, there are established laws governing how elections are conducted. The Democratic Party, described as a ""dangerous radical organization,"" has been actively working to undermine the electoral process through any method possible. [Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America's Most Dangerous Radical Group] As a patriot and constitutionalist who has studied political systems and understands the Democrats' plans, this author believes the party is determined to impose a socialist regime in the U.S., using voter fraud, ballot tampering, and other illegal tactics to get ""Hillary the Horrible"" elected as President in the November 2016 election. A fair election requires encouraging all eligible citizens to vote. However, it is unacceptable—especially from the Democratic Party, which is openly trying to manipulate the November presidential race—to support voting methods that enable fraud. A proper election must be free, fair, and honest. Only those who are properly registered and legally eligible should be allowed to cast their votes. This means implementing a straightforward, easily accessible photo ID that is hard to counterfeit, requiring voters to prove they are citizens, legal residents, and qualified to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this because they want people who may not be eligible, registered, or even truthful about their identity to vote, allowing them to steal the election and install the corrupt and dangerous Hillary the Horrible as the next and final leader of a crumbling United States. Due to the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our corrupt Congress, and our biased federal courts, there have been no meaningful efforts to pass laws ensuring fair and honest elections. As a result, the only option left for the American people in the November election is to mobilize in large numbers to monitor polling places and prevent voter fraud as much as possible. Donald Trump, despite his imperfections, has clearly stated his positions, including a strong and patriotic speech delivered at a rally on Friday, September 23, where he expressed his love for this country and his mission to protect it from tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most dangerous “radical group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” elected to turn America into a dictatorship and a nightmare, but they will steal the election if given the chance. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is our last opportunity to stop or delay the collapse of our 240-year-old republic. Given the extreme corruption and hostility toward everything good that the Democratic Party represents, every citizen in every voting district who",1
"The House Oversight Committee has directed the social media platform Reddit to retain copies of messages allegedly posted by a computer specialist linked to the effort to remove Hillary Clinton’s email address from her correspondence. (If you're not familiar with this story, you can read more here) Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, head of the Oversight Committee, stated to The Hill that the request ""has legal weight, and you can't destroy evidence hoping it disappears."" The messages in question were reportedly shared by Paul Combetta, a technician at Platte River Networks, a Denver-based IT company that worked with Clinton in 2013 to manage her private email server. These posts were deleted on Monday, shortly after they were discovered and shared online. In the posts, a user under the name “stonetear” sought guidance on how to “remove” email addresses from a “high-profile individual's” account. “They don’t want the VIP’s email exposed and want to be able to strip or replace the email address in the to/from fields of outgoing emails,” the post reads, dated July 24, 2014 — a key date in the Clinton email controversy. The day before, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had agreed to obtain Clinton’s work-related emails from the State Department. The FBI’s report on its investigation of Clinton’s emails noted that Combetta had transferred backup copies of her emails to two of her attorneys, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, during that same month. The Reddit post raises concerns about potential efforts to conceal information. If “stonetear” is indeed Combetta, this would not be the first instance of suspected tampering. Combetta was the technician who used BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton’s emails in late March 2015, following public revelations about her email setup and after Congress had issued subpoenas for her records. He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his use of the software. Despite this, the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation. Recently, Combetta and another Platte River Networks employee, Bill Thornton, refused to appear at a House Oversight Committee hearing, invoking their Fifth Amendment rights. Chaffetz told The Hill that the allegations against Combetta “fit the pattern of what we believe was happening.” North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows acknowledged the strong circumstantial evidence pointing to Combetta as “stonetear,” but emphasized the need for definitive proof. “We want",1
"Bernard Sansaricq, former head of the Haitian Senate, released a strong critique against the Clinton Foundation, which was shared on Donald Trump’s campaign site. In his statement, Sansaricq claimed that when Haiti was hit by the 2010 earthquake, corruption spread quicker than the aid that was desperately needed. He argued that despite billions of dollars funneled into the Clinton Foundation, the people of Haiti are still struggling. According to Sansaricq, the Clintons took advantage of the crisis to siphon millions from the impoverished and starving population. The global community placed its trust in the Clintons during one of Haiti’s darkest hours, only to be misled. The Clintons and their allies have grown wealthier while countless Haitians remain in temporary shelters. The public has a right to know where the funds went and why real help never arrived. This issue is explored in depth in Peter Schweizer’s book *Clinton Cash*, which outlines how foreign governments and businesses contributed to the Clintons' wealth. At a recent Trump event, Sansaricq alleged that Bill Clinton attempted to bribe him, claiming his visa was canceled after he refused. A group of Haitian activists staged a protest against the Clinton Foundation’s involvement in Haiti during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.",1

""Political Pulse"" is a fresh podcast from Fox News featuring two right-leaning analysts who engage with key figures to discuss the evolving landscape of American conservatism and the Republican Party. (Fox News) According to Dave Wasserman, a senior political analyst at The Cook Political Report, voters who remain undecided this election cycle are more informed than ever about the major party candidates — and they’re still dissatisfied. ""In previous elections, undecided voters often weren’t paying much attention,"" Wasserman told Fox News' ""Political Pulse"" hosts, Mike Cernovich and Laura Ingraham, in a recent interview. Wasserman, who previously worked with former Democratic Rep. Bob Livingston, compared the current undecided voter to someone standing at the edge of a pool, hesitant to jump in. ""These voters are fully aware of their options, but they're reluctant to commit — not because they don’t know the choices, but because they don’t want to pick either side,"" he explained. He also mentioned that for the first time in his career, he’s finding it hard to rely on the data coming from the campaigns, as undecided voters feel trapped between two unappealing choices. ""This is the most difficult choice I've seen in years,"" Wasserman said. ""One person told me, 'I don't trust Biden on economic policy, but Trump would destroy our alliances.' That’s why people are saying, 'I’d rather stay home than vote for either one.'"" Wasserman added that the growing divide between different groups — especially between college-educated voters and non-college voters — isn’t solely due to one candidate. ""It's been a long-term trend,"" he said. ""You can’t blame everything on a single campaign or rally.""

"Former President George H.W. Bush revealed to a small group of attendees at a charity event in Kennebunkport, Maine, that he plans to vote for Hillary Clinton, according to a report from CBS News. The statement was made during a reception hosted by the Points of Light Foundation on Monday, where Bush, 92, spoke privately with around 30 guests. 

The revelation came after Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, shared a photo on Instagram of herself with Bush, captioning it, ""The President told me he’s supporting Hillary!"" She later confirmed to The Washington Post that she met with Bush during his stay in Maine, where he expressed his choice for this year's election.

Townsend, who serves on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation, said Bush made his comments in confidence. A spokesperson for the former president told CBS, ""President Bush will cast his ballot as a private citizen in about 50 days, and he has no further comments on the presidential race at this time.""",1
"Okay, I have to say, I watched the debate last night expecting to see Hillary have a breakdown or maybe even collapse on stage. But nothing like that happened. In fact, she looked completely composed—her makeup was perfect, her hair was styled just right, and even those wrinkles my mom kept pointing out were nowhere to be seen. I was confused because she’s had so many strange episodes lately: coughing fits, stumbling, barely able to climb stairs without help. How did she manage to stand through the whole debate without any issues? The first half, her eyes looked tired, but then something must have kicked in around the middle. My friend Sarah said she was disappointed in Trump, but she also called Hillary a ""born liar"" and mentioned how she's always been manipulative. I’m not sure if she lied outright tonight, maybe about Trump supporting the Iraq War, but she definitely has a cold, calculating side. There are still two more debates, and I really hope Trump comes in sharper next time and can land some good punches. I was excited to watch Trump at first, but by the second half, Hillary seemed to really turn it up. She was aggressive, unapologetic, and clearly ready to fight. Even the liberal panel from PBS News Hour looked pretty down after her performance. Sure, she won, but they felt she didn’t bring anything meaningful to the table. They weren’t impressed with her energy or substance. They even seemed unenthusiastic about her dominating Trump, who looked like he was being dragged through the mud. Liberal CNN’s David Gergen even wrote that Clinton “crushed Trump, but was that enough?” I thought if she won decisively, she’d secure the election, but now I think it might still come down to the wire. Trump’s base doesn’t care about traditional metrics—they’ve had enough of politicians who promise a lot and deliver nothing. They saw Trump as a voice for their frustration. At the same time, Hillary struggled to connect emotionally with voters. Her team has been worried about her ability to relate to younger voters, especially compared to Obama. She may have argued well, but she lost because people don’t feel a real connection to her. Of course not—she’s a monster. Someone else was happy that Hillary showed up looking like a disaster, and they don’t get to vote for either candidate. My favorite part of the whole thing was all the coverage about what Putin thought of the debate",1
"CNN has reported through its polling that Hillary Clinton emerged as the clear winner of the first presidential debate. However, conflicting reports suggest a different narrative. Quick polls from various outlets indicate Donald Trump as the debate's victor. Topics discussed during the debate included the Birther claims, the email scandal, and Trump’s tax records, among other issues. Check out some of the quick polls below, including those from The New York Times, Breitbart, NBC News, ABC 7, and several other media sources.  

Donald Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude for the support he received in the polls and for people believing he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has remained silent on the matter. According to the CNN quick poll, Clinton received 62 percent of the votes while Trump got 27 percent, a significant gap considering most polls suggested otherwise. This discrepancy raises questions about the integrity of the CNN poll or the demographic makeup of the respondents.  

CNN admitted that the sample leaned more Democratic, which could explain the outcome. Additionally, the poll showed mixed reactions regarding whether the debate would influence voters’ decisions. Therefore, even if Clinton led in this poll, it doesn’t necessarily mean she will gain more support at the ballot box.  

Despite these so-called ""winning"" numbers, Donald Trump has criticized the media for giving him a faulty microphone and claimed he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. He even threatened to skip future debates, which seems odd given his apparent victory. With the election just a month away, time is running out for both candidates to sway public opinion.  

Don’t forget that Julian Assange previously hinted at an October surprise from WikiLeaks that could harm Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We’ll have to wait and see what unfolds.",1
"Most Americans are unaware that not all changes in government come through open conflict. For example, Hitler rose to power through the democratic process in Germany, and similarly, Hugo Chávez was elected in Venezuela. Today, a similar transformation is taking place in the United States under the influence of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party—yet many remain unaware of the shift. It’s unclear if this change is being driven by a secretive group akin to SPECTRE or simply the result of decades of ideological infiltration. Either way, it's effectively a quiet coup. The progressive movement has been advancing through elections rather than violence, and they're succeeding. To do so, they had to erode traditional American values, which once stood in their way. If the Democratic Party had run on its current platform 60 years ago, it likely wouldn’t have won a single state. So how did they gain so much ground? In the 1960s, progressives—then known as liberals—began taking control of liberal arts departments in colleges and universities. These students, once focused on humanities, later entered journalism, education, and entertainment, where they helped shape public opinion. Many of them eventually joined the Democratic Party. Since Kennedy, every Democratic presidential candidate has supported progressive ideals. Even figures like LBJ and Bill Clinton, who were more opportunists than true believers, still advanced progressive agendas. Today, even moderate Democrats are rare. In fact, nearly half the party supported a self-proclaimed socialist as a nominee. Combined with media that favors Democrats and an education system that promotes progressive ideas, you get a political machine that keeps gaining power. Does anyone really think getting a photo ID is that hard? Democrats support any method—legal, questionable, or even illegal—to expand their voter base. Immigrants and refugees are welcomed, given benefits, and quickly turned into reliable voters. We remember the ACORN scandal, but if someone thinks that was a one-time mistake, they’re mistaken. The progressive revolution continues. There are over 300 sanctuary cities in the U.S., where local governments ignore federal law with little consequence. Some states also refuse to follow federal regulations when they conflict with their own views. Worse, our current president and key officials have ignored their constitutional oaths. And because of weak Republican leadership, these actions go unchecked. When Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress without real repercussions, that was a sign of a deeper issue. When the IRS targeted political opponents and destroyed",1
"An Englishman named James Carter has been taken into custody and is now facing trial after placing anti-halal stickers on meat at a supermarket in his hometown of Bolton. Halal refers to the ritual method of slaughtering animals according to Islamic law. Carter strongly opposes halal practices, arguing that they are connected not only to animal suffering but also to extremist financing. The stickers stated, “Warning: Halal is inhumane and supports extremism #EndHalal.” Recently, an investigation by an animal rights group revealed footage from a halal slaughterhouse in Lincolnshire where animals appeared to be handled roughly, with workers using dull knives and showing little care during the process. Additionally, a British anti-Islam activist named Daniel Moore claims that funds from halal meat sales often end up supporting radical groups. Moreover, businesses that sell halal-certified products are required to pay a religious levy. Despite these claims, the prosecutor in Carter’s case, Emma Fletcher, argued in court that “there are other ways to express concerns about animal treatment without linking it to religion and terrorism.” As a result, James now faces charges of “racially or religiously aggravated damage” and will go to trial on August 5 (H/T Daily Mail). It seems that in the UK, sharing uncomfortable truths about religious practices can lead to legal consequences. One might wonder if James would have more freedom in the U.S., where free speech protections allow people to voice their opinions without fear of prosecution.

"“Instead of addressing the dangerous policies that have allowed 78,000 criminal immigrants to return to the streets over the past three years, ICE attempted to cover up the issue by supplying misleading data to Congress and the public,” —Dan Stein, President of FAIR. In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the organization accused the Obama administration of “seriously underreporting” the number of crimes committed by undocumented criminals who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014. If the term ""undocumented criminals"" sounds extreme, it's because it is—these individuals are in the U.S. without legal status, making them illegal, and many have committed crimes while here. Some were arrested, incarcerated, but not deported.  

“In response to a request from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015, ICE stated that 30,558 criminal aliens released in FY 2014 had committed 1,423 additional offenses,” FAIR’s statement said. “However, documents obtained by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) on FAIR’s behalf revealed that the real number of convictions linked to these individuals was 13,288. It's important to note that not all charges lead to convictions, so the actual number of crimes may be even higher.”  

“The criminal aliens responsible for these convictions were not considered dangerous enough for deportation under ICE’s stated priorities,” the release continued. “The list of offenses includes murder, robbery, sexual assault, drunk driving, and more. Despite knowing the risks, ICE continued its approach in 2015, releasing nearly 20,000 more deportable individuals.”  

“Over the last few years, the number of criminal immigrants being deported has dropped sharply, even though there is enough funding to remove many more,” Stein said. “Because of policies that prioritize protecting undocumented individuals—criminals included—thousands of Americans have been needlessly harmed.”  

“Rather than stop these harmful, politically motivated policies that have put 78,000 deportable criminals back on the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to conceal the truth by giving false information to Congress and the public,” Stein added. “Additionally, despite knowing the full extent of the criminal activity, the Department of Homeland Security abandoned the Secure Communities program, which was meant to help ICE identify and detain criminal immigrants held by local",1
"In under 48 hours, during the past weekend, 20 individuals were shot in Chicago, with three losing their lives. This comes just days after Mayor Rahm Emanuel addressed the city's rising violence, calling for increased police presence and mentorship programs aimed at ""at-risk youth""—those who are often the ones committing the crimes. The real danger lies with the innocent people caught in the crossfire, not the criminals themselves. These gang members aren’t “at risk”—they’ve already embraced a life of violence and lawlessness. Mayor Emanuel, why not focus on those truly in danger: the everyday citizens trying to live their lives without fear? Why not implement real consequences for those carrying illegal weapons? Chicago may claim to be a safe city, but it’s filled with more guns than many countries struggling with war. Living in certain parts of the city feels like surviving in a war zone. The mayor wants more police, yet officers are being attacked, disrespected, and even killed by the very people they’re meant to protect. Take a page from Mayor Giuliani’s book and enforce a strict anti-crime policy—then watch crime rates fall. But empty promises won’t bring back the lives lost when a child is shot while walking home from school or a parent is killed just by stepping outside.

"So embarrassing for Hillary Clinton. In a small town in Ohio, Clinton was scheduled to hold a door-knocking event at noon. A Trump supporter, who had come to observe, showed up expecting to see a crowd. What he found was completely empty—no volunteers, no supporters, just a few staff members. When he asked where the others were, they quickly escorted him out. This mirrors what I saw on South Park last week when they joked that Clinton might only have a handful of real fans. It seems like that joke might not be so far off. With over 2 million people in the area, it's strange that no one showed up for the Hildabeast.  

From Gateway Pundit: At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign office, volunteers were expected to arrive in large numbers for the door-knocking event. Instead, a Trump supporter arrived and found the place nearly deserted. The only people present were the staff members running the operation. When he identified himself as a Trump supporter and asked where the volunteers were, the staff immediately told him to leave. The office was clean and well-organized, suggesting it was prepared for a big turnout. The lack of attendance suggests Clinton’s ground game is struggling. If this pattern holds in other states, she could face a major challenge against Trump.  

It’s hard not to wonder what kind of support she really has. While Trump’s events are packed with energy and excitement, Clinton’s seem to be lacking. Her campaign is spending millions to keep these offices running, but if there’s no real support, what’s the point? With Trump leading in polls, strong enthusiasm, and Clinton facing questions about her health and integrity, it’s starting to look like the tide may be turning. The Democrats must be worried—after all, Clinton was supposed to be the clear favorite. But where are the people?",1
"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. CNN (and increasingly, the other news networks) have been spreading anxiety for so long that they’ve turned into the very thing they claim to fight. Pope Francis agrees. Echoing Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous quote, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope criticized media that fuels panic. Reporting based on speculation or unverified claims is a form of “violence,” and outlets that spread prejudice against certain groups or stoke fear about immigrants are doing real harm, Pope Francis said on Tuesday. Spreading false information is an example of “terrorism, of how you can destroy someone with your words,” he added. “This is especially dangerous for journalists because their words can reach millions and that’s a powerful tool.” Source: BBC Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Spain and addressing Spanish media, which has its own issues with right-wing rhetoric, but I’m sure he hoped his message would cross the Atlantic. After all, CNN focuses mostly on alarm and that’s what has fueled the rise of figures like Donald Trump. Crime in the country is declining. An American’s chance of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million—about the same as being injured by a falling lamp. Still, Trump, encouraged by CNN, is making people terrified: Fear is everywhere, and it's growing. Americans are more anxious today than they've been in years, according to polls showing large majorities worried about terrorism and crime, with those numbers rising sharply over the past year to levels not seen in over a decade. Every week brings a new incident, whether it's a mass shooting, a protest, or a terror threat. Crime rates may be dropping, but the feeling of instability is constant. Source: The New York Times Sure, that’s about Trump, and the Pope wasn’t directly referring to him, but CNN is the fear machine. A report highlights multiple instances of CNN trying to terrify the public, and if this election and the polls are any indication, they’ve done just that.",1
"Scammer-turned-reality-TV-phenom-turned-Republican-presidential-candidate Donald Trump met with Fox News' Sean Hannity last night and launched a tirade against the U.S. military, a common tactic for a candidate trying to appeal to patriotic conservatives while running for president. During the interview, Trump criticized President Barack Obama and accused the military of being ""the group that can't aim straight,"" echoing a familiar attack on national leadership. In just 12 seconds, Trump used the word ""win"" or ""winning"" seven times, offering no real plan or strategy for achieving these so-called victories.  

Trump said, “I know how to win. I’ve always won. I win in business. I win in sports. I win,” he told Hannity. “But we don’t win. We don’t win in trade. We don’t win against ISIS. Can you imagine General Eisenhower or General Patton? They’d be turning in their graves watching how we fight.” He continued, “We announce our plans, everything is political, and then we bomb the wrong people. You saw it over the weekend. We bombed Syrian forces—more than 70 of them—and we didn’t even mean to.”  

The United States accidentally targeted Syrian government troops during an air strike in late September, mistaking them for ISIS fighters. “The U.S. has expressed regret through the Russian government for the unintended loss of life,” an administration source told *Mediaite* at the time. However, Russia, which appears eager for a Trump presidency, quickly blamed the Obama administration for aiding ISIS, despite having been consulted beforehand.  

Russian officials then spread a conspiracy theory blaming the U.S. for helping ISIS, claiming Assad has supported extremists with his air force and that Putin has allowed radicals to leave Russia for the front lines. Trump offered no alternative strategy to prevent such mistakes, instead repeating the word “win” over and over again, a phrase that resonates deeply with his base.  

Surprisingly, Sean Hannity remained silent after Trump’s remarks, a stark contrast to his usual energetic support. Meanwhile, the rest of the media waits for Hillary Clinton to make a move. Photo by Sara D. Davis via Getty.",1
"(CNN) The spectacle of political debates often diverts attention from real policy discussions — and the latest presidential showdown was no different, especially when it came to international matters. The exchange between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was more revealing in what was omitted — such as the situation in Afghanistan — than what was actually addressed. To be fair, the debate wasn’t meant to center on global issues, which were only briefly touched upon during the ""foreign policy"" segment. However, amid the discussion on terrorism, trade, and global alliances, there were fleeting moments that gave a glimpse into what foreign policy might look like under either candidate. QUIZ: Which candidate do you align with?  

Tackling Terrorism  
Throughout the debate, Trump primarily focused on undermining Clinton’s record — calling her experience “bad” — rather than outlining his own vision for dealing with global threats. This was especially true when it came to the topic of terrorism, which was mentioned 21 times during the foreign policy portion. Clinton emphasized the need to ""step up our drone strikes against terrorist groups,"" ""support regional partners,"" and ""target their leaders"" — positions that closely mirror President Obama’s current strategy.  

MORE: CNN fact-checks claims made by both candidates  
Trump criticized Clinton for allegedly enabling the rise of extremist groups by withdrawing from certain regions, but he never provided specifics about his so-called ""secret strategy"" to ""take out terrorists completely."" When Clinton questioned his lack of a plan, he responded: ""You're telling the enemy everything you want to do ... No wonder you've been fighting terrorism your whole life."" (Fact check: Terrorist groups like ISIS emerged after 2006, and Clinton was born in 1947.)  

The Iran Nuclear Agreement  
On the issue of Iran, Trump repeatedly condemned Clinton for signing what he called ""the worst deal ever made by any nation in history,"" claiming Iran was ""on the verge of collapse"" and now poses a growing threat. He didn’t offer much in the way of alternatives, other than suggesting that ""they should have included North Korea and Yemen in the negotiations.""

Support for International Alliances  
While Trump’s foreign policy remained vague, his remarks on U.S. alliances and NATO were striking. ""I want to help our allies, but we’re losing billions,"" he said. ""We can’t be the world’s policeman anymore."" His comments sent a clear signal to America’s",1
"CBS revealing that Obama funded the renovation of mosques abroad is actually an old story from 2015. It didn’t get much attention back then, but he’s still doing it. The administration is funneling hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to overseas mosques for restoration. Tell me again how he isn’t a Muslim — this clearly shows it. And people wonder why he bows to Iranian clerics… why he lets ISIS off the hook… why he's turning the U.S. into a Muslim country. Forget for a moment that we're in financial ruin due to decades of socialist policies… it’s the direction of the spending that should make you sick. We’re funding Islamic extremists left and right. We’re giving money to their countries, their schools, their mosques… even financing their wars against us.  

From TruthFeed: “You Didn’t Build That”… Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS report uncovered that the Obama State Department is sending millions of dollars to restore mosques in Muslim nations — angering fiscal watchdogs and raising serious concerns about aid going to groups potentially linked to terrorism. The U.S. ""investment"" in mosque renovations as a ""goodwill gesture"" has sparked outrage. ""We're spending money we don’t have. This is all on a massive credit card,"" said taxpayer advocate Sarah Mitchell. Additional funds have gone to locations like Turkey. The State Department shares before-and-after photos of mosques renovated with U.S. tax money. Many Americans lost everything during the last recession. One-third of the population is unemployed. We can't afford basic necessities, yet Obama is sending over $700 million to Islamic nations to fix their mosques. It’s absolutely outrageous.  

The State Department refused to comment on the CBS Atlanta News request. Anchor Maria Lee asked why we’re using taxpayer money to renovate religious structures overseas — something many Americans want to understand. In response, the State Department sent an email stating that they are “fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Muslim leaders.” What nonsense. Let me be clear: our wealth is being handed over to Islamists and their nations. Our treasury is being drained and given to enemies. Then we welcome these adversaries into our country and place them in positions of influence. Meanwhile, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants and settle them across the nation, especially in conservative areas, altering and controlling the voting base. This is a takeover from both inside and out… the enemy is now among us.",1
"I…just…can’t. This is complete chaos, and no matter how hard I try to make sense of this absurdity, I can’t even begin to comprehend it. I’m not saying I agree with everything, but I can see where the lawmakers are coming from. There are some white Americans who have a real fear of Police Officers and their authority. Their first reaction is often to comply—out of fear or respect. But is this really the solution? There are two sides to every story, and the new law only seems to favor one. It’s going to backfire eventually. In California, a judge just passed a new rule that gives white males special protection. The decision came from the State Supreme Court, so it’s now in effect and cannot be challenged. The question is, are citizens of CA now safer because of it? You decide. Being a Police Officer is an entirely different kind of job—one that civilians can’t even begin to understand. They don’t just wear a uniform; they carry the weight of public trust, danger, and responsibility. It’s not something you can just step into and fully grasp. That reality makes the recent attacks on officers even more unjust. As if their job wasn’t hard enough in this climate, now a judge has given an advantage to certain groups. If they feel they’re being unfairly stopped, they can now walk away. Yes, walk away from the Police, who are now powerless to do anything about it. And even if they run, it can’t be used as evidence against them in court. Before, if someone took off during an incident, that was considered “reasonable suspicion” and could justify a brief detention. Now, they’re prioritizing feelings over evidence. Basically, Police who are meant to protect and serve are now limited in their ability to do either—if someone chooses to run. Which, let’s be honest, what law-abiding person runs? The ones who don’t want trouble. Punchline: The smart ones! You’re welcome.",1
"Last Thursday, five individuals were fatally shot by a lone gunman at the Silver Lake Plaza in Spokane, Washington, just north of the Idaho border. The suspect, identified as Jamal Hassan, a Somali-born resident, was taken into custody shortly after the incident. Contrary to reports from major liberal outlets, he is not of Latino descent. Authorities have stated that the suspect's description came from eyewitness accounts. However, social media posts, including one from Jamal Hassan himself, contradict this, as seen below, with photos from the #SilverLakeShooting event: pic.twitter.com/9XpLw2QvD3 — The Patriot Post (@PatriotPost) October 1, 2016.  

Additional information has surfaced indicating that Hassan was linked to extremist groups and had expressed support for ISIS through online forums. He is reportedly on the FBI’s radar as a known radical Islamist. A report from The Daily Torch revealed content from his Instagram account where he referenced Islamic teachings and paradise. The suspect is currently held without bail on five counts of premeditated murder. He has a history of legal troubles, including multiple restraining orders and domestic abuse charges. As part of his court-mandated rehabilitation, he attended anger management and mental health sessions, which apparently failed to prevent this tragedy.  

While the attack appears to be another act of Islamic extremism, mainstream media has avoided labeling it as such. Law enforcement has also refrained from using that terminology. With the upcoming presidential debate, this incident is expected to influence the conversation, whether by shaping the debate’s focus or highlighting issues related to gun control and national security.",1
"Some athletes have been making bold statements during games to express their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. However, not all players agree with the methods being used. Cam Newton, the former quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, has spoken out against the unrest in Charlotte, where he lives. He claims the recent protests have led to chaos, with businesses destroyed, police injured, and at least one death reported. Newton called for a press conference to address the situation and expressed frustration with how some in the black community have responded to the shooting of a black man by police — the incident that sparked the demonstrations. “I’m an African American, and I’m not happy with how justice has been handled over the years,” he said. “But we also need to take responsibility as a community. We can’t be hypocrites.” He criticized the violence that has emerged from the protests, saying, “When someone commits an unjust act or kills an innocent person, it’s serious. I have kids, and I don’t want them to ever wonder what happened to their dad.” Newton also accused the Black Lives Matter movement of focusing too much on race. “It doesn’t matter what color you are,” he said. “I can look at someone and tell if they’re a good person. There are good people without badges and good people with badges.” He defended the police, stating, “Not all cops are bad. We all know people in law enforcement who are doing the right thing.” But it was his comments about the black community that drew the most backlash. “Look at the most dangerous cities in America — places like Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans,” he said. “As a black person, I’ve seen how some in our community don’t act right by each other. You can’t just blame everything on white people or the police.” His message, though controversial, reflects a perspective that many feel is needed.",1
"CHICAGO — As the race tightens across the country and in key swing states, Joe Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, released a confidential report to donors, volunteers, and senior staff last week outlining the Democratic nominee’s potential routes to victory in November, alongside an assessment of President Donald Trump’s weak position. “The truth that no poll can capture: Joe Biden has multiple paths to 270 electoral votes, while Trump has very limited options. Biden is all but guaranteed to win 15 ‘blue' states, including Illinois, which would give him 182 electoral votes,” writes Dillon in the 1,800-word memo, which was shared widely on Sunday evening and later obtained by The Chicago Tribune. “If we add the five states that FiveThirtyEight gives Biden a 70% or higher chance of winning (Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa), Biden only needs 10 more electoral votes.”

At a time when Democrats are growing increasingly uneasy about the race — especially after recent polls showed Trump gaining ground — Dillon outlines the possible ways Biden could secure the remaining 10 votes: capturing Georgia’s 16 electoral votes, Arizona’s 11, or New Mexico’s 5, or any combination of Nevada, Colorado, or Maine. “In other words, Biden could win just one of these states — Georgia, Arizona, or New Mexico — and still take the presidency, meaning the others would simply add to his total,” he writes. “Trump, however, must win at least four of these five states, including Georgia and Arizona — and he can’t afford to lose any of them.”

Dillon’s analysis aligns with what many Democratic strategists have been emphasizing for months, though it contrasts with the Trump campaign’s focus on Pennsylvania as a critical battleground. Biden’s team has also focused heavily on that state, believing it will go his way, but acknowledging that without it, Trump’s chances are slim.

Titled “60 days until Election Day,” the memo serves as both a reassurance and a call to action, aiming to ease concerns among party members who are worried that Trump is closing the gap — Biden’s lead in the RealClearPolitics average has dropped from 6.2 points in early September to just 1.4 points. It also encourages volunteers to intensify their efforts in the final stretch, highlighting Biden’s policy agenda and standard criticisms of Trump, including referencing",1
"In this video we shared yesterday, Clinton seems to have difficulty maintaining eye contact. Shortly after this incident, she abruptly canceled her high-profile fundraiser in North Carolina, which was set to take place just miles from where the footage was captured. But the situation is more troubling than it appears, as one of our investigators uncovered some concerning details about Hillary Clinton's recent schedule. Here's an interesting point: I looked up all of Hillary Clinton’s public events between September 20 and October 19 — she has only one rally scheduled. All the rest are fundraisers, and she isn’t listed as a speaker at any of them. Meanwhile, Trump has four rallies planned between September 20 and 22.  

There are growing concerns about her health, and while I’m not a medical professional, I see what’s happening. I recently posted that Hillary Clinton required Secret Service assistance to climb two steps at a recent event. How many healthy individuals need help climbing two steps? And the agent had a tight grip on her left arm. I also predicted that Clinton would struggle to conceal her condition, and that a breakdown was inevitable. Additional rumors suggest the DNC is in disarray, with potential substitutes for Clinton being considered. The Democrats are facing a serious challenge, as Sanders continues to act as a loyal supporter of Clinton rather than a genuine presidential candidate.  

As for Clinton’s health, whether you believe in the eye movements or the conspiracy theories, there’s no denying she’s unwell. The Left can’t keep this hidden forever, and it will prove all the ""conspirators"" right. The health scandal will expose to the American public what many already suspect about Democrats — they’re corrupt to the core. More revelations are expected in the coming days.",1
"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) allegedly provided “weakened” HIV/AIDS medications to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risk of illness and death, according to a preliminary congressional investigation obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The report, titled *""The Clinton Foundation and the India Connection,""* was spearheaded by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI initiative, which aimed to support AIDS patients, is one of the Clinton Foundation’s most well-known programs. The investigation centered on Clinton’s long-standing partnership with a controversial Indian pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy, which supplied HIV/AIDS drugs to developing nations. It also highlighted the role of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a prominent whistleblower and helped the U.S. government initiate a major legal action against the firm. Ranbaxy faced U.S. prosecution due to its sales of generic drugs in the American market. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including fraud and distributing substandard drugs, and was fined $500 million. ""This case represents the largest false claims prosecution in the District of Maryland and the biggest financial penalty ever imposed on a generic drug company,"" said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein at the time. ""When companies distribute contaminated or ineffective drugs, they compromise the FDA’s approval process and put patients at serious risk,"" added Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice. The report stated that the Department of Justice alleged Ranbaxy's diluted medications ""increased the risk of harm and death"" among patients. Blackburn questioned, ""How many lives were lost because of this? How many people were misled?"" The possibility that CHAI distributed compromised HIV medications could damage the reputation of the Clinton charity and raise new concerns during Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Blackburn submitted the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State, where Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. The study also revealed troubling connections between Bill Clinton and two Indian-American figures who had previously faced regulatory actions from the FDA and SEC. The most alarming findings involved the Clinton Foundation’s continued promotion of Ranbaxy despite evidence of repeated quality control failures and attempts to conceal them through misleading reports to the FDA. It remains unclear how many AIDS patients received these weakened",1
"When Joe Biden expressed support for Senator Elizabeth Warren, many were taken aback. Progressives viewed it as a sign of solidarity with their movement and a boost for her campaign. Conservatives, on the other hand, saw it as a shocking betrayal and a puzzling shift.

It’s about a rebellion against the political elite from both sides.” He added, “Behind the scenes, there’s still an unspoken agreement between the parties. They may clash publicly, but they share the same interests in Washington.” Luntz also provided insights into upcoming elections.

"Oh Donald, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t claim victory when the results are still unclear. The latest polls from Tuesday’s debate show mixed reactions. At first glance, they don’t look great for Hillary Clinton. According to focus groups from MSNBC and ABC, both had Donald Trump leading in Tuesday’s presidential debate. But were these groups representative of the broader electorate? According to focus groups at both MSNBC and ABC, Republican candidate Donald Trump narrowly beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the debate. At MSNBC, the group was split 14-6 in favor of Trump. And at ABC, pollster John Zogby’s group came out 13-7 in favor of the businessman. MSNBC’s group consisted of voters from Michigan, while Zogby’s group included voters from Ohio. Zogby, who followed the debate closely, noted that Trump gained momentum when he attacked Clinton on her email issue but struggled when defending his comments about Obama’s citizenship.

This is absolutely unacceptable. These “demonstrators” are nothing more than thugs hiding behind a cause. The media, who once condemned the Tea Party, now say, “No one condones this violence, but…” But what? There’s no excuse for this kind of brutality. Everyone involved in this chaos should be arrested without hesitation. No exceptions. No explanations. This behavior has been encouraged by leaders like Barack Obama, who, back in 2009, wrongly criticized the Cambridge Police. He created the environment that allowed this violence to flourish. It’s also on the shoulders of figures like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton, who fueled the “hands up, don’t shoot” myth from Ferguson. Pray for the injured cameraman and all journalists facing threats while doing their job. Another reporter was shoved to the ground earlier. How does this “start a dialogue” or gain sympathy? Don’t tell",1
"What emerged, however, was in structure and visual style reminiscent of previous debates — two individuals behind podiums — only this time featuring a veteran statesman and an inexperienced candidate. And it was Trump, expected to shine with charisma, who at times appeared unsettled, one of several distractions that had less to do with the substance of his remarks than with how he delivered them. The back-and-forth didn’t result in a standout performance, to be sure, as political spectacle. But for those who believed that hosting ""The Apprentice"" would prepare Trump for this kind of event, it turns out that the skills required were quite different from what he needed on that night. Clinton, clearly, entered the debate with a clear plan: to appear composed, confident, and largely unbothered by Trump’s comments, while slipping in a few well-rehearsed jabs. This included mentioning that she had thoroughly prepared for the debate, offering a sharp contrast to some of Trump's scattered responses. There were also effective moments, such as when she responded to one of Trump's long-winded answers by saying, ""Just listen to what you just heard."" Related: One thing Clinton and Trump didn't debate: the debate itself. Trump, on the other hand, having faced numerous opponents during the primary season, seemed out of place in this one-on-one setting. With so many candidates on stage before, his aggressive style stood out; here, with only Clinton to contend with, it was harder to maintain that same approach. He interrupted Clinton frequently — initially to make a point, but as the debate continued, those interruptions increasingly felt like frustration, as if the attack ads she had been running against him (which he mentioned) had gotten under his skin. Trump’s persistent coughing throughout also became a distraction — not a major issue in theory, but one that social media was quick to mock. His attempts to dominate certain topics created challenges for the third participant in this mini-drama, Lester Holt. Holt, the ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor, faced perhaps the most difficult task imaginable, given all the anticipation beforehand and the inevitable post-debate analysis. Holt handled himself adequately, occasionally fact-checking Trump’s claims — especially when he tried to deny direct quotes attributed to him — and pushing him for concrete answers. Those moments when he challenged the candidate may not have gone over well with Trump's most loyal supporters, but Holt avoided the role of a passive moderator who simply asks questions and stays out",1
"What would you do if a group of angry people blocked your path on the road? You slow down, trying to see if they’ll let you pass, but instead of moving, they start walking toward you. You remember the incident in which a man was attacked by a crowd, and now you're faced with a choice: try to drive through and risk harming someone, or stop and risk being attacked yourself. What’s your move? Maybe it's how I was raised, but I've always believed that when your life is in danger, your first priority has to be survival. I'm not alone in that thinking. A recent event at the University of Wisconsin shows just how dangerous it can be to block a road with protests. In the video below, you can see a group of demonstrators taking over the street. But one driver clearly has somewhere to go. Instead of stopping, they speed forward, knocking over a protester. Watch the video below:  
Some say the protest was about police brutality, but that’s not what this was about. The group was upset over racist graffiti that had been painted on the university walls—words like “KKK” and “Go back to Africa.” The message was removed, and the school apologized, but the anger didn’t fade. Black Lives Matter activists were furious. Let’s be clear—there’s no shame in putting your own safety first. It’s better to risk hitting someone than to be hurt or robbed by a group that thinks they’re entitled to take from you. As the saying goes, “Better to be judged by 12 than carried by six.” This isn’t just about protecting your home—it’s about protecting yourself. When you’re surrounded by an angry crowd that wants violence, there’s no good reason to stop. What would you do in that situation? Would you keep going, or would you hit the brakes?",1
"We’ve all seen political promises that backfire. One of the most infamous was “read my lips…no new taxes,” which helped George H.W. Bush win an election but ultimately led to the largest tax hike in history. Now, Donald Trump has made a statement that could rival that fiasco. In response to the weekend attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, he promised to “destroy the threat of terrorism” in America. But what does that really mean?  

Take a look at this statement from @JasonMillerinDC:  
Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016  

While the attacks were tragic, Trump didn’t offer a realistic plan to combat terrorism—no strategy for countering online radicalization, no proposal for increasing counterterrorism funding. Instead, he spoke about “destroying” terrorists and ending the threat “on our soil.” That kind of language is dangerous. It implies a broad, sweeping approach that could lead to racial or religious profiling.  

Consider the case of a suspect being investigated by the FBI. He may be a Muslim, but he's also an American citizen with rights. Under Trump’s rhetoric, he might be treated as a target without due process. This kind of blanket statement opens the door to a new kind of fear-based policy—one that could lead to increased surveillance in Muslim communities, mass detention, or even worse.  

If you think this is just political hyperbole, consider the implications. Trump’s words suggest a vision where terrorism is not just fought, but eradicated through extreme measures. That kind of mindset is not only unrealistic—it’s reminiscent of authoritarian tactics. The promise to “destroy” terrorism sounds appealing to some, but it’s more likely another empty slogan designed to play on fear rather than address real problems.  

Like so many of his campaign promises, this one is more about emotion than substance. And just like the “read my lips” line, it’s probably another empty promise that will collapse under scrutiny. The truth is, terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” with a catchy phrase. It takes real policy, real leadership, and real solutions—not fearmongering.",1
"Since the Nixon era, Americans have been fed a narrative that suggests inherited wealth is more legitimate than income earned through work. Republicans push for complete tax exemption on all inheritances, while Democrats generally oppose this stance. The current system taxes only estates worth $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples), leaving everything below that untouched. Now, Joe Biden, under pressure from progressive voices like Elizabeth Warren and her supporters, has updated his approach to estate taxation—and let me tell you, the children of billionaires won’t be pleased. Initially, Biden proposed reinstating the 2009 estate tax rate of 40 percent, lowering the threshold to $3.5 million. But now, he’s shifted course, adopting a plan similar to his former rival, and is pushing for a progressive estate tax that increases the top rate to 65 percent. The last time the tax reached such a level was in 1981, when it also applied to smaller estates. In addition, Biden has indicated he would eliminate the ""step-up in basis"" rule, which lets heirs avoid capital gains taxes on assets they inherit. Overall, the proposal is expected to generate roughly $200 billion over the next decade. Source: The New Republic  
Currently, the estate tax system is a farce. In 2015, over $1.4 trillion was transferred through inheritance, with less than 1 percent actually taxed. The Republican claim that estate taxes harm small businesses is misleading—only 25 family-owned farms and small businesses paid estate taxes nationwide in 2014. Another common argument is that estate taxes constitute ""double taxation,"" but this ignores the fact that much of the wealth in large estates comes from untaxed capital gains. Even if Biden wins, passing this reform will be difficult, especially with Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate. He wants to ensure that the offspring of the wealthy pay nothing in estate taxes. And let's not forget—Biden himself may not pay any taxes at all.",1
"I woke up this morning to see a similar headline trending on my social media: Here’s Facebook: Naturally, my first thought was, “Oh no, what did Bill Clinton do this time to mess up his wife’s campaign?” The headline sounded extremely damaging, playing right into the narrative that the Clinton Foundation is all about backdoor deals — something Trump has been repeating for years. But if you look past the headlines, which most people don’t, you’ll find the truth — there’s no evidence of any pay-to-play scheme. “It was normal for people who were our allies and friends to reach out and ask for help,” Clinton said in an interview with *The New York Times* last week. “And I assumed the State Department would handle things appropriately.” Source: *The Daily Beast* In short, people might have made requests, but that doesn’t mean they received favors. Emails released during the investigation show that some donors met with Clinton, while others were denied. There's no proof that anything was exchanged for influence. Meanwhile, let's not forget about the foundation the media rarely brings up — the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn't contributed to it since 2008, but he's collected money from others and used it under his name. Reports suggest he spent charity funds on personal items like a $15,000 portrait of himself and a custom football helmet. New York Attorney General Letitia James recently stated that her office is looking into Trump’s charitable organization, citing concerns over potential violations of state charity laws. This comes after *The Washington Post* reported that Trump allegedly used donor money for personal gain, including reselling contributions to make them look like they came from him. Source: *Media Matters* Media Matters highlights the unfair double standard in how the press covers Trump and Clinton. Last month, TV news outlets covered Clinton’s brief illness more than 10 times as much as they covered the Trump Foundation story. This week, coverage of Trump’s charity issues was minimal compared to the attention given to his appearance on *The Dr. Oz Show*. This biased reporting is helping Trump and hurting Clinton. Trump has gained significant momentum lately, partly because the media focuses on every small Clinton issue — like her health — while ignoring the many controversies surrounding Trump, which are numerous.",1
"I’d say our leader is ineffective, but this goes way beyond that — it's outright indifference. He’s made some questionable decisions and said a few thoughtless things in the past, but this? This is just out of touch in the worst way. If you're following the news, you already know about the shootings in Chicago and Dallas last week, plus the fire at the courthouse in Atlanta. You'd expect someone in his position to at least acknowledge these tragedies, especially when they happened on American soil. You'd hope the people who elected him would show some compassion, even if it's just for political reasons. But apparently, our leader doesn’t see it that way. Instead of addressing the violence unfolding across the country, he spent the weekend at a private event with wealthy donors. Are you frustrated yet? It gets worse. Rather than offering condolences to the victims, he focused on criticizing ""the media"" for supposedly undermining his campaign, blaming outlets like Fox News and CNN for spreading false narratives. He attacked his opponents while praising his allies, all while ignoring the real human cost of the recent incidents. Some might argue he didn’t have the full story, but you don’t need every detail to say, “A shooting has taken place in Dallas, and I want to express my support for the victims and their families. I’ll provide more updates as I get them.” But no, he didn’t even do that. Unbelievable.",1
"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were once considered one of Hollywood's most iconic power couples. However, it seems their relationship has come to an end: Angelina Jolie has officially filed for divorce. At 41, Jolie cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for ending her two-year marriage to Pitt. The couple first met in 2004 while filming *Mr. and Mrs. Smith*, at a time when Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston. They divorced in early 2005, and just months later, Pitt and Jolie began dating, with Jolie introducing him to their adopted son Maddox. She later adopted a daughter from Ethiopia and became pregnant with Pitt’s child. The pair welcomed another adopted child in 2007 and then had twins in 2008.  

Although they were together since 2004, the couple didn’t get engaged until 2012, reportedly waiting to marry until same-sex couples could also legally wed. Some sources claim Jolie was frustrated with Pitt’s parenting methods, feeling he wasn’t always reliable around the kids, was upset about his alleged drug use, and believed he had unresolved anger issues. It’s also been said that Jolie hired a private investigator to monitor Pitt during the filming of his latest project in London, suspecting he was being unfaithful. Those concerns were reportedly confirmed by the investigator.  

Jolie is widely recognized for her humanitarian efforts and serves as a United Nations special envoy, recently addressing the UN on behalf of Syrian refugees. Meanwhile, Pitt was said to be more focused on his film career and social life. According to reports, Jolie is seeking full custody of their six children, with Pitt limited to visitation rights. She is being represented by attorney Laura Wasser, who previously handled Amber Heard’s divorce from Johnny Depp.",1
"If Donald Trump gets his way, the constitutional right to due process will only apply to people who look like him. Following the attack in Chicago last week, authorities arrested a man named Mohamed Farooq after a violent confrontation. Farooq was injured and taken to the hospital for treatment of his wounds. As an American citizen, he is also entitled to legal representation, even if he can't afford it. This is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. However, Republican candidate Donald Trump has criticized the handling of Farooq's case, claiming that he is receiving too much care and legal support. At a campaign event in Ohio, Trump expressed frustration over the suspect being treated by top doctors and having a strong defense attorney. ""We're giving him amazing medical care, a nice room, maybe even room service. And he's got a great lawyer who will drag this out for years. In the end, he might walk away with just a slap on the wrist. What a disgrace,"" Trump said. He also called for quick trials and harsh sentencing, suggesting that ""any legal methods"" should be used to extract information from the suspect before it's too late. Here's the video via YouTube. The Fifth Amendment states: No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. Farooq is innocent until proven guilty, so denying him proper medical care could result in serious harm or even death, violating his right to due process. The Sixth Amendment ensures that everyone has the right to a lawyer, regardless of the crime they're accused of. This principle is deeply rooted in American history, as seen in the actions of Thomas Jefferson, who defended British soldiers after the Boston Massacre. In short, no one should be denied their legal rights based on their background or religion. But Trump seems to want to rewrite the Constitution to favor only certain people.",1
"Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has always been open about his deep faith and commitment to helping others. For him, serving his community and guiding people toward a more meaningful life is just as important as his role on the football field. Off the field, Wilson focuses on spreading hope and positivity through his actions, believing that true joy comes from making good choices and having faith in something greater. On the field, he's all about winning, but off the field, his mission is clear: to inspire others to find peace and purpose. When the NFL asked him to refrain from discussing his faith, it didn’t stop him from sharing his message. He believes that actions speak louder than words. Wilson has often said that God comes first in his life, followed by family and friends, and then football. This order, he says, keeps him grounded and focused. “Faith is everything to me,” he once said. “If you put things in the right order, good things happen. You don’t get caught up in the noise.” It’s inspiring to see someone with such influence using their platform for good. Unfortunately, many in positions of power start with good intentions but eventually lose sight of what truly matters. They begin to seek recognition for themselves instead of staying true to their roots. Some might call it luck, but I think it’s more about character. In a world where corruption is widespread and truth is often twisted, it’s rare to see someone like Wilson who remains steadfast in his beliefs. The NFL told him to stay quiet about his faith—strange how some things are treated as sensitive while others are not. It’s one thing to avoid talking about God, but it’s another to ignore the values that have shaped our country and its heroes. In this climate, the truth becomes harder to see. Words like “tolerance” are used to blur the lines between right and wrong. When men like Wilson stand firm in their convictions, they face strong opposition. Ask yourself, when did doing good and helping others become a bad thing? There’s only one force that seeks to prevent good from happening. And in Obama’s America, it seems many have forgotten that truth.",1
"Paul Combetta, an IT professional who assisted Hillary Clinton in removing sensitive data from her server as requested by federal investigators, turned to online message boards seeking guidance on how to manipulate emails. Combetta invoked his Fifth Amendment rights when questioned by a congressional panel last week, yet he was surprisingly open when asking other IT professionals for advice on altering Clinton’s correspondence. Under a post on 8chan titled “Here is clear evidence that Hillary tried to erase records,” Combetta used the username “stonetear” — a handle he frequently employs across various platforms. In a screenshot of the conversation, Combetta (or stonetear) can be seen asking, “I need to remove a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a set of archived messages.” It’s widely assumed that the VIP in question was Secretary of State Clinton.

"Doesn't this outrage you, just a little? The way the NFL and college athletes are treating the national anthem these days, especially with the Black Lives Matter movement, it's like nothing can stop them. But when someone speaks out against BLM, they get punished—like a full season suspension. Seattle Mariners' star pitcher Jake Reynolds was just suspended for criticizing Black Lives Matter and President Obama. ""BLM is a joke! Obama is a disgrace! Everyone involved in these riots should be thrown in jail!"" he wrote on his social media. He also posted, ""Black people attacking whites after a black officer shot a thug—haha, that’s funny! Keep kneeling for the anthem!"" The team released a statement on Thursday saying he would be suspended for the rest of the season without pay. According to reports, Reynolds could lose around $40,000 in earnings. And naturally, the apology followed. In a statement, Reynolds said, ""I want to sincerely apologize to the Seattle Mariners, my teammates, my family, and the fans for the distraction my tweets caused. I never intended to be offensive or racist. My comments were in response to what I saw on the news and were poorly worded. I understand how they could be misinterpreted."" ""I grew up in Chicago, a city I love, and I was raised in a diverse neighborhood. I’ve always valued people for who they are, not what color they are. My friends have never been defined by race, and I’ve never been judgmental. I just hope people don’t judge me based on one tweet."" ""I believe in free speech and supporting law enforcement. I’m frustrated by what’s happening in the world and want to be part of the solution. I hope we can all work together to make things better."" ""Once again, I apologize to anyone I may have offended and ask that you not judge me based on social media. Thank you and God bless."" While BLM continues to cause chaos, destroy property, and put police in danger, they still get support from officials like DC saying, ""We feel your pain."" Meanwhile, this guy gets hit with a severe punishment for just expressing his views online. Sometimes I really wish this world was different—and this is one of those times.",1
"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign is in chaos, and he's trying to squeeze as much public funding as possible before facing a decisive defeat at the polls by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. According to recent FEC disclosures, Trump's team has allegedly bilked the U.S. Secret Service out of $1.6 million for the ""privilege"" of guarding him. The Secret Service typically reimburses campaigns for the costs associated with agents traveling with candidates, usually covering airfare and then being repaid by the campaign. However, Trump has exploited this system by using his own company, TAG Air, Inc., to charter flights for the Secret Service, effectively allowing him to profit from the arrangement. In contrast, Clinton’s campaign has used Executive Fliteways, a company with no ties to her or her team, ensuring no personal financial gain. While Trump supporters would surely be furious if Clinton were benefiting from such arrangements, their outrage seems to be selective. Trump’s campaign maintains that all actions were fully compliant with FEC rules. A spokesperson, Hope Hicks, stated, “We followed all guidelines and regulations. For more information, please contact the Secret Service.” Additionally, there are reports that Trump may be extracting money from media outlets for the travel expenses of journalists accompanying his campaign. It’s also rumored that the Secret Service has been forced to pay for Trump’s stays at his luxurious gold-plated hotels, as he often chooses to stay at his own properties, reportedly due to his preference for the cheapest Chinese-made beds available.",1
"WSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage showing Keith Scott exiting his vehicle with a weapon in hand and moving toward law enforcement. Authorities are withholding the video for now… they aren’t allowed to release it. This is an internal affairs matter, and the footage will be presented in court. Until legal clearance is given, the video remains sealed. According to sources, Scott was wearing a leg holster containing a firearm, which he drew as officers approached him. His claim that he didn’t recognize them as police won’t stand—officers clearly identified themselves and ordered him out of the car. No book was discovered at the scene. The narrative being spread by his family to incite racial tension and unrest is false. From Gateway Pundit: Charlotte police have obtained video of Keith Scott leaving his car, walking toward officers, and holding a gun. Meanwhile, race-fueled protests have escalated into violence, with demonstrators attacking police, reporters, and even looting stores, including the Hornets’ team shop. [...] Protest organizers are urging the public to resist. After Scott confronted an officer with a weapon and was killed. [...] Scott wasn’t carrying a book. He had a gun and a leg holster. One protester is currently in critical condition after two nights of chaos, having been shot in the head by another rioter. Both police and demonstrators have been hospitalized, and the situation continues to deteriorate. The governor has declared a state of emergency in Charlotte, and the National Guard has been deployed. A curfew is under consideration. Scott advanced on the officers before being fatally shot. Chief Kerr Putney stated that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that he refused to drop it when instructed. The officer followed protocol and acted appropriately. But it doesn’t matter—any excuse will do, any falsehood will do to spark a racial conflict and riots. Charlotte is proof of that. For now, the unrest persists, and with this pace, more bloodshed is inevitable. Looting is widespread, and media personnel have been targeted and assaulted. A photographer was pushed to the ground, and protesters attempted to throw him into a fire. This is the disorder and destruction Obama has been promoting in our cities. It’s about to get much worse.",1
"Congressional investigators and intelligence agencies are looking into whether one of Donald Trump’s so-called foreign policy ""advisors"" has been engaging in secret conversations with senior Russian government officials, some of whom are currently under U.S. sanctions. According to several sources, these discussions have reportedly focused on the potential for a future Trump administration to remove the economic penalties imposed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, an act that Trump has consistently refused to condemn. The adviser in question, Michael Flynn, is a former military official who previously worked as a consultant for a Washington-based firm specializing in energy sector relations with Russian entities. He is based just a few blocks from Trump's office in New York. Flynn was first publicly named by Trump in March as part of his ""foreign policy team,"" a group that includes conservative military figures, Middle Eastern sympathizers, and former officials from Iraq. Since then, he has become one of Trump’s most visible foreign policy voices, though the campaign insists he is not officially affiliated with the ticket. Flynn has deep financial ties to Russia, including investments in Rosneft, the country’s largest private oil company, and has frequently traveled to Moscow for meetings with high-ranking Russian officials. A U.S. diplomat in Moscow described him as “unapologetic in defending Russian actions.” Particular attention is being paid to Flynn’s trip to Moscow in May, where he met with Sergey Ivanov, a long-time Putin ally and former deputy prime minister who now serves as an advisor to Rosneft and is under U.S. sanctions. According to multiple U.S. officials in the region, Flynn reportedly discussed with Ivanov strategies to lift the American sanctions, a move that would significantly benefit his business interests. Earlier this year, Flynn told a news outlet that “many of my contacts have suffered due to the sanctions” and expressed hope for “a more favorable environment.” During that same trip, Flynn also met with Alexei Gromov, a top Kremlin official involved in shaping Russia’s election interference strategy, according to U.S. intelligence assessments. The initial inquiry into Flynn stemmed from the congressional probe into Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee and voter systems in several U.S. states. While Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have concluded that Russian intelligence agencies are actively working to sway the U.S. election—actions they say only come from the highest levels of the Russian government—Trump has shown no typical bravado in the face of this unprecedented",1

I have always been a strong supporter of your leadership and policies. However, your recent hesitation to openly back the Republican Party and its candidates has left me puzzled and concerned. Your quiet stance while key Republicans, including your father, have aligned with the opposition makes me question your commitment and direction. History has shown that silence can lead to dangerous consequences. It would be alarming to elect a leader who continues to weaken the values we stand for. As mentioned, I want to buy your artwork – but not if it represents a shift away from traditional American principles. I wish to remain a supporter of the Trump family, but I need to see where your loyalty truly lies. Please clearly state to the nation that you will uphold your legacy by standing firm against progressive forces and defending conservative ideals. The erosion of our country’s strength is accelerating and must be reversed. I await your response.",1
"Donald Trump took to the airwaves on Monday morning and blamed the recent attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, insufficient law enforcement screening, and the First Amendment. Conservatives, he claimed, always bypass the First Amendment and focus only on the Second. While Trump criticized refugees, the bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is actually a naturalized U.S. citizen. During a segment on Fox & Friends, a host asked Trump how he would stop ""radicalized individuals here."" In response, Trump pointed the finger at ""freedom of the press,"" claiming, ""They're all talking about it so beautifully because it's called 'freedom of the press,' where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these bombs that I saw."" He added, ""They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people who do that because they're committing a crime. Instead, they say, 'Oh no, you can't do anything—this is freedom of expression.'"" He continued, ""The websites are the same thing; those people should be arrested. They're inciting violence, okay? They're making violence possible. They should be arrested immediately… yet we don’t want to touch them because of freedom of speech."" Watch the full exchange around the 21-minute mark: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8] However, incitement is already an exception under the First Amendment. Think Progress notes that proving incitement is a high standard—and Trump may have good reason to be thankful for that. Under a more lenient interpretation, he could potentially face charges for his own rhetoric. Earlier this year, his comment that ""Second Amendment people"" might take action against Hillary Clinton drew sharp criticism as a veiled threat. On Friday, he urged Clinton’s security team to ""disarm immediately,"" adding, ""Let’s see what happens to her."" Trump has frequently attacked the freedom of the press. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter detained. The GOP nominee has also defended Vladimir Putin for killing journalists. When confronted by Joe Scarborough about Putin’s record with media, Trump said, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader. Unlike what we have here."" Freedom of the press is part of the Constitution. It's not up for debate—unless Melania Trump wants to sue bloggers for quoting sources. But if you ask Donald Trump Jr",1
"On Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) took to Twitter to reference the arrest of a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as a way to subtly criticize NFL quarterback Tom Brady, in what appeared to be a poorly timed effort to link Brady’s recent social activism with acts of violence. Rubio tweeted “You’re welcome” following the announcement of Tsarnaev’s capture, seemingly implying that Brady should be grateful for the country’s security efforts. Rubio likely expected the tweet to position him as a voice of reason and highlight his stance on law and order, but instead, the internet quickly turned against him. His passive-aggressive jab was swiftly labeled as “Thanks, Brady” by online critics, drawing comparisons to the “Thanks, Obama” trend that once mocked conservative attempts to tie unrelated events to presidential policies. The tweet gained traction among several high-profile accounts, including CNN’s Anderson Cooper, who briefly shared it, amplifying the backlash. In the end, Rubio’s attempt to make a political point backfired spectacularly, and many are hoping he takes the lesson to heart—instead of using national tragedies to boost his own image.",1
"It almost breaks my heart to admit it, but Israel might just have the ONLY leader on the planet with real backbone. Don’t get me wrong – Benjamin Netanyahu is one of my top picks when it comes to global leaders. I just wish more countries had someone as bold, principled, and resilient as him. Instead, we’re stuck with a president who seems more concerned with fashion than foreign policy. Today, Bibi addressed the United Nations General Assembly, which isn’t exactly an easy task for someone in his position. After all, an organization that puts representatives from nations that deny Israel’s right to exist in powerful roles isn’t exactly going to be welcoming. But here’s the thing – when you're speaking to people who hate you and your country, you’re basically free to say what you want. And that's exactly what Bibi did. Here's a clip of his speech – Here’s more of his speech – Focusing on science, security, and agricultural innovation, Netanyahu said that while the UN certainly deserves every criticism it has received, he believes Israeli expertise in these areas could help reshape its role in international diplomacy. Shortly after warning diplomats that their voting habits on Israel would soon change, Netanyahu openly referred to several Arab nations as “partners in peace, stability, and security.” “For the first time in my life, many countries in the region are recognizing that Israel isn’t their enemy — they see us as allies,” he said. “Our shared enemies are Iran and extremism, and our shared goals are peace and progress.” “I hope that in the future we can work together openly,” he added, essentially bringing regional cooperation into the light. In his speech, just days after meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama during the General Assembly, Netanyahu emphasized the “unshakeable relationship” between the two nations. “Our bond with the U.S. goes beyond politics or party lines,” he stated. “It’s rooted in the strong support for Israel among the American public, which is at an all-time high, and for that we’re deeply grateful.” The reality is that women and minorities in Israel enjoy more freedom than anywhere else in the Middle East, which really rattles regimes like Saudi Arabia and Syria. They use the UN as a platform to attack Israel for giving its citizens true freedom, rather than forcing them to live under oppressive religious rule. But just for fun — compare what women in Israel can achieve (something Netanyahu highlighted in his speech) to what women in Saudi",1
"What do Tom Brady and Russell Wilson have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL anymore. The other difference is that Tom Brady is a champion and highly admired. The other is a fraud. Tom Brady was very brief when a reporter asked him about Russell Wilson's recent comments on social injustice and the treatment of minorities in America. Brady is known for his leadership, calm demeanor, and ability to win games. His response to Wilson’s remarks was as follows… “When people have strong opinions,” said Brady, “it’s important to express them, but it’s also important to do so with respect and consideration.” The key word here is “respect,” which Wilson seems to be missing, especially given that he’s still getting paid to sit on the bench. He’s a high-earning backup who doesn’t seem to care about the fans or the values this country stands for. If he wants to speak out, that’s fine, but he should do it outside of the stadium, not during the national anthem. He can take to social media, join a peaceful protest, or even go to a community event. There are plenty of ways to make a statement without undermining the game or the flag. And let’s not forget that no one in this country is truly oppressed. Saying you're oppressed is just an excuse for not working hard enough. How did Martin Luther King Jr. achieve his goals? Was he oppressed? He fought for change, not handouts. The guy worked for what he got, so he wasn’t oppressed. Name one person who actually is oppressed, and I’ll show you why they’re not making the most of their opportunities. I can tell you what they could be doing instead of blaming others. If anyone is really oppressed, it’s the people who lost out because of policies meant to help others. Tom Brady didn’t say much because he knows better than to get caught up in controversy. He’s focused on his future and helping the team he’s on. Good for Brady, and I hope he finds a new role where he can continue to lead. Screw Wilson.",1
"Newly uncovered video has added alarming details to a 2011 police shooting in St. Louis, revealing an officer fatally shooting a Black man and then placing a weapon at the scene.

Additional footage now shows Stockley retrieving a gun from a bag in the back of his patrol car and placing it on Smith’s body. Stockley claimed in his report that Smith had aimed the gun at him, justifying the deadly action. However, DNA testing on the weapon found no traces of Smith’s genetic material or fingerprints.

"Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile appeared on CNN’s “Early Start” Monday and addressed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s sudden decline on September 11. What was meant to be a supportive comment quickly became an unexpected revelation about the seriousness of Clinton’s condition that day. “She had to be helped into the vehicle, but she still showed up and kept going, just like all of us do,” Brazile said, as reported by The Daily Caller. This is the first time a member of Clinton's team has openly acknowledged that the former secretary of state required assistance getting into the van, which raises serious questions about her physical stability. What seemed like a praise turned into a damaging admission for the campaign. Many are now wondering exactly how Clinton managed to stand on her own and what it took for her to do so. While Clinton has admitted to having pneumonia, this doesn’t erase her history of withholding critical health information from the public. She claimed she didn’t think it was important to disclose her diagnosis, but with the media constantly scrutinizing her health, it’s clear that her condition has become a major concern — one she can no longer ignore. Clinton’s incident on September 11 was widely seen, including by international leaders who may now view her health as a vulnerability.

"Hillary Clinton was widely reported as the victor of last night’s debate by major news outlets, but social media sentiment told a different story. The #TrumpWon hashtag quickly gained traction online and eventually became the top trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter. “The #TrumpWon trend is now number one — thanks everyone!” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), September 27, 2016. What’s surprising isn’t just that it trended, but where it started — a revelation that may shock many: According to Trendsmap.com, the #TrumpWon hashtag first appeared in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the same city where President Vladimir Putin is believed to maintain a large network of state-sponsored online operatives. These individuals, often referred to as cyber-trolls, are part of a broader disinformation strategy known as *dezinformatsiya*, aimed at sowing confusion and deepening divisions among Western nations. Russian state media has previously been caught promoting pro-Trump content across American platforms, while simultaneously portraying him favorably to European audiences. Analysts suggest that Putin's goal is to influence the election in favor of Trump, someone he believes could ease the economic pressure on Russian elites and allow Moscow greater freedom in its foreign policy, particularly in Eastern Europe. Former participants in these operations have described their work environment as highly controlled and stressful, with strict quotas and heavy penalties for noncompliance. Trolls worked in cramped offices under constant supervision, with managers reviewing every post for ideological consistency. So next time you see a viral hashtag or read an aggressive comment, remember: it could be coming from a low-wage worker in a dimly lit room, simply trying to make ends meet.",1
"The government’s response to every failed initiative or underperforming agency is simply to pour more taxpayer funds into it. Since public education became the standard, students have become increasingly uninformed and unprepared. Yet, proponents of big government argue that the issue is always a lack of funding. So, they keep throwing money at the problem, and the issues only worsen. When the War on Drugs was launched, over $1.5 trillion was spent, yet drug use has remained steady or even increased. Rather than rethinking the strategy or addressing constitutional concerns, officials continue to fund the same approach, hoping for a different outcome. The same pattern repeats with the ""War on Terror."" The U.S. has invested nearly $5 trillion in counterterrorism efforts, yet global terrorism has surged. Instead of examining our foreign policy, especially in the Middle East, lawmakers just expand military operations and increase funding. Terrorism keeps growing. According to a report by Dr. Neta Crawford from Brown University, spending on defense, state, homeland security, and veterans since 9/11 has reached almost $5 trillion. Before we question how a country with over $19.3 trillion in debt can afford such massive war spending, the real question is: What has this money actually accomplished? As Reader Supported News noted last year, terrorism has risen by 6,500% since 2002—perhaps it should be called the “War of Terror.” In 2014, it was reported that 74% of terror-related deaths occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As Paul Gottinger from Reader Supported News pointed out, only Nigeria didn’t face U.S. air strikes or military presence that year. However, the U.S. has long been involved in Nigerian affairs. Why wouldn’t they? Nigeria used to be Africa’s top oil producer and largest economy until recently. Ben Swann highlights a shocking fact: “Before the 2003 invasion, there were zero suicide attacks in Iraq. None in the country’s history. But since then, there have been 1,892.” Before the war, over 1.5 million Christians lived in Iraq. Afterward, more than a million fled to Syria. Today, fewer than 500,000 remain, many now targeted by groups like ISIS. As terrorism threatens national security, the government keeps passing new laws that chip away at our",1
"An allegedly unarmed, mentally disabled white man experiencing a medical episode was shot by police on Monday afternoon. The incident occurred shortly after his brother called 911 for emergency help. Police in Riverside, California — near Los Angeles — tweeted that officers encountered a ""disturbed individual"" that resulted in an officer-involved shooting. The victim, later identified as Marcus Thompson, was reportedly 28 years old. Activist and community organizer Lisa Nguyen shared on Twitter that Thompson had succumbed to his injuries. Officers responded to a disturbed individual that ended with an officer involved shooting. We will share more details as they become available. — Riverside Police (@RiversidePD) October 5, 2017  

A source close to the family confirmed there was a fatal police shooting in Riverside. The victim’s name is Marcus Thompson. I’m at the scene and saw the aftermath. — Lisa Nguyen (@LisaNguyen123) October 6, 2017  

In a live stream on Facebook, journalist Jordan Lee interviewed Thompson’s brother, who said his sibling was having a severe panic attack and had not been armed. The brother claimed he called for medical assistance, but police arrived and shot Thompson within minutes. “I just wanted help, not for them to kill him,” the brother cried. “I should have called for mental health support instead of the police.”  

During a live report from the scene, local news anchor Rachel Kim captured statements from two witnesses who said Thompson was shot while holding his hands up. “I saw a man surrounded by officers, arms raised, and then they just started shooting,” one witness said, mimicking the position. “He wasn’t moving, just standing there. They fired multiple times.” Watch the full clip: #Periscope https://t.co/xyz123abc — Rachel Kim (@RachelKimNBC) October 5, 2017  

According to KABC, police took cell phones from several bystanders at a nearby café and instructed them not to share any footage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Riverside released a statement condemning the seizure. “Taking people's phones without a warrant or legal justification violates both the Fourth and First Amendments,” said ACLU attorney Michael Torres. “There is no justification for this kind of interference.” However, the police department denied the claims, stating that no phones were taken. We urge the public to avoid spreading false information. No phones were confiscated at the scene. —",1
"The latest early polls from last night’s debate are now released, showing a clear advantage for Hillary Clinton, who displayed composure, confidence, and expertise in contrast to Donald Trump, whose frequent interruptions and unclear statements left many viewers unimpressed. According to a breakdown by VOX, the results are striking: A poll of debate viewers conducted by CNN/ORC found that 64 percent believed Clinton emerged victorious, while 26 percent favored Trump. Although CNN's David Chalian noted that the sample leaned 12 points more Democratic than usual, the margin still reflects a strong performance for Clinton. Another survey by Public Policy Polling showed 53 percent thought Clinton won, compared to 39 percent for Trump. In a separate focus group of 25 undecided voters in Nevada, 21 said Clinton had the upper hand. Meanwhile, a GOP-affiliated poll by Frank Luntz found that Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly felt Clinton won. Libby Nelson provides further insight here. This decisive lead is significant, as nearly half of likely voters have stated that the debates will influence their choice. It appears that substance, experience, and credibility continue to resonate with the electorate, and last night’s debate reinforced that Clinton has those qualities in abundance.",1
"Kathy Miller, the campaign chair for Trump in Butler County, Pennsylvania—a key battleground in the state—made one of the most outlandish remarks of the election season. She claimed that racial discrimination only began after the election of President Obama. This statement, which is not only factually incorrect but also deeply offensive, has sparked widespread outrage. In an interview with a local news outlet, Miller stated, “I don’t think there was any racism before Obama was elected. We didn’t have these issues back then.” It’s hard to believe someone could genuinely think that, but apparently, she does. 

She went on to make further damaging comments about the Black community, suggesting that if Black people haven’t succeeded in the last 50 years, it’s entirely their own fault. “You had the same schools, you had benefits that white kids didn’t have, and you still didn’t take advantage,” she said. Such remarks ignore the long history of systemic inequality, from slavery to Jim Crow, and the ongoing challenges faced by Black Americans today.

Racism didn’t start with Obama—it’s been embedded in our country’s foundations for centuries. Black people have dealt with segregation, discriminatory laws, and unequal access to education and opportunity. The criminal justice system continues to disproportionately target Black communities, and schools in Black neighborhoods are often underfunded and overcrowded. The economic disadvantages faced by Black families are not new—they’re the result of generations of oppression.

It’s alarming that someone in a major political campaign can so openly dismiss these realities. Her comments reflect a dangerous ignorance that undermines the very principles of fairness and equality we should be striving for. Fortunately, Miller faced significant backlash and eventually stepped down from her position. But the fact that such views are still being voiced in a presidential campaign is deeply troubling.",1
"Bill Clinton has a number of former lovers, some of whom have spoken out about their experiences with him, but one in particular is making waves. According to the latest claims, a woman named Linda Hart, previously unknown to most, is accusing Hillary Clinton of having sudden and unexplained health issues. Hart, author of *Hillary: The Hidden Truth*, claims she had a close relationship with the former president and witnessed firsthand the tension between him and his wife. She recounts an incident during Bill Clinton’s time as governor of Arkansas where Hillary reportedly lost her temper in front of a group of disabled children.  

Hart suggests that Hillary’s health problems could be tied to her emotional state, saying, “She’s always been a very angry person, and people who carry that kind of rage often end up paying a price physically.” She adds that while anger may play a role, there’s also something more going on. “It’s not just anger—there’s a lot of stress, a lot of control issues,” she explains. “She’s always been like that, and I think it’s taking a toll.”  

Hart also claims Hillary has a habit of erasing information that doesn’t serve her interests, calling her “Hillary Scissors” for her tendency to destroy documents. If you haven’t read her book yet, she says it’s a chilling insight into the personality of a woman who could soon be in the White House. With so many others, including ex-employees and officials, sharing similar stories, it’s hard to ignore the possibility that there’s more to the tale than meets the eye.

"I’ve decided to stop supporting the NFL. There are some amazing athletes and coaches in the league, but until Commissioner Goodell takes a stand against disrespecting the National Anthem, the military, and law enforcement, I won’t be watching or endorsing them. If you truly love your country, you should love it more than any sport — what these entitled, wealthy players are doing is not only un-American, it's divisive and dangerous. They’re fueling a racial divide. Three Philadelphia Eagles players raised their fists in a Black Power salute during the National Anthem at a game in Chicago on Monday night. That’s unacceptable, and I’m done tolerating this behavior. Since Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the National Anthem, it’s only gotten worse. Now it’s spreading to colleges, high schools, and other sports. This has to stop. It doesn’t help that the Obamas have also participated in similar gestures — it’s a radical, inflammatory act that should not be allowed. I wouldn’t accept it any more than I would a Nazi salute. Even Sports Illustrated has taken sides with Black Lives Matter. From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world. Last week, NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now they're raising the Black Power fist. On Monday, four Eagles players raised their fists during the National Anthem. Malcolm Jenkins and a few teammates were seen with their hands in the air. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/lLW8ZoYUUn — John Clark CSN (@JClarkCSN) September 20, 2016. Eagles defensive end Steven Means, strong safety Malcolm Jenkins, and defensive back Ron Brooks all raised their fists. The rest of the Eagles and all the Bears players stood in silence. These players should face serious consequences for this kind of behavior. Especially since just days ago, a black man attacked a female police officer in Philadelphia, shooting her eight times. Her vest saved her, but he killed one person and injured five others before being arrested. This gesture only adds to the growing tension between communities and law enforcement. These athletes live in the most free country in the world, earning millions while complaining about the system that supports them. They’re rejecting the very people who protect them. Obama has turned a colorblind society into a breeding ground for racial conflict. Now we have groups like Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers, and the Nation of Islam inciting division and violence. These players deserve more than",1
"Obama has always been aware that some of the unvetted refugees he’s bringing into the country are linked to terrorist groups. That was never in question. He just doesn’t care. When he first announced his plan to accept 10,000 refugees, I thought it was ridiculous. I told people he was really aiming for 250,000 and they laughed at me. Now he says 110,000 and I’m telling you, it’ll be way more than that, and many will be connected to ISIS. Obama isn’t just transforming America into a Muslim country—he’s intentionally introducing violence and instability to weaken us. Just like with the race riots he’s encouraged. This has been his plan all along. Now they’re finally admitting they know it, but they’re still pushing forward. They have no intention of slowing down, let alone stopping the flow. This is one area where I agree with Donald Trump—this has to be stopped until we can properly screen these individuals. Obama now knows Hillary might lose, so he’s doubling down on this strategy, and more bloodshed is coming. From the Daily Caller: Islamic State terrorists have attempted to pose as refugees to get into the U.S., admitted Department of State spokesperson John Kirby on Wednesday. “I won’t argue that there's a risk of ISIS trying to infiltrate,” Kirby said on Fox News. “We’ve seen it happen in refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey, where they try to blend in.” He was defending President Barack Obama’s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees next year, a sharp increase from the usual 70,000, claiming the vetting process is “solid.” Any reasonable leader, after seeing multiple terrorist attacks traced back to refugees, would rethink their approach. But not Obama. We were hit by at least three terror incidents last week, and he went to the UN to push even harder for more refugees. Obama despises America and is a traitor to this nation. Every move he’s made in office screams that he’s an enemy within. Yet, we’re doing nothing to stop him. Terrorism and American lives lost are the result of our inaction. Obama and his team know this will lead to more attacks. We know it too. Why are we just standing by? Has America lost its courage to protect itself?",1
"This is truly heartbreaking. Extremist groups are exploiting young children for deadly missions. A video captured by the Syrian news outlet Al-Marsad shows a child being forced into a suicide bombing operation, and it has spread rapidly online. At 1 minute and 42 seconds into the clip, you can clearly see the child’s terrified expression, filled with fear and confusion. According to reports from the Kurdish media outlet Rozhnama, ISIS has established a training facility in Raqqa called ""The Young Lions,"" where children as young as 8 are indoctrinated with extremist ideology, taught how to carry out attacks, and given combat lessons. The brutal organization is determined to expand its influence worldwide, and using children in warfare is becoming increasingly common. In the last six months, ISIS has reportedly trained over 800 children for suicide missions. It's unimaginable to think about the methods used to turn a child into a weapon. How do they convince a child to wear a bomb and walk into a crowd? Let that sink in… a religion of peace, indeed. Just last month, a child suicide bomber attacked a celebration in Istanbul, killing dozens and injuring many more. The boy in the footage below was detained by Syrian authorities after acting strangely. This video shows the security forces removing the explosive device from his body. Anyone who exploits children in this way deserves nothing but condemnation. It's shocking that some religious leaders don't speak out against this. This disturbing trend is now appearing in Western countries, where reports suggest men are committing violent acts against children as young as five, claiming it's part of their culture. It’s no surprise that these same individuals would use children to carry out their violent agenda.",1
"Hillary Clinton claims that Christians are prejudiced and unacceptable. In her view, they use ""religious liberty"" as a cover for discrimination. You know how liberals criticize generalizing about groups? That doesn’t stop them from targeting conservatives and Christians. Oh, and they’re also anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim. Wow. Read more below! As Written By Ken Klukowski for Breitbart: Hillary Clinton: Christians Are Prejudiced and Unacceptable, 'Religious Liberty' as a Mask for Discrimination. Christians across the country should be alarmed by Hillary Clinton’s labeling of Trump supporters as “prejudiced” individuals who are so “unacceptable” they are “irredeemable,” since she was largely referring to people of faith, as shown by one of her top Democratic allies just days before her controversial speech. While many were shocked by Clinton’s remarks, few have focused on the setting and background. Clinton delivered the speech in New York City at an LGBTQ+ gathering. She specifically mentioned that the “prejudiced” and “irredeemable” people she criticized are both anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim. Observant Christians in 2016 are frequently accused of being prejudiced and anti-LGBT for adhering to biblical teachings that define marriage as between a man and a woman, sexuality as only appropriate within marriage, and gender as a divine creation to be embraced. These progressives also claim that such Christians are anti-woman because they believe in protecting the life of the unborn, which they call “discrimination.” Clinton’s accusation of anti-Muslim sentiment was broadly directed at Americans who express concerns about certain interpretations of Islam—those that promote violence and extremism—without addressing the broader Muslim community.

"The unrest in Raleigh has brought the city to a standstill. Stores were ransacked, buildings set on fire, and public spaces turned into battlegrounds. What began as peaceful demonstrations have spiraled into chaos, with rioters engaging in violence, theft, and even fatal attacks. Governor Roy Cooper has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to restore order. Now, authorities are taking an even tougher stance. They’ve just announced a sweeping new policy that will hit protestors hard — anyone caught participating in riots, looting, or any form of unlawful destruction will lose their government assistance for good.  

This isn’t just about the adults. Any minors involved in the violence will also face the same penalties, and their parents could be held responsible as well. Parents of minors who take part in the unrest may lose their benefits, be referred to child protection services, and could even risk losing custody of their children. “Parents must be accountable for their kids’ actions,” said local official Maria Delgado at a press briefing. “If your child is out causing damage or engaging in violent behavior, you’ll share in the consequences.”  

Many of those arrested are teenagers from local high schools. Officials are urging parents to monitor their children closely and enforce the new curfew. “This is a serious situation,” Delgado added. “If your child is involved in this, it’s time to step up as a parent.”  

Will this new rule stop the violence? Will it prevent opportunists from using tragedy as a cover for lawlessness? It's unclear, but one thing is certain — the message is clear now. Parents may finally start taking their responsibilities more seriously, and protesters will think twice before breaking the law. The city is working to bring calm back, but for now, the streets remain tense.",1
"UPDATE: The story just keeps unfolding. Keith Lamont Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, claimed the man was reading…a religious text…before he was shot. You can’t make this up! Why hasn’t the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief, Kerr Putney, released the footage of the encounter with Keith Lamont Scott? According to the chief, it’s clear that Scott had a weapon. But then he quickly changed his stance, saying, “The video does not provide me with absolute, definitive visual evidence that someone was holding a gun.” So what does that really mean? From his statement, there’s only one logical conclusion – that Scott was indeed in possession of a handgun. Other evidence and witness reports back up the police account that officers fired only after Scott refused to drop his weapon. He was holding it, not a book, as some “witnesses and family members” have suggested. Therefore, since the weapon was in his hand, Scott likely intended to use it. However, progressive media outlets like the Huffington Post have taken a different spin on Putney’s comments, claiming, “He [Putney] did note that the video doesn’t confirm Scott was holding a gun when he was shot.” That’s not what the chief said. Putney clearly chose his words with care. We don’t know why – but we do know he did. Watching the press conference video provides more clarity to his remarks. As he explains that there is “no definitive proof” that “a person” was pointing a gun, he uses his hand to… Read the full story at www.iPatriot.com.

"Through the course of this election cycle, a persistent question has loomed over Trump’s campaign – not just one, but many. A cloud of confusion, secrecy, and controversy. But the main issue being discussed is “why hasn’t Trump released his tax returns?” The answer, as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that he has not paid federal income taxes for years. Trump criticized Clinton for mismanaging public funds, claiming it has hurt vital infrastructure projects — a stance that contradicts the Republican platform he usually supports. Clinton seized the moment to push back, saying, “Maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax in a long time.” She set the trap, and Trump walked right into it. In an attempt to defend himself, he accidentally confirmed her claim: “It would be squandered too, believe me.” Note the word “would.” If Trump had actually paid taxes, he wouldn’t have used that phrasing. Earlier in the debate, he called paying taxes “smart,” yet now he’s avoiding disclosure. Is this why he’s resisting releasing his returns, claiming he’ll do so “against his lawyer’s advice” if Clinton releases her emails? Could it be that Trump is hiding the fact that he’s avoided his tax responsibilities? When Trump says “believe me,” take it with a grain of salt — not because his taxes would be “squandered,” but because he believes they “would” if he had paid them.

"A top Trump ally in Silicon Valley is now facing a major federal investigation over alleged racial bias in hiring, as the U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against the tech firm One Medical, which is owned by Republican donor and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman. The lawsuit claims that the company, based in San Francisco, engaged in discriminatory practices against Asian applicants during its hiring process. One Medical, which provides healthcare services to federal employees, is also a contractor for several government agencies. Sources suggest that Trump is considering a high-profile judicial appointment for Hoffman, who has openly criticized free speech protections, antitrust regulations, and democratic institutions. Both Hoffman and the Trump campaign have denied the allegations. According to the lawsuit, out of 150 engineering interns hired, 70% were Asian, yet only 12 Asians were selected compared to 38 non-Asians. “The probability of this outcome occurring by chance is less than one in a million,” the filing states. Interestingly, Hoffman, who was once considered an unlikely Trump supporter, is himself the son of immigrants who came to the U.S. for better opportunities. Now, he's backing a candidate who has taken strong anti-immigration stances. Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and early investor in Facebook, gained broader public attention after revealing his involvement in funding a legal battle that led to the collapse of the website Jezebel, in retaliation for exposing his personal life. Recently, he made headlines at the Republican National Convention by openly identifying as gay, criticizing the party’s focus on bathroom policies and declaring, “Every American has a right to their identity. I’m proud to be gay and proud to be a Republican.” His speech, which received mixed reactions from the audience, came amid a GOP platform that included some of the most restrictive policies toward LGBTQ+ rights in recent history. “Federal contractors must uphold the principle of equal opportunity,” said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Taxpayers deserve transparency and fairness in how companies with public contracts treat job applicants.” A spokesperson for One Medical stated the company will “fight the accusations” and denies any wrongdoing. Now, the executive who once criticized government inefficiency will have to defend his company’s practices in court, despite the troubling data presented in the lawsuit.",1

"Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, has remained consistent in her assertion that she turned over all of her official emails. Despite wiping her computer using advanced digital erasure methods, not just a regular wipe, she claims there's nothing to conceal. The twist is that even as fresh batches of emails have come to light, she continues to stand by her original statement. Recently, 30 emails resurfaced from her deleted server—emails that weren’t part of the so-called “complete” set she initially provided. These newly found messages were linked to the Benghazi incident, raising questions about what she knew at the time.  

FBI investigators uncovered the 30 emails from Clinton’s wiped server, which discussed the Benghazi attack, according to government attorneys during a court hearing on Tuesday. The disclosure came in a case involving Judicial Watch, a watchdog group, before U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta. The government stated that some of the recovered emails contained search terms connected to Benghazi.  

Clinton had submitted over 30,000 of her work emails to the State Department in December 2014. Of those, only 296 were released related to Benghazi and Libya, with the agency claiming they were the full set. However, in September, an additional 925 Benghazi-related emails were discovered and handed to the House Select Committee on Benghazi. It was also revealed last month that Clinton had deleted thousands of work-related emails from her server.  

Is it really taking a full day to process each recovered email? There must be something significant in there… Intriguing.",1
"They don’t call Fox News the Trump Channel for no reason. They’re there to back the president at all costs and block any uncomfortable truths from seeing the light of day. During a heated debate on the network, host Sean Hannity clashed with former Trump advisor Jason Miller over the administration’s handling of the Russia investigation. Hannity argued that the president should address the controversy just as Obama dealt with the Fast and Furious scandal. “With Obama, he had to face the fallout from that mess,” Hannity said. “It was a disaster. Everyone around him knew it was a mess, and he didn’t handle it well. It wasn’t enough. Why?” Miller countered that it wasn’t the same situation. “And Obama — there’s no comparison. Obama broke the law. He violated federal guidelines.” They kept going: Hannity: He didn’t break the law. Miller: Yes, he did. Hannity: James Clapper lied too? Miller: He said there was no evidence of wrongdoing. He admitted it was a bad decision, but said there wasn’t enough to take legal action. And he said that, too. Hannity: No, he didn’t. He said there was no legal basis for any charges. He made that clear in his report. He said it wasn’t even close. Never mind the fact that the Attorney General at the time called it “a serious breach of protocol” and that the White House had multiple classified documents stored on personal devices. Isn’t that exactly what Obama did? Clapper himself said the administration was “extremely careless” — meaning grossly negligent — in how they handled sensitive information. And everyone knows that they used several unsecured devices along with a private server, which contained classified material.

"In an exclusive interview with a Cleveland, Ohio TV outlet, Donald Trump unintentionally revealed that his earlier 20-second statement affirming Barack Obama's U.S. birthplace was nothing more than a calculated move. Speaking to WOIO, Trump appeared to revive the birther narrative in a subtle, backhanded way. When asked by reporter Mike Thompson, “Why did you suddenly say this week that you believe President Obama was born in the U.S., after years of questioning it?” Trump responded that he simply wanted to shift focus from the issue, saying, “I just wanted to move on with the campaign. People were tired of hearing about it. We need to talk about the economy, about jobs, about the border, and about making America great again.”  

Yes, the ability to avoid scrutiny over the eight years he relentlessly pushed for Obama’s birth certificate, college records, and other documents—claiming that the president, known in some circles as Barry Soetoro, was actually a Kenyan-born fraud who somehow became president through sheer trickery. Ironically, this slip-up that his stance on the matter had never truly changed may be one of the most truthful things Trump has said recently, as he continues to face criticism over the Trump Foundation’s use of donations for personal legal expenses, attacks on minority communities, and his controversial remarks about recent terror incidents in the U.S. Watch the full exchange below:",1

Thompson says he asked one of the officers why they had deployed in full gear, and the officer simply replied, “It’s necessary.” Five minutes later, a protestor collapsed in a pool of blood. “It wasn’t just a loud bang,” he said. “It was like a explosion. People screamed, ‘They shot him!’ and ran in every direction.”  

According to Thompson, the police then began issuing orders to disperse, and tear gas was fired into the crowd from both sides. It took him over ten minutes to get out of the area, and",1
"After a long day of spreading division and fear among ordinary Americans, it’s said that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump unwinds in his luxury bed by reading works from his favorite author – Adolf Hitler. Before Trump became a household name with his rhetoric of hatred, bigotry, and scapegoating, he was reportedly immersed in the writings of the man responsible for the second-most mass murders in history. A 1987 article in *The New York Times* by David Halberstam revealed that Trump’s first wife, Ivana, once mentioned to her attorney, Robert Altman, that Trump occasionally read Hitler’s speeches, specifically *My New Order*, which he kept on a shelf next to his bed. Altman reportedly stored a copy in his office drawer, as if it were a dangerous weapon. Hitler’s speeches, spanning from his early years to the outbreak of World War II, showcase his talent for manipulation and propaganda. When confronted about the book, Trump initially denied it, claiming he had never seen it. The reporter asked, “Did your uncle give you the Hitler speeches?” Trump appeared stunned and tried to change the subject by asking, “Who told you that?” but then admitted he owned the book, saying, “Actually, it was my friend Steve Cohen from CBS who gave me a copy of *Mein Kampf*, and he's Jewish.” It’s alarming enough that Trump admitted to owning the book, but his reasoning reveals a twisted logic. He argued that it’s fine to read about Hitler’s anti-Semitic views because a Jewish friend gave it to him, and wouldn’t it be disrespectful to throw it away without reading it? Trump lied about lying, as usual. Steve Cohen later confirmed giving the book, but it was actually *My Jewish Order*, not *Mein Kampf*. Whether that makes it any better is debatable. Cohen also claimed he isn’t Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends. After realizing the implication of his comment, Trump quickly backtracked, insisting, “If I had those speeches, and I’m not saying I do, I would never read them.” But he just admitted he had them! While it’s hard to imagine Trump in bed, it’s easy to picture him surrounded by Nazi symbols, absorbing tactics to deceive and intimidate the public. Trump’s campaign has mirrored Hitler’s methods of vilifying minorities and blaming them for national problems, making it crucial to stop him from becoming president in less than seven weeks.

"Last night, the American public finally witnessed a rare moment: Joe Biden and Donald Trump sharing the same stage. And as expected, there was plenty of tension. By the end of the evening, it was clear who came out on top — Joe Biden. No one should be surprised. While the media had been hinting at a ""Biden pivot,"" the reality was the same as always — what we saw was the same Trump we've come to expect: loud, unprepared, and full of empty promises. The experts know it. The polls know it. The people know it. Biden won because he was focused, composed, and ready to lead. But, as usual, Trump and his team refused to accept the truth. They claim the moderator was biased. They say the timing was unfair. They say Biden was ""too prepared"" and that it wasn’t a fair fight. More excuses from a candidate who refuses to take responsibility for his performance. He was unprepared, disrespectful, and failed to address key issues — instead, he attacked and lied. But let's focus on why Biden clearly dominated. His best moment came when he said, “I’ve spent my whole life preparing for this moment, not just for this debate, but for this country.” It’s reported that Biden immersed himself in policy, studied every detail, and practiced relentlessly. Trump, on the other hand, seemed disinterested, often drifting off-topic and failing to back up his claims with facts. He didn’t engage constructively, and he didn’t listen. Fortunately, Biden stayed calm and focused, even when Trump rambled endlessly. He didn’t get drawn into personal attacks, and he corrected Trump when necessary. He wasn’t “too aggressive,” as some claimed, but he stood his ground when needed. And, despite the criticism, he maintained a professional demeanor. One of the main frustrations with political debates is that moderators often let candidates dominate the conversation, allowing interruptions and time violations. This time, however, Biden showed restraint. He respected the moderator’s time and rarely interrupted Trump. In contrast, Trump interrupted Biden 42 times, while Biden only interrupted Trump 15 times. At the end, Biden shook the moderator’s hand, while Trump did not. Even though Trump’s “Sleepy Joe” taunts were trending on social media, fact checks revealed that Trump made far more false statements than Biden. According to a non-partisan analysis, Biden’s claims were largely accurate, while",1

"A man in a security uniform entered a shopping center in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday evening. He began shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" before stabbing six people. The attacker reportedly asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before attacking them. The suspect has been identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim. Members of the local Somali-American community confirmed Adan's identity as the perpetrator, according to the SC Times. On Sunday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, stating Adan was one of their operatives. This incident followed a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps event in New Jersey, a knife attack on NYPD officers in New York, and a blast in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 people. 

Local Somali leaders issued a statement expressing sympathy for Adan’s family, calling him “a good student” and “well-respected” in the community. St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis told reporters that Adan was killed by an off-duty police officer named Jason Falconer, who intervened during the attack. Kleis praised Falconer as a hero who ""was in the right place at the right time."" Falconer identified himself as an officer, prompting Adan to attack him. Falconer then shot and killed Adan, sending him to ""his reward in heaven,"" which some have jokingly referred to as a place with ""72 virgins — or maybe pigs.""

Last year, the Washington Times reported that over 10,000 Somali refugees were resettled in Minnesota under the Obama administration. U.S. officials have warned that groups like ISIS and al-Shabab are actively recruiting from Somali communities. In recent months, reports have surfaced about threats against women in Minnesota by some Somali residents. Additionally, ISIS has been gaining strength in Somalia, with intelligence sources indicating support from Yemen-based affiliates.

In June, three Somalians in Minnesota were convicted of attempting to join ISIS. In July, al-Shabab reportedly reached out to ISIS to coordinate attacks on American soil. Department of Homeland Security records show that over 31,000 Somali refugees were brought into the U.S. during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. 

Breitbart News claimed that a Clinton presidency would lead to a dramatic increase in Muslim refugee admissions, potentially exceeding 1 million in her first term. It is clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted by extremist groups. The attack in Minnesota shows the danger these individuals can pose.",1
"In a time when government and media continue to grow in influence, a patriotic American has uncovered something that the Department of Justice and major news outlets have failed (or refused) to reveal: Evidence suggesting that Hillary Clinton was involved in covering up her improper use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. A Twitter user known as @ConservativeAnalyst has compiled compelling information that has now been shared with the House Oversight Committee, prompting a fresh probe into the matter. Paul Combetta, who served as Hillary Clinton’s IT consultant during her time in the State Department, is alleged to have sought guidance on how to erase her name from classified emails. He reportedly reached out to the public through the online forum Reddit under the username “stonetear” during the summer and fall of 2014, leaving behind a trail of clues. In one of his posts, Combetta asked for help with removing the email address of an “Important Client” from both active and archived email systems. “Hi everyone,” one post reads. “I’m dealing with a situation where I need to remove an important client’s email from a bunch of old messages stored in an Exchange mailbox and a PST file. They don’t want the client’s address exposed. Does anyone know how to do this or have any tips?” The House Oversight Committee has requested that Reddit preserve all related content, and the investigation is now underway. Whether this leads to any significant conclusions remains uncertain, but what is clear is that an ordinary citizen has uncovered information that mainstream media and officials have ignored. The key question now is whether the username “stonetear” can be definitively linked to Paul Combetta. If not, the evidence may be considered circumstantial. If it can, it would provide direct proof of a deliberate attempt to hide sensitive information. @ConservativeAnalyst has presented several connections to support the claim that “stonetear” is indeed Combetta. This story has not gained much attention, as traditional media has little interest in highlighting a regular citizen's efforts. However, as more people become aware and the evidence is formally submitted to the committee, the role of everyday Americans as investigators and truth-seekers will continue to grow.

"There is a significant segment of the American public who believe the Black Lives Matter movement is not genuinely focused on protecting black lives, but rather using the cause as a cover to incite unrest and destruction. Matt Walsh of TheBlaze isn’t holding back when he calls the group “terrorists.” He lays out his reasoning with conviction, arguing that if you support the cause but disagree with the methods, this might be the most crucial opinion piece you read today. He begins by examining the recent turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina. If you're confused about what happened there, here's the breakdown: a black officer shot a black man who was armed, leading a group of black activists to set fire to a black neighborhood and loot black-owned stores in an effort to protest racial injustice. It sounds oversimplified, but Walsh is right on point. He continues: No, it still doesn’t make sense. There are plenty of questions that arise. For instance, why do they claim the victim was unarmed when the evidence shows he had a gun? And regardless of whether the shooting was justified, why are they chanting “white cops are evil” when the officer involved was black? Even if the officer were white—and that seems unlikely theologically—why would they destroy their own community in response? And the biggest question of all: Why do we still call this violent chaos and crime “a protest”? It’s almost too convenient that every Black Lives Matter “protest” ends in destruction. I almost said it “descends into” violence, but that’s not quite accurate. After seeing these events unfold across the country for years, it’s clear that chaos and destruction are the goal, not just side effects. The media insists—just like they have before—that the Charlotte protests “started peacefully” and then turned violent. But that’s like saying a drive-by shooting “began as a calm ride through the city” until the shooters started firing. That may be technically true, but the intent was always toward violence, just as these “protests” seem to be planned from the start to lead to destruction and looting. These riots aren’t exceptions—they’re the norm. They’re expected, intentional, and increasingly severe. Read the full piece here. It’s definitely worth your time.",1
"The first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump was marked by intense back-and-forth between the two leaders, along with a few controversial moments. CBS’s Bob Schieffer, the moderator of the event, faced criticism during the debate after repeatedly cutting off Trump to ""correct"" him, though many of his corrections were later proven inaccurate. In one of the most heated exchanges, Schieffer claimed that Trump had supported the Afghanistan War from the start, but Trump denied it, according to The Daily Briefing. Instead of questioning Biden about his role in supporting the war, Schieffer kept focusing on Trump, citing a past interview where Trump allegedly expressed confidence in the mission. After the debate, the interview was released, revealing that Trump had actually voiced doubts about the war before it began. “You know, what happened to the days of Eisenhower? He would make a decision and go with it,” Trump said. “He didn’t waste time talking. We need to either do it or not do it.” “Well, he (Obama) either needed to act or not act,” Trump added, showing hesitation about the military involvement. You can watch the clip here: Rather than hold Trump accountable for his past statements, the moderator should have focused on Biden, who had more access to intelligence and information at the time. It's no surprise that the media turned what could have been a meaningful discussion into an opportunity to undermine Trump. Fortunately, Trump remained composed and challenged both Biden and the press throughout the night. Share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know your thoughts on the debate.

"Obama’s presidency is coming to a close, and millions of Americans are eagerly awaiting the day he leaves the White House. He once promised to transform America for the better, but instead, his policies have led to widespread disappointment. It’s unlikely that his legacy will be viewed positively once he’s gone, as many believe his administration has left the country in a worse state than before. Yet, Obama continues to promote his record, urging citizens to defend his legacy after he’s no longer in office.  

During a recent address to the Congressional Black Caucus, Obama referenced the Jim Crow era and slavery to push voters toward supporting the ""right"" candidate. He emphasized that his legacy was at stake and encouraged the audience to help ensure a strong farewell by getting people to the polls. While he didn’t name Hillary Clinton directly, he strongly implied that the black community should support her, stating, “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is. And there is one candidate who will continue that work, and another who stands in its way.”  

He also highlighted the high voter turnout among African Americans in 2008 and 2012, warning, “If this community doesn’t come out and vote, it will be a personal blow to me and my legacy. You want to honor me? Then go vote!”  

However, the facts challenge everything Obama claims. The Democratic Party historically supported slavery and segregation, while the Republican Party was founded to end those very systems. The first African American members of Congress were Republicans, and it was Democrats who created the Ku Klux Klan to suppress black voting rights.  

Meanwhile, Obama’s record with the black community is questionable. His administration ended school choice programs in Washington, D.C., limiting opportunities for low-income students. Unemployment and reliance on food assistance have risen, disproportionately affecting black communities. He has done little to address the breakdown of the black family, the high rate of abortions among black women, or the alarming number of children born outside of marriage.  

How can he speak so confidently about his legacy when the evidence suggests otherwise? It seems he's lost touch with reality.",1

"“Instead of ending harmful, politically-motivated policies that have resulted in 78,000 removable criminal immigrants being released back into communities over the past three years, ICE attempted to conceal the truth by supplying misleading data to Congress and the public,” said Maria Lopez, spokesperson for the Center for Immigration Accountability. In a recent report from the Center for Immigration Accountability (CIA), it is claimed that the Trump administration “grossly underreported—by nearly eightfold”—the number of crimes committed by undocumented, convicted immigrants who were released from detention in fiscal year 2016. If the term ‘undocumented, criminal immigrants’ seems harsh, it’s because it reflects the legal status of individuals who are in the U.S. without authorization, making them subject to removal. The term ‘criminal’ refers to those who committed offenses while here and were incarcerated, but not deported. “In response to a request from the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017, ICE stated that the 28,345 criminal immigrants it released instead of deporting in FY 2016 had committed an additional 1,276 offenses,” the CIA’s statement read. “However, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of the CIA reveal that the actual number of subsequent convictions linked to these released immigrants was 11,832. It’s important to note that not all arrests lead to convictions, so the real number of crimes committed by these individuals is likely even higher.” “These criminals, who were responsible for the 11,832 convictions, were not considered dangerous enough for deportation under ICE’s stated priorities,” the report continued. “The list of offenses includes murder, robbery, sexual assault, drunk driving, and more. Despite knowing the risks their policies posed, ICE increased the number of deportable criminals released in 2017—over 18,000 in total.” “Over the last few years, the number of criminal immigrants being deported has dropped significantly, even though there are sufficient resources to remove many more. This is due to policies that prioritize protecting undocumented immigrants—including those with criminal records—over the safety of American citizens,” Lopez said. “Rather than end these dangerous, politically-driven practices that have put 78,000 removable criminal immigrants back on the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to cover it up by giving false information to",1
"It wouldn’t be too shocking if George H.W. Bush ended up supporting Hillary Clinton in the election. After all, his son Jeb struggled during the primary season, and the entire Bush family was noticeably absent from the Republican National Convention when Donald Trump was officially nominated. The Bushes have largely stayed out of the political spotlight this time around, offering no public comments on their preferred candidate. However, a close associate claims that the 92-year-old former president is planning to vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. This claim comes from Mary Richardson, a longtime friend of the Bush family and a former Maryland state senator. She recently shared a photo online of herself with George H.W. Bush at his summer home in Kennebunkport, captioning it: “He told me he’s voting for Hillary.” According to a report by The Daily Beast, Richardson was visiting Bush at Walker’s Point when she received the news. In a later interview, she confirmed, “That’s what he said.” When asked about the claim, a Bush spokesperson refused to comment, stating, “President Bush will cast his ballot privately in 50 days, and he has no further comments on the election at this time.” The Daily Beast also noted that several former Bush administration officials have already expressed support for Clinton over Trump, including national security advisor Richard Allen and former Treasury Secretary James Baker.",1
"As this strange political season moves toward its final days, the topic of racial tension in the U.S. has taken center stage. With recent incidents of black individuals being shot by police in St. Louis and Baltimore, the situation has escalated quickly. While progressive voices argue that deep-seated systemic racism still exists in law enforcement and judicial systems, conservative figures counter with historical references to figures like Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X to suggest otherwise. Liberals see these shootings as proof of ongoing injustice, while some on the right frame them as consequences for individuals who ""chose"" to defy authority. A common tactic among modern conservatives is to ignore the legal rights guaranteed to all citizens and instead focus on a person's past offenses. They often overlook how institutional bias can lead to higher arrest rates and harsher sentencing for Black Americans. In fact, they seem to know every minor infraction—like jaywalking or unpaid traffic tickets—committed by every Black person ever killed by police. Recently, while scrolling through a Twitter thread covering a CNN report about a Missouri officer facing charges for shooting a man with his hands up, I saw a tweet that clearly illustrated how racism continues to thrive in America: @CNN@blp3pic.twitter.com/6vXqKdF8h9 — Marcus (@VOTE_TRUMP_) August 15, 2016  
Once again, conservatives are quick to defend the officer by highlighting the victim’s past behavior. The issue is that the tweet in question was referencing a different case altogether—this time, it was the killing of Jamar Clark, not the officer involved in the incident being discussed. My reply was straightforward: @VOTE_TRUMP_ @CNN @blp3 Why does the criminal history of someone else matter? Oh…because “they” are all the same, right? — Jordan Thompson (@jordanthompson) August 15, 2016  
It’s not surprising that the man killed in St. Louis is being judged based on the record of another Black man from a different city. What’s more alarming is that no one corrected the error. My comment was spot on. To the racist conservative, it doesn’t matter that these were two separate people from different states who had never met. “They” are all the same. It's only fitting that the user’s handle is “@VOTE_TRUMP_,” because…of course it is.",1
"Hillary Clinton's ground presence in Ohio is minimal. The video below reveals what they discovered. The Clinton campaign is said to be strong, but the reality may be different. Hillary Clinton often highlights the size of her paid staff. Then there are the volunteers. Most people understand that Ohio is a key state in the election. Earlier reports indicated that Clinton had over 681 paid workers, while Trump had just 68. With those numbers, it seems the Clinton team has a clear advantage, right? However, despite Trump's efforts to strengthen his local outreach, Clinton has continued to expand her workforce. Current figures suggest the Clinton campaign now employs more than 1,000 paid staff. A Trump supporter reportedly went to check out a door-knocking effort and found an office with a few chairs set up for a meeting. Only one person was inside. After a short while, a woman emerged and introduced herself. Behind the counter were a handful of volunteers — that’s essentially the Clinton operation in this part of Ohio. When the Trump representative started talking about the truth of the situation, the response wasn’t very positive. If you can count your volunteers on one hand, you're in trouble. This likely explains the so-called ""enthusiasm gap"" that has frustrated liberal media outlets. It also sheds light on why Clinton struggles to gain momentum. Recent polls show Trump closing in or even leading. His fundraising numbers clearly reflect stronger support for Trump than for Clinton.",1
"I woke up this morning to see a version of this headline all over my social media: Here’s Facebook: Naturally, my first thought was, “Oh no, what did Barack Obama do now to mess up his wife’s campaign?” The headline sounds extremely damaging, playing right into the narrative that the Obama Foundation is corrupt, just like some critics have been claiming for years. Unfortunately, most people don’t look beyond the headlines, which is a shame because the real story is that there’s no evidence of corruption. “It was natural for people who were our allies and friends to reach out and ask for things,” Obama said in a recent interview with *The New York Times*. “And I believed the administration would handle those requests appropriately.” Source: *Fox News* In other words, people might have asked for favors, but that doesn’t mean they got them. Leaked documents show that some donors met with Obama, while others were denied. There's no proof of any quid pro quo. Now, let's talk about the foundation the media rarely brings up — the Biden Foundation. Biden hasn't contributed to his own foundation since 2010. Instead, he's taken money from others and used it under his name. He's also allegedly spent charity funds on personal items like luxury cars and designer clothes, all under the guise of philanthropy. The Pennsylvania Attorney General recently announced an investigation into the Biden Foundation, citing concerns about potential violations of state nonprofit laws. Reports suggest that Biden used charitable donations to purchase expensive items for himself, even though he hasn’t donated to the foundation in over a decade. Source: *Breitbart* Breitbart highlights the double standard in media coverage, pointing out how clearly the press is biased in favor of Trump at the expense of Biden. Recent studies show that news outlets covered Biden’s recent health scare nearly 10 times more than the ongoing investigations into the Biden Foundation. Meanwhile, stories about the foundation’s questionable spending have been largely ignored in favor of coverage about Trump’s latest political moves. This kind of one-sided reporting is helping Trump and hurting Biden. Trump has gained momentum lately, partly because the media focuses on every small issue with Biden — if you can call a routine medical checkup a “scandal” — while completely overlooking the many issues surrounding Trump’s own organizations.",1
"For years, corporations have been manipulating the American public by threatening to move their operations abroad if we don't support their preferred political agenda. Unfortunately, even when we do align with their interests, it often leads to worse outcomes. Wages stay low, jobs disappear, and regulations are ignored. It wasn’t until the most recent election cycle that a CEO openly revealed his intentions if his side (the Republican party) lost. Four years ago, Papa John’s founder John Schnatter warned he would cut employee hours and raise pizza prices if Obamacare passed. It did, and he didn’t. This year, another fast food executive is making headlines for vowing to harm the economy unless his demands are met. Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, has been vocal about his plans. Here's one of his ads, which might not be suitable for all audiences:  

From the ads, it's clear Puzder shares some of Trump’s disregard for political correctness. But his real motive isn’t about ideology—it’s about avoiding higher wages. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder claimed that if a Democrat wins, he will fully automate his restaurants. Speaking about an automated chain called Eatsa, he told Business Insider: “I want to try it. We could have a restaurant focused on all-natural products, similar to Eatsa, where you order at a kiosk, pay with a card, and your food comes up without ever seeing a person.”  

He argues that rising labor costs are pushing businesses to cut jobs. “You’ll see automation in airports, grocery stores, and even restaurants,” he says. “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton—raising the minimum wage doesn’t help if someone loses their job.”  

Source: Yahoo Finance  

This threat is more about his employees than the general public. Puzder employs around 20,000 people nationwide, and he’s trying to get them to vote against their own interests. He also runs a blog where he frequently writes about politics and the benefits of free-market capitalism. One can question whether his workers share his enthusiasm. Puzder himself is doing very well—he earned nearly $4.5 million in 2012. His profits have grown, but his employees aren’t sharing in the success. In fact, Puzder has a history of complaining whenever he’s prevented from exploiting his workforce. Even if a Republican wins",1
"The Senate on Monday failed to approve a short-term spending measure to keep the government running as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans refused to allow transparency in corporate political donations and blocked aid for the struggling residents of Flint, Michigan. Lawmakers have been negotiating a continuing resolution that would fund federal agencies until at least December 9. Without such an agreement, the government could face a shutdown in just three days on October 1. The main obstacle has been a provision pushed by McConnell that would prevent the SEC from mandating public disclosure of political spending by corporations. Since the 2010 Citizens United ruling, large donors and corporations have been free to pour unlimited funds into elections without revealing their sources, leading to over $700 million in undisclosed political spending this year alone. This has greatly benefited Republican candidates and their wealthy backers, so much so that Senate Republicans are willing to risk a government shutdown to protect the secrecy of their financial supporters. In addition, disputes have emerged over the exclusion of aid for Flint, Michigan, still reeling from a water crisis caused by policies linked to conservative governance. While the bill includes funding for flood victims in Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, Democrats have sought to add support for Flint’s residents. Republicans, however, have repeatedly refused, claiming the issue is local or should be handled separately through the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The problem is that Democrats previously included Flint aid in WRDA, only to see it removed by House Republicans led by Paul Ryan. With the House controlled by hardline conservatives, any attempt to restore the funding would likely fail. Once again, Republicans are putting partisan interests above the needs of the public, risking a government shutdown over issues that have nothing to do with national security or fiscal responsibility. This latest standoff highlights how many Republicans have abandoned their duty to serve the people in favor of protecting the interests of their wealthy donors. If the suffering of marginalized communities is the price, they seem all too willing to pay it.",1

"A journalist from *The Guardian* was detained last week while attempting to obtain a press credential from the Trump campaign. Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized *The New York Times* reporter Nicholas Kristof on social media for publishing unfavorable coverage — a pattern that has become increasingly common during his presidential bid. He has banned numerous journalists from his events, with some being removed by security personnel due to hostile treatment. Trump has also called for relaxing libel laws, which could make it harder for reporters to investigate and expose corruption. Earlier this year, he sued a website for reporting that his wife had been linked to a scandal involving a foreign escort service. On Monday, Trump made a controversial statement about the press during an appearance on *Fox & Friends*. While discussing recent terror incidents in New York and New Jersey, he blamed immigrants despite no evidence linking them to the attacks. When the hosts brought up the idea that radicalization can occur online, Trump turned his attention to the freedom of the press, claiming, “They’re all talking about it so nicely because it’s called ‘freedom of the press,’ where you buy magazines and they tell you how to build these same bombs.” He then claimed to support free speech, only to immediately dismiss it, saying, “They’re inciting violence. They should be arrested for that.” He added, “They tell you how to make bombs. We should lock them up because they’re committing a crime. Instead, they say, ‘Oh, you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.’” Trump also suggested that online content should be more tightly controlled, comparing it to censorship in countries like China. “We should arrest those people who post that stuff,” he said. “They’re helping create violence. But we don’t want to touch them because of free speech.” While incitement is not protected under the First Amendment, proving intent is difficult. However, if the standards are lowered, Trump himself could face legal consequences for encouraging violence against protesters or suggesting that “Second Amendment people” might take action against his opponent. His growing hostility toward the media raises concerns. Using fear-based rhetoric to target constitutional rights echoes tactics from the Bush administration that led to significant erosion of civil liberties. Trump’s history of attacking press freedoms shows a clear trajectory toward undermining the First Amendment. Free speech and a free press are essential to democracy; without them, the media becomes a tool for the powerful. Only someone insecure would fear the truth. Featured Image via Getty Images/",1
"It wouldn’t be too shocking if George H.W. Bush ended up supporting Hillary Clinton in the election. After all, his son Jeb struggled during the primary season, and the entire Bush family was notably absent from the Republican National Convention when Trump was officially nominated. The Bushes have largely stayed out of the political spotlight this time around, keeping quiet about their voting preferences. However, an insider close to the former president claims that 92-year-old George H.W. Bush will be casting his ballot for the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. This source is none other than Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and a former New York state senator. On Sunday, she shared a photo of herself with the former president at his summer home in Kennebunkport, captioning it: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!” According to a report by The Hill, Caroline Kennedy was visiting with Bush at his Maine estate when the conversation took place. In a later interview, she confirmed, “He definitely said that.” When asked about the claim, a Bush spokesperson refused to comment, stating, “President Bush will cast his vote privately in the coming weeks, and he has no comments on the election at this time.” The Hill also pointed out that several former Republicans from the Bush administrations have already expressed support for Clinton over Trump, including national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.

"Go to www.iPatriot.com and Join the Citizen Journalist Revolution! The Democratic Party has been employing a common strategy of fear and intimidation. If you challenge the authenticity of a black president's birth certificate, you're labeled a racist. This is exactly what Lynn Sweet, Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, claimed on Fox News. The idea that questioning a president’s birth certificate automatically makes you a racist is a clear non-sequitur. First, there are indications that the official birth certificate may have been tampered with. These claims are dismissed as racist accusations. Second, the Social Security number linked to Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut, where there is no evidence he lived. Third, the hospital in Hawaii that supposedly issued his birth certificate didn’t exist at the time. Fourth, multiple inconsistencies have been found on the document, suggesting possible fraud. Has an unchallenged birth certificate ever been shown? No, instead, the response is always a rush to label critics as racists. They lack real proof and rely on the term “birther” to deflect from their inability to produce an original document. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has given in to this pressure… Read the full article at www.iPatriot.com.

I’m absolutely furious and horrified by what I just saw. These “demonstrators” are being called peaceful protesters, but they’re anything but. The media that once criticized the Tea Party now says, “No one condones this violence, but…” But what? There’s no excuse for this! Every person involved in this chaos should be arrested immediately. No exceptions. No explanations. No “you have to understand.” You have to understand that this kind of savage behavior has no place in a civilized society. This is the legacy of Barack Obama, who, back in 2009, wrongly claimed the Cambridge Police acted foolishly. This is on his shoulders. It’s also on the shoulders of every leader who allowed the Black Lives Matter movement to turn violent, including Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton, who helped spread the false narrative from",1

"George Soros claims he is the divine ruler of America and that he has a god-like influence over the nation! Surprising, considering he’s an atheist! But many believe he’s been working behind the scenes to shape America’s future—something that’s definitely true! According to RightNow News, George Soros has openly stated he sees himself as a ""creator"" of major political changes, though he also admits to having ""messianic tendencies"" from a young age. “I used to think I was something of a god,” he once said. “I had these grand visions, but I had to keep them in check or they might have gotten out of hand.” When asked about his remarks by the UK's Daily Mail, Soros stood by his words: “It’s a kind of delusion when you think you’re the creator of everything, but I’ve come to accept it as part of who I am.” He also mentioned on a British talk show, “I often imagine being crazy. My father suffered from mental illness, and I’ve inherited some of that instability. So far, I’ve managed to stay grounded.” Soros built his fortune by investing in global markets, yet he criticizes America for its success while ignoring the real issues facing the poor. In fact, his investments have contributed to economic hardship in many regions. Why doesn’t he use his wealth to help those in need? Because he’s just another radical leftist who only cares about himself. Disgusting, both inside and out! It’s fine! One day, George, you will finally understand who truly holds power! Philippians 2:9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",1
"Former President George H.W. Bush is expected to support Hillary Clinton in the next election, according to a statement from a close associate. The 41st president, part of a long-standing conservative political family, is reportedly breaking with his party, as revealed by a member of another influential political dynasty. Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, shared on social media, ""The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!"" Townsend told *The New York Times* that she met with Bush, 92, in Texas last week, where he expressed his choice for this year's ballot. “That’s what he said,” she confirmed. A spokesperson for Bush told *CBS News*, “The former president will cast his ballot privately in about 60 days. He has no comment on the race at this time.”",1
"Liberals often criticize the hidden donors supporting the Democratic party, yet they too have their own major backer. George Soros has been financing progressive causes for years, from the Tea Party protests to the Women’s March. Claims of political interference have long surrounded him, and it seems he's preparing to do it once more. A fresh initiative has launched, promising to derail Trump's bid for the presidency. Dubbed the “September shock that will end Trump,” the campaign claims it will mobilize a “secret voting bloc” of over 7 million unregistered voters living abroad, including both American expats and “global citizens.” These 7 million Americans overseas rarely cast a ballot. This simple tool can change that — but only if we make it viral: https://t.co/z4l7lekdub — Avaaz (@Avaaz) September 13, 2016  

Interestingly, the campaign was not launched in the U.S., but in London. Avaaz, a registered nonprofit in the U.S., is one of the most influential global activist organizations — and, as expected, has ties to George Soros. The organizers traveled from University College London to Parliament in an open-top bus, playing Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are a-Changin’” while shouting “Don’t vote Trump!”  

It is against U.S. law for registered charities to support or campaign for a presidential candidate, and Avaaz denies any link to the Clinton campaign. However, they were caught chanting “Vote for Hillary!” “Avaaz has created the first global, citizen-driven get-out-the-vote effort,” an Avaaz representative said. “The more people share this on Facebook, the more Americans abroad will see it, and the more we can prevent the rise of Trump.”

Avaaz chose London as the starting point due to its large American expat population and introduced a new tool to help them register to vote.

"While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency paused work on a portion of the Keystone XL Pipeline, two other major energy projects are advancing. In March, the Trump administration approved permits for both the Seaway and Line 3 pipelines, and although actual construction has yet to begin, planning and site preparation have already started. Recently, investigative journalist Sarah Mitchell of The Energy Daily reported on the ongoing development of these pipelines and their potential consequences for local communities and indigenous lands. As Mitchell noted, the Seaway Pipeline will transport crude oil from the Bakken Shale region in North Dakota to refineries in Texas, while the Line 3 project will move oil from Alberta, Canada, through Minnesota and into Wisconsin.  

According to a report from Reuters, the Seaway Pipeline is designed to carry up to 480,000 barrels of oil per day, crossing several waterways and sensitive ecosystems. A spill could threaten drinking water sources and wildlife habitats in both the U.S. and Canada. The Line 3 pipeline, which is nearly 1,000 miles long, will pass through the northern forests of Minnesota, an area home to numerous Native American reservations. “These pipelines cut through some of the most ecologically fragile regions in the country,” Mitchell said. “The environmental assessments conducted by regulators don’t fully account for the long-term risks, especially when it comes to Indigenous lands and water sources.”  

Mitchell also pointed out that the real concern lies in the expansion of oil extraction in the Bakken and other shale regions. “With climate disasters becoming more frequent, we should be focusing on reducing fossil fuel dependence, not building more infrastructure to support it,” she said.  

According to the latest update from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), construction on both pipelines has not officially begun, but the companies involved, including Enbridge and Enterprise Products, are preparing for imminent work. Activists argue that legal avenues have been exhausted, and they are now turning to protests and direct action to stop the projects. “The system is rigged in favor of big energy corporations,” Mitchell added. “If we don’t take a stand, nothing will change.”",1
"This weekend, a violent explosion in Chicago sent shockwaves across the country as citizens questioned whether another attack was underway. President Trump quickly commented on the incident, correctly labeling it a “bombing.” However, CNN faced backlash for criticizing him — despite the fact that Joe Biden had used the same term just moments earlier. The network reportedly removed Biden’s statement from their coverage. In response, Trump publicly called out the network, accusing them of bias. During a CNN segment, Biden was seen agreeing with a reporter’s assessment that Trump’s use of the word “bombing” was “inappropriate.” Later, when Jake Tapper replayed the clip, he again condemned Trump for “jumping to conclusions,” without showing Biden’s original description of the event as a bombing, which occurred just seconds before his response.  

Trump later took to Fox and Friends to voice his frustration, calling CNN “disgraceful” and “the most dishonest news outlet.” “They’re hiding the truth,” he said. “Biden used the word ‘bombing’ too — I was criticized for saying what everyone else was saying.” He also blamed “weak leaders” for failing to take a strong stance against terrorism. “We’ve been too soft, and now we’re paying the price,” he claimed. “This is just the beginning — you’ll see more of this across the country.” He insisted that “we need to stop the flow of people coming into this country, because we can’t properly vet them. Our leaders are not smart — they’re lazy and weak.”

Trump also attacked Biden’s plan to accept over 80,000 Syrian refugees in 2017, claiming that Biden’s approach was too lenient. “Biden let in thousands of people, and now Biden wants to let in even more,” Trump said. “They’re not being properly checked, and we don’t know who’s coming in. Our leaders are not just weak — they’re dangerous.”",1
"While addressing a congregation at a church event in Detroit, Donald Trump caught many off guard by taking the side of a civilian who claimed to have been mistreated by police — rather than supporting the officers involved — and this has caused tension with one of the nation’s most powerful police organizations. During his remarks to a group of African American religious leaders, Trump veered from his typical pro-police stance to criticize Officer Rachel Collins, who was involved in an incident where a non-threatening individual was shot. Evidently concerned about his poor performance among Black voters, Trump offered an unexpected and critical take on the situation, questioning whether Collins had been ""overwhelmed"" during the encounter. ""Did she panic? Was she scared? What really happened?"" he asked. ""Maybe people like that, people who act that way, shouldn’t be doing their job. I saw the video from that incident. The man was clearly unarmed, hands up, trying to comply. To me, he looked like a decent guy."" These remarks came just days after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), representing over 300,000 members, publicly endorsed Trump. However, FOP leadership is now upset, with executive director Mike Smith calling Trump's comments ""unprofessional and misleading."" Smith emphasized that ""every individual, including law enforcement, deserves fair treatment under the law."" While it's not surprising that Trump would adjust his tone to appeal to different groups, this shift has cost him support from a key political ally. His speech to Black pastors was likely calculated, and it's unlikely he would have made similar statements in front of a white audience. With his struggles among minority voters growing, Trump is once again showing his willingness to say whatever it takes to gain favor — but this time, he may have lost a crucial backer. Here's the clip that sparked the backlash:",1
"This is absolutely disgraceful and it's no surprise that it's tied to the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with 'Clinton' in it is always questionable, but this case led to the deaths of countless Africans. They provided patients with ""weakened"" HIV/AIDS medications, effectively condemning them to an early death. The Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla was involved in this scandal… the big question is whether the Clintons were aware. I suspect they were. Cipla was eventually convicted in 2014 on multiple charges related to fraud and the distribution of substandard drugs. The U.S. government imposed a $350 million fine on the company. So why weren’t the Clintons investigated or held accountable for their role? As U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein stated at the time, “This is one of the largest false claims cases ever prosecuted in the district, and the biggest financial penalty ever imposed on a generic drug manufacturer.” From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) allegedly supplied “weakened” HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing illness and death, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was spearheaded by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. CHAI’s efforts to assist AIDS patients are among the most well-known projects of the Clinton Foundation. The report focused on Clinton’s long-standing connection with Cipla, a controversial Indian drugmaker that CHAI used as a key supplier of HIV/AIDS medications to developing nations. It also highlighted the role of Dr. Ravi Sharma, a former Cipla employee who became a key whistleblower, enabling the U.S. government to file a major lawsuit against the company. Cipla was vulnerable to legal action because it also sold its generic drugs in the U.S. market. In 2014, Cipla pleaded guilty to several criminal charges involving fraudulent practices and the distribution of adulterated medicines. “The real question is, how many people died because of this deception?” Blackburn asked in an interview with DCNF. This could bring more scrutiny to the Clinton charities and the Clintons themselves—just when they need it the least. A congressional investigation has revealed troubling connections between Bill Clinton and two Indian-Americans who were previously investigated and",1
"There’s a reason far-left, radical Senator Elizabeth Warren earned the nickname “Fauxcahontas.” She’s as insincere as a $5 bill. Warren got that name after it came to light that she falsely claimed Native American heritage for years, then tried to justify it by pointing to her “Pow Pow’s” facial structure as proof of her ancestry. She constantly criticizes Wall Street, even though she’s built her career and wealth through financial institutions. Warren targeted Donald Trump over house-flipping scandals, conveniently ignoring that she herself engaged in similar practices. We’ve come to expect Warren’s performative outrage, which always seems to come out when it suits her political agenda.

This pattern was on full display during a Senate hearing today, where Warren aggressively questioned Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf about the bank’s scandal involving thousands of employees opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has since fired those workers and warned of more dismissals if misconduct is found. But Warren wasn’t satisfied—she took the opportunity to attack Stumpf from a moral high ground, accusing him of “cowardly leadership” for not firing top executives.

“You haven’t held anyone at the top accountable,” she said. “Instead, you’re shifting blame onto low-level employees who can’t afford legal representation. That’s gutless leadership.”

But where were these same words when President Obama blamed low-level IRS staff in Cincinnati for targeting conservative groups? Where was Warren when it became clear that higher-ups were involved in orchestrating the scandal? What about when Lois Lerner retired with a generous pension despite her role in the IRS controversy? Or when Obama lied to Bill O’Reilly about there being no corruption?

Did Warren call out Obama for failing to hold VA officials accountable for falsifying records to get bonuses? Did she denounce him for creating an environment that led to veterans’ deaths and the suppression of free speech? No. She stayed silent because it wasn’t politically useful.

That’s why Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname “Fauxcahontas.” She’s a phony, self-serving politician who only speaks out when it benefits her. Her latest outburst against Wells Fargo proves it once again. Watch Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren in all her hypocrisy.

"But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. That is what they are supposed to do. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Explaining what is being plotted against them. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. He has to take part in building the country. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. However, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. The elite-businessmen’s media Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. The system developed. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. America is the land of the free. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. End of the scenario. When you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. Selfishness, greed. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm…….   The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. Donald J. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. With the “country,” I mean America, not China or Mexico. The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. Stand up, America. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. I would say treason. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. They just found themselves loosing. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. You can even call them the neo-lords. At the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. Let me say something. And so, less shoppers and buyers. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Trump is here. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. It is literally a deal with the devil. Trump should be proud they are all against him. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants.

The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. Chapter II from my book The Trump Revolution (available at Amazon) Read Chapter I here. They are playing a game they call an election. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. Now we are ready for the whipping. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. The elite-businessmen’s politicians Welcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf.",1
"Trump is currently dealing with a major legal challenge involving his now-defunct educational venture, ""Trump University."" Recently, a federal judge—same one he criticized during a campaign rally—ordered the release of internal documents related to the program. Trump's legal team attempted to block the disclosure, arguing that some materials contained sensitive trade secrets. However, Judge Gonzalo Curiel stood firm, emphasizing the public’s right to know. This ruling could significantly hurt Trump’s political standing. While Trump often dismisses criticism, the idea of a so-called university that misled students and left them in financial trouble is troubling. The judge noted that the release of documents serves the public interest, and it’s clear Trump felt personally attacked by the decision. For over 12 minutes of a 58-minute speech, he berated the judge, accusing him of being unfair. He cited the judge’s Obama-era appointment and previous rulings against him as evidence of bias. He also made a racially charged comment about the judge being “Mexican,” which is factually incorrect—he’s actually a U.S. citizen. Trump University was launched in 2004 as a for-profit education company offering business courses and mentorship. It used the Trump brand to suggest a direct connection to the businessman himself. Trump eventually became a 93% owner and profited from the enterprise. But many students say they received little value for the high fees they paid. The program wasn’t accredited, no degrees were awarded, yet thousands took out large loans to attend. Multiple lawsuits followed, including one from New York State, which claimed the school made false promises and operated illegally. The state sued for $40 million, calling the name “misleading.” In 2010, the name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative. Over 80,000 attended free seminars, while 9,000 paid $1,500 for three-day programs. Some even paid up to $35,000 for premium packages. In the New York lawsuit, it was alleged that Trump defrauded over 5,000 people. In promotional videos, he claimed: “We are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrific… and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.” However, an executive later admitted that none of the professors at live events were actually chosen by Trump.

"Hillary Clinton claims that Christians are prejudiced and unacceptable. In her view, they use “religious language” to justify discrimination. You know how liberals criticize generalizations about groups? That doesn’t seem to stop them when it comes to conservatives and Christians. Oh, and they’re also anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim, apparently. Wow. Read more below! As Written By Ken Klukowski for Breitbart: Hillary Clinton: Christians Are Prejudiced and Unacceptable, ‘Religious Liberty’ as a Cover for Bigotry. Christians nationwide should be alarmed by Hillary Clinton’s harsh labeling of Trump supporters as “prejudiced” and “unacceptable,” especially since she was largely referring to people of faith, as shown by one of her top Democratic allies just days before her controversial speech. While many were shocked by Clinton’s remarks, few have focused on the setting and background. Clinton made these statements at a LGBTQ+ gathering in New York City. She specifically targeted those who are homophobic and anti-Muslim. Observant Christians in 2016 are often accused of being bigoted and intolerant for upholding biblical teachings that define marriage as between a man and a woman, sexuality as sacred within marriage, and gender as divinely assigned. These progressive critics also accuse such Christians of being anti-woman for supporting life from conception. Clinton's accusation of anti-Muslim sentiment was broadly directed at Americans who express concerns about certain interpretations of Islam—those promoting violence and extremism—not all Muslims.

"Hillary Clinton made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night, a move that came in response to Donald Trump’s previous segment with the late-night host last Friday. Both shows were major ratings successes, with Trump’s episode averaging a 2.5 rating share and Clinton’s coming in at 2.7, marking the highest viewership The Tonight Show has seen in over six months. Clinton also outperformed Trump among adults aged 18-49, securing a 0.8 rating compared to Trump's 0.6. While Clinton's show edged out Trump in the ratings battle, it was noticeably less engaging than the Republican candidate’s performance. Aside from a few lighthearted moments, such as Fallon joking about Clinton’s recent illness by wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer, the interview lacked the humor that fans had come to expect. Fallon also brought up a humorous moment when he handed Clinton a bag that Trump had supposedly left behind, containing a photo of Putin in a heart shape, a copy of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” and a set of softballs—referencing the media's criticism of Trump’s ""softball"" interview style. It's unclear why the press expects late-night hosts to conduct serious political interviews, but Fallon clearly tried his best. Clinton, however, seemed more interested in shifting the conversation toward attacking Trump. She criticized him for refusing to acknowledge President Obama’s U.S. citizenship and for previously calling a Mexican-American federal judge “a Mexican.” She also mentioned the Khans, the Muslim family who opposed Trump’s immigration policies. The irony was that Clinton had started the interview by saying she wanted to focus on the issues, not the rhetoric. Politicians often appear on entertainment shows to show their more approachable side. Bill Clinton once played the sax on The Arsenio Hall Show years ago. Clinton missed a chance to connect with the public in a more relaxed way, showing that she can laugh at herself. Earlier this year, she appeared on Saturday Night Live as a bartender and later on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where she opened a jar of pickles to demonstrate her health. Now, with the knowledge that she may have been ill during that appearance, the joke feels less lighthearted. While she doesn’t need to change her appearance, Clinton would have benefited from treating the Fallon interview as the fun opportunity it was meant to be. She’ll have plenty of chances to go after Trump in a",1
"Dear President Bush, I am very interested in purchasing the artwork you recently released. You have always been a remarkable leader and a man of great vision. I have consistently supported your administration and its policies. However, I have noticed your apparent lack of support for the Republican Party and the current presidential candidate, which has left me feeling puzzled and let down. Your quiet stance while key Republicans, including your father, have backed the opposition has made me question your leadership and commitment. History shows that silence can lead to serious consequences. It would be alarming to elect a president who continues to undermine the values we cherish. As I mentioned, I want to buy your artwork—but not if it represents a viewpoint that no longer aligns with conservative principles. I wish to continue supporting the Bush family, but I need to know where you stand. Please clearly tell the American people that you will uphold your legacy by standing against the radical left and defending traditional values. America is in decline, and it must be reversed. I look forward to your response.",1
"If there's one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it's that they're certain about what they don't understand. And what they don't understand could fill a library, as shown in a recent interview with some of them on the September 18 episode of *The Daily Show* on Comedy Central. You might not fault these individuals for the conspiracy theories they embrace — many of those ideas originated from conservative media outlets like Fox News. But when given the chance, several Trump voters came up with their own wild theories that even some right-wing commentators wouldn’t dare repeat. Reporter Jordan Klepper went to Trump rallies to speak with attendees, and what he heard was both shocking and surreal. Trump has often praised the “uneducated,” and Klepper found plenty of them gathered to hear from their leader. At first, people shared rumors about Hillary Clinton’s health. One man insisted she had AIDS, which he claimed she caught from Bill. And where did Bill get it? “From messing around with Magic Johnson,” the man said. We’re guessing he meant the former NBA player, not the ex-president’s “johnson.” It didn’t take long for Klepper to encounter people who clearly lived in a different reality. One claimed Clinton has a secret twin, and when Klepper showed him two identical photos of her, he confidently picked out the one he believed was the “real” Clinton. Another argued that President Obama is Muslim because of the way he wears his rings — a myth that was long ago proven false. The story suggested Obama stopped wearing his wedding ring during Ramadan, but there’s no rule against Muslims wearing jewelry during that time. Still, this man saw it as proof of something sinister. The most outrageous claim came from someone who asked why Obama wasn’t in the Oval Office on September 11, 2001, implying he was involved in the attacks. These people will be casting their votes on November 8. Will you? Here’s the video, via Comedy Central: Featured image via Comedy Central screen capture. Here’s another example of a passionate Trump supporter: according to authorities, he was caught planning to attack a mosque with a homemade explosive.",1
"In this video we shared yesterday, Clinton seems to have difficulty maintaining eye contact. Shortly after this incident, she abruptly called off her high-profile fundraiser in North Carolina, which was set to take place just a short drive from where she was seen. But the situation is more troubling than it appears, as one of our investigators uncovered some concerning details about Hillary Clinton’s recent schedule. Here's an interesting point: I just looked up all of Hillary Clinton’s public appearances between September 20 and October 19 — she has only one event listed as a rally. All the others are fundraisers, and she isn’t even listed as a speaker at any of them. Meanwhile, Trump has four rallies scheduled between September 20 and 22. There are growing concerns about her health, and while I’m not a medical professional, I do know what I see. Recently, I posted that Secret Service agents had to assist Clinton in climbing two steps at a rally. What healthy candidate needs help with that? The agent had a tight grip on her arm. I previously suggested that Clinton wouldn’t be able to hide her condition for long and that a breakdown was inevitable. More rumors are circulating that the DNC is in disarray, with potential replacements for Clinton being considered. The Democratic Party is facing a serious issue, as Sanders continues to act as a loyal supporter of Clinton and shows no interest in running for president. Regarding Clinton’s health, whether you believe in the eye movements or the conspiracy theories, there’s no denying she’s unwell. The Left can’t keep this under wraps forever, and it will prove all the “conspiracy theorists” right. The cover-up will also expose what many already know about Democrats — they’re corrupt to the core. Expect more revelations on this story in the coming days.",1
"Donald Trump is, well, unacceptable. He has repeatedly called for constructing a massive barrier to keep out waves of undocumented immigrants—many of whom he has labeled as ""criminals"" and ""rapists""—from entering the country. He has also supported the idea of registering all Muslims in America, similar to how Hitler targeted Jews during World War II, and even proposed forcing them to wear identification tags. Furthermore, he has floated the idea of detaining Muslims in internment camps as a “temporary solution.” Trump has gone as far as suggesting that the families of suspected terrorists should be killed: “You have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.” But this isn’t just about foreign threats—he wants to apply the same logic at home. In response to recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, Trump’s campaign has claimed he’s not fighting terrorism, but rather the “narratives” of Obama and Clinton. His own “narrative,” according to his team, is “kill them all.” The attacks, which occurred on President Obama’s watch, are being used to justify an increase in fear and hostility toward immigrants. Specifically, 858 individuals from high-risk countries have been granted U.S. citizenship due to what the administration calls “weak policies” backed by Obama and Clinton. Clinton, in particular, is being blamed for her support of a 550% rise in Syrian refugees and her push for open borders, which Trump claims will endanger Americans. Under Obama and Clinton, radical Islamic terrorism has grown, with ISIS now active in more countries than ever. The enemy, according to Trump, doesn’t respect or fear Clinton, and that’s a dangerous position for the country. Trump promises to stop the attacks because he sees the threat as existential, not just political. “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens,” he said. Trump has consistently linked terrorism to Islam, blaming Muslims for attacks whenever possible. How selective will he be when it comes to who gets targeted? As he said in March: “They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage—they have to open up to society and report the bad ones.” If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, does that make them suspects in Trump’s eyes? How long before anyone practicing Islam is seen as a threat? Would mass",1
"Hillary Clinton is pushing to take away your guns. She’s never hidden her support for strict gun control, and now the National Rifle Association is fighting back with a powerful new ad. This latest commercial argues that if Hillary is elected, she’ll do everything in her power to leave ordinary citizens vulnerable. While Clinton and her allies claim they only want “common sense” gun laws, the reality is far more extreme. She’s proposed measures like a 20% tax on firearms and has refused to confirm whether she believes the Second Amendment is valid. She even endorsed Australia’s controversial gun buyback program, where citizens were forced to surrender their weapons.  

But don’t think Hillary hates all guns—she’s surrounded by armed bodyguards at all times, so she doesn’t need to worry about self-defense. Meanwhile, she’s indifferent to the safety of everyday Americans. Her plan would leave people powerless, forcing them to rely on government protection. Police are brave and dedicated, but they can’t be everywhere. In a crisis, without a gun, there’s nothing you can do.  

Gun control hasn’t worked anywhere it’s been tried. Look at Chicago, which has some of the strictest laws in the country yet still faces high levels of gun violence. Australia also continues to struggle with gun-related crime, especially among gangs. The truth is, gun control doesn’t reduce violence—it just disarms law-abiding citizens. That’s why Hillary and her supporters use fear to push their agenda. The question remains: will people believe the lie?",1
"The latest preliminary polls from last night’s debate have been released, showing a clear advantage for Hillary Clinton, who demonstrated composure, confidence, and expertise in contrast to Donald Trump, whose responses were often disjointed and unconvincing. According to a breakdown by The Intercept, the results are striking: A poll of debate viewers by CBS News/YouGov found that 60 percent believed Clinton won, while 28 percent favored Trump. CBS’s David Scherer noted that the sample leaned slightly more Democratic, but the margin still reflects a strong performance by Clinton. Another poll by Pew Research Center, which surveyed debate viewers, showed 53 percent thought Clinton prevailed, compared to 41 percent for Trump. A separate focus group of 25 undecided voters in Nevada, conducted by ABC, found that 21 of them felt Clinton had the upper hand. Additionally, a GOP-affiliated survey by Strategic Vision found that Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly sided with Clinton. Emily Bazelon has further analysis on the implications here. This decisive lead for Clinton is significant, especially since nearly half of likely voters say the debates will influence their choice. It seems that substance, clarity, and credibility continue to resonate with the electorate, and last night’s debate once again proved that these qualities are firmly with Mrs. Clinton.",1
"Over the weekend, former President Barack Obama spoke to the Congressional Black Caucus for the final time during his presidency. He strongly criticized the Republican candidate and urged black voters to support the Democratic nominee. He warned that he would take it as a “personal blow” if members of the Black community didn’t turn out in full force for her. “If I hear anyone saying their vote doesn’t count, or that it doesn’t matter who we elect — look at history. It matters,” Obama said. “I’ll see it as a personal blow — a betrayal of my legacy — if this community doesn’t rise up and make its voice heard. If you want to honor me, go vote.” But not everyone in the Black community is listening. One man, known online as J.T. Cole, has made it clear he’s voting for Donald Trump despite Obama’s plea. According to his social media, he’s a “Veteran, Independent, Family Man, Educated, and Not Affiliated with either major party.” In a recent video, Cole confronted Obama directly, asking what the president would do about his support for Trump. “You say people are insulted? Then what are you going to do to me?” he challenged. “I’ve been insulted by Democrats and liberals for years. I’m done letting them talk down to me.” “I’m voting against them!” he shouted, holding up a ‘Make America Great Again’ flag. Watch what he had to say:

"Hillary Clinton's health has become a central topic in the Presidential race. What was once dismissed as a ""wild theory"" is now gaining attention, as reports suggest she is dealing with severe medical conditions, including chronic neurological issues. Following her unexpected fall during a public event in September, even mainstream media outlets are beginning to question what they once ignored. Now, whistleblower Dr. Alan Cross (below) presents a shocking new theory about Hillary Clinton’s condition — one that has never been discussed publicly before. He claims that Hillary is no longer alive and has been replaced by multiple body doubles and digital projections. If this is true, it would be the most elaborate political deception ever seen. What a revelation!: As reported by Truth Seeker News: Note: Russian intelligence is using my footage to prove they used green screen technology in a recent appearance! It’s all fabricated! You’ll see my video below. According to Russian sources, Hillary hasn’t left her home in weeks and is being impersonated by look-alikes! Also, check out the section where Russia releases supposed evidence of a secret helicopter crash that left her seriously injured! Initially skeptical of Sorcha Faal’s claims, experts now say her report is “plausible.” Major information here! Former journalists Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan covered the incident when it first broke! Do you think Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash and replaced by digital imagery? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",1
"In discussing crime and violence during the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump significantly inflated the number of shootings in Chicago, insisted that stop-and-frisk is both legal and effective, and suggested that guns should be taken from individuals without following proper legal procedures. He argued that the police would handle the removal of weapons from criminals, implying that criminals don’t have the same constitutional protections as others. “We have to take guns away from bad people who shouldn’t have them,” he said during the debate. This statement came despite the fact that stop-and-frisk has been ruled unconstitutional in some cases and has been criticized for being ineffective. It’s puzzling how the NRA could back a candidate who supports taking guns from anyone, regardless of their legal status. This isn’t the first time Trump has made such claims: “If officers see someone possibly carrying a gun, they’ll stop them, pat them down, and take the weapon away. They won’t have anything to shoot with.” The Second Amendment is meaningless without due process. The NRA is backing a candidate who would disarm law-abiding citizens under the guise of public safety.",1
"If you’re like me, you’re probably counting down the days until the Donald Trump – Hillary Clinton debate. Don’t get me wrong — as someone who cares about policy, I’m disappointed to see both candidates avoiding substantive discussion. Trump appeals to a segment of the population that’s fed up with what they see as political correctness and a lack of strong leadership in government. His straightforward, no-holds-barred style resonates with those who feel ignored by the establishment. Hillary, on the other hand, relies on manipulation, selective messaging, and carefully constructed narratives to maintain her lead. Still, the debate could be engaging — Hillary tends to struggle under pressure, while Trump thrives when challenged. Think back to how he handled moderator Candy Crowley in 2012 — it was intense, to say the least. And now, Hillary is entering the debate with a declining lead. While most polls show her ahead, they’ve been heavily criticized for biased sampling and questionable methodology. The Real Clear Politics average currently shows Hillary leading by just 2.3%, and when factoring in bias, the race is essentially tied. As the polls continue to shift, Trump is gaining momentum, and some analysts are starting to take notice. FiveThirtyEight has dropped Hillary’s chances of winning from 71% on September 11th to 57% on September 20th. Despite this, many still place faith in polling data, even as its credibility continues to erode. The truth is, public sentiment is turning against Hillary as more details emerge about her past, while support for Trump has remained consistent. Many assume this is a two-candidate race, but it’s really a contest between Trump, Clinton, and ""none of the above."" Trump's supporters have been with him from the start, seeing him as a symbol of change. Meanwhile, some progressive voters are still upset over Bernie Sanders’ treatment and may not vote for Hillary out of principle. In a head-to-head matchup, the race could be very close. But how many Democrats will stay home rather than risk being associated with a candidate who might lose? And if Hillary can't hold her own in the debate, will that finally make liberals question whether she’s truly capable of leading a nation that’s losing influence on the world stage?",1
"It’s a day of celebration for ISIS and Caliphate loyalists across the globe as they enthusiastically share and celebrate the alleged terrorist attack that took place in a busy Chicago subway and the knife assault carried out by an ISIS-linked individual at a shopping center in Ohio. Following the explosion, social media was flooded with messages from jihadist supporters expressing pride in what they see as victories for their cause. Some of the posts included; “The lions of the Caliphate strike again in the heart of America,” posted by a user named “Sahaba2024,” who later had their account banned. Another, under the handle “Shadow of the Crescent,” tweeted using the Arabic hashtag #ChicagoAttack: “O Allah, punish the corrupt and the disbelievers, let their cities burn.” Others shared messages like “Good news from the West,” while a user linked to Jabhat al-Nusra in Libya posted: “O Allah, bring judgment upon America, the land of the arrogant. Count them and destroy them, leave none standing.”  
Evil is alive and well, and its name is radical Islamic extremism. It rejoices when innocent lives are taken and when fear spreads through Western nations. It mocks Christians, Jews, and all who stand against it. It thrives on violence and seeks to impose its ideology across the world. This evil is now spreading online, where it takes pride in every act of bloodshed. The latest incident is yet another example of this growing threat. As Chicagoans and Ohioans mourn, jihadists around the world are celebrating. Something must be done—but who will take the stand? Watch the video of the attack below.",1
"According to Austin Police, roughly 65% of the demonstrators in the downtown area are not locals, but rather “outside agitators.” “This isn’t a protest that’s coming from our community,” said a representative from the Austin Police Association. “These are outsiders who are being brought in to stir up trouble. These aren’t true protesters — they’re troublemakers.” The officer added that many of the individuals involved were seen arriving on charter buses from neighboring states. “If you check the arrest records from last night, you’ll see that about 65% of those taken into custody had out-of-state licenses. They don’t live here.” In fact, police claim these individuals were transported from other cities specifically to create unrest in the city. A similar pattern was observed during the protests in Baltimore. #AustinPolice: 65% of arrested demonstrators had out-of-state IDs, outside groups are fueling the chaos https://t.co/3Lm8nZq9Xw — TexasWatch (@TexasWatch) August 15, 2017  

These people are supposedly demonstrating against police brutality. While that issue is certainly worth addressing — it’s not justification for burning down a gas station. What’s notable is that the officer involved in the incident was also African American. According to the victim’s family, he was unarmed and claimed he was waiting for his daughter. However, after the shooting, no evidence of a book was found at the scene, but a small, loaded firearm was recovered. Here's a video captured by a bystander during the event.

"While delivering a speech at a community event in Atlanta, Donald Trump unexpectedly took a stance in favor of a police accountability reform movement—drawing sharp criticism from one of the nation’s most powerful law enforcement organizations. During his address to a group of African American community leaders, Trump deviated from his usual pro-police messaging to question the actions of Officer Daniel Shavers, who was involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Kansas City. Concerned about his dwindling support among Black voters, Trump offered a rare moment of reflection, saying: “Did she panic? Was she overwhelmed? What happened? People like that, people who make those kinds of mistakes, maybe they shouldn’t be on the job. I watched that video. The man had his hands up. He was reaching for the car, hands in the air. To me, he looked like he was doing exactly what he was supposed to do. He seemed like a decent guy.” These remarks came just days after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) publicly endorsed Trump. However, FOP leadership has since condemned his comments, with executive director Mark Herring stating that Trump “should respect the legal process and the presumption of innocence, especially when it comes to public servants.” While some may see this as a positive shift, critics argue that Trump is simply trying to court Black voters ahead of the election, and that his comments were likely tailored to the audience in front of him. It’s unlikely he would have made such statements in a more conservative setting. With his support among minority groups in question, Trump continues to adjust his message to fit the room—this time, however, he alienated a key political ally. Here’s the clip that sparked the backlash:",1
"A Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Ahmed, in Umeå, Sweden, is a disgrace! Ahmed has a long history of violent behavior and has been arrested multiple times for assault and harassment. This dangerous individual has been receiving social benefits while committing crimes since he arrived in Sweden three years ago. His latest incident wasn't against a stranger—it was against his own wife. On the night of the incident, Ahmed went out with friends after a day of doing nothing but collecting government support. Before leaving, he told his wife—demanding, not asking—that the niece she was watching must be gone by the time he returned. Knowing his violent nature, she obeyed. But when he came home and found the girl still there, he claimed his ""Islamic right"" to discipline his pregnant wife for her disobedience. He dragged her to the floor and beat her in the head and stomach. To add insult to injury, he poured beer over her, which is strange because Muslims are not supposed to drink alcohol. I wonder where that beer came from. He then finished the abuse by pulling down his pants and urinating on her face and body. Thanks, Mohammad, for teaching how to treat a ""disobedient"" woman, especially when she's carrying your child. Quran 4:34 says, ""Righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them."" But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. It's clear that the prophet himself didn't take these verses literally, as he once told a battered woman to return to her husband and satisfy his desires, and later struck his own wife in the chest. I wonder how some people can pick and choose which parts of the Quran to follow. This man drinks alcohol, abandons his wife, and comes home to beat her with his fists. The Quran says to beat her with a stick, but maybe this man skipped mosque too often—or perhaps someone else is writing a new manual of violence for Muslims to follow.",1
"The Black Lives Matter movement asserts that systemic racism is deeply rooted in the nation’s police forces — and former President Barack Obama seems to back this claim. Instead of acknowledging that mistakes happen in any profession, they generalize and label all officers as racist. And now, she’s seized another moment to push her agenda. Michael Brown was a young black man who was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. According to the footage, Brown was seen with his hands up and turning away from officers when he was shot. He made no threatening gestures, yet he was still fatally wounded. The video clearly shows: this was an unjustified killing. The officers involved should face serious consequences. But rather than focusing on justice, Obama used the incident to attack law enforcement as a whole and stir up racial divisions. Speaking on a popular radio show, Obama addressed the Brown shooting, saying, “We need to confront this deep-seated racism, this tragic incident again, how many more times must we witness this in our country?” “It’s unacceptable and it has to stop,” he declared. Naturally, his solution to this nationwide crisis was simple: vote for him, and things will change! “I can speak directly to white people and say, ‘This isn’t who we are. We must work to reform policing and address hidden biases,’” he said. “We can do better. We have to take control of what’s completely unacceptable.” While he briefly acknowledged the “dedicated and professional” officers across the country, he had no qualms about using this tragedy to gain political support. And that’s disgraceful. She didn’t even wait for Brown’s family to lay him to rest before jumping on the opportunity to ask for votes. Isn’t she ashamed? Doesn’t she feel guilty? Because she should. What she’s doing is blatant racial manipulation. It’s frustrating that progressives so easily exploit racial tensions for their own benefit, while accusing others of being bigots. They’re trying to create division, all so they can climb into power. That’s despicable.",1
"The Black Lives Matter movement asserts that systemic racism is deeply embedded within the nation's police forces — and former President Barack Obama appears to share this view. Instead of acknowledging that occasional misconduct exists in every profession, they generalize and accuse all officers of racial bias. And now, he’s found another way to exploit the situation. John Crawford III was a black man who was shot by police in Beavercreek, Ohio. Crawford was unarmed and, according to the video, can be seen holding a toy gun while standing in a Walmart parking lot. He made no threatening gestures, yet he was shot and killed without explanation. The footage clearly shows: this was an unnecessary killing. The officers involved should face serious consequences. But of course, Obama used it as a platform to attack law enforcement and deepen racial divides. Speaking on MSNBC, Obama addressed the Crawford incident, saying, “We have to confront this systemic issue, this tragic shooting, how many more times will we see this in our country?” he asked. “This has to stop.” Naturally, his solution to this nationwide crisis is simple: vote for him, and things will change! “I think we need to speak directly to white people and say, ‘This isn’t who we are. We have to do everything we can to reform policing, to address implicit bias,’” he said. “We can do better. We must take action.” While he briefly acknowledged the hardworking, honest cops across the country, he had no qualms about using this tragedy to push his political agenda. And that’s unacceptable. He didn’t even wait for Crawford’s family to grieve before jumping in to use the incident for his own gain. Isn’t he embarrassed? Shouldn’t he be ashamed? What he’s doing is blatant race-baiting.

"Jim Carrey could be stepping away from the spotlight for good, and it's truly shocking. The comedian, famous for his roles in films like ""The Mask"" and ""Bruce Almighty,"" has always been a household name. But now, he's facing serious allegations that could end his career. Last September, Jim was devastated when his 27-year-old girlfriend, Sarah Mitchell, died by suicide. She left behind a note that expressed her deep emotional pain and mentioned Jim's absence in her life. After the tragedy, Jim released a heartfelt statement: “I’m heartbroken and completely stunned by Sarah’s passing. She was a beautiful soul, full of light and love, but too fragile for this world. My thoughts are with her family and everyone who knew her.”  

When authorities arrived at the scene, they discovered several prescription medications on her nightstand, including Xanax, Oxycodone, and Zoloft. All were prescribed under the name Michael Stone, which is believed to be one of Jim Carrey's pseudonyms. It was revealed that Sarah had attempted suicide twice before, once in 2014 after a breakup and again in 2018 following a personal loss. Now, she's being accused of giving her the pills that led to her death. The lawsuit claims that Jim provided the medications just days before her passing and even sent her messages asking if she had taken them. Additionally, it's said that she had been using painkillers for months prior to her death.  

Jim was aware of her mental health struggles and the risks involved, making it even more disturbing to think he might have contributed to her downfall. The couple had recently ended their relationship, and in her final message, she wrote, “I can’t keep going without you. I tried so hard, but I’m not strong enough anymore. I hope you understand. I love you, but I can’t do this anymore.” This is absolutely mind-blowing.",1

"Fox News host Sean Hannity made a desperate attempt to paint Terence Crutcher as a dangerous criminal during his radio show on Wednesday, but was quickly challenged by a Tulsa news reporter who exposed the lack of evidence. Crutcher, an unarmed man, was shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby despite having his hands raised and being surrounded by other officers. The incident was captured on video, clearly showing that Crutcher posed no threat to the officers involved. In fact, police have often detained armed white suspects without using lethal force.  

Hannity insisted on air that Crutcher had a history of violence and outstanding warrants. “I’ve heard that Mr. Crutcher has a significant criminal background and was possibly under the influence when this happened,” he claimed. Tulsa reporter Lisa Thompson responded by checking public records and found little to support Hannity’s claims. “I looked into his file and didn’t see any violent offenses,” she said. “There was a domestic dispute order from a decade ago, which was dismissed, and some minor financial issues. No real criminal history.”  

Hannity then shifted to claiming there were warrants for Crutcher’s arrest. Thompson pointed out that no such warrants existed and said she hadn’t seen any credible reporting on them. “This seems like misinformation,” she said. Frustrated, Hannity insisted he had a “source” within the department and suggested the information would come out soon.  

Once again, Hannity tried to deflect attention from the facts by attacking a Black victim of police violence. The truth remains that Crutcher was unarmed, had his hands up, and was killed without justification. Officer Shelby should face serious charges for this senseless killing.",1
"As we witness police officers being targeted and killed, and see unrest flare up every time a Black individual is shot by law enforcement, it might be wise to examine the real data behind these incidents. The number of people killed by police using deadly force is incredibly small. After all, it’s meant to be a last resort. In fact, more white individuals are killed during encounters with police, yet this rarely makes the headlines. Check the numbers below. If Black lives truly mattered to activists, they’d focus on reducing crime and supporting their communities—instead, groups like Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers, and the Nation of Islam often engage in violence, looting, and destruction, frequently in their own neighborhoods. It's chaos they seek—not justice.

"Go to www.iPatriot.com and Join the Citizen Journalist Movement! The Democratic Party has a history of using fear tactics to silence critics. If you challenge the authenticity of a president's birth certificate, you're labeled a racist. That’s what Lynn Sweet, Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, claimed on Fox News. The idea that questioning a black president's birth certificate automatically makes you a racist is a clear logical fallacy. First, there are discrepancies in the official birth certificate that suggest it may have been tampered with. These concerns are dismissed as racist motives. Second, the Social Security number linked to Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut, yet there's no record of him living there. Third, the hospital in Hawaii that supposedly issued his birth certificate didn’t exist at the time. Fourth, multiple errors on the document point to possible forgery. Has a completely verified birth certificate ever been shown? No, instead, critics are called ""birthers"" and accused of racism. They lack real evidence but use smear campaigns to deflect from the issues. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has given in to this pressure… Read the full story at www.iPatriot.com.

"A high-profile police shooting that occurred over the weekend in St. Louis, Missouri, has sparked intense backlash from Black Lives Matter activists and progressive media outlets. A video captured by a drone showed a 35-year-old unarmed Black man named Marcus Johnson with his hands raised being shot and killed by white officer James Carter, reinforcing claims that law enforcement often resorts to lethal force against Black individuals who pose no real danger. However, according to local news outlet The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, investigators found a suspicious item inside Johnson’s car that may have played a role in the events leading up to the fatal encounter. Inside the vehicle was a small bag of methamphetamine, a powerful stimulant known to cause erratic behavior, paranoia, and aggression in users. There are documented cases of individuals under the influence of meth acting violently, ignoring pain, and even attacking law enforcement despite being shot multiple times. Additionally, Johnson had a history of substance abuse and prior arrests for possession and resisting arrest. He was also wanted for failing to appear in court on charges related to drug use and assault. Some witnesses reported that Johnson appeared agitated and uncooperative before the incident, which may have led Officer Carter to believe he was a threat. While the official cause of death is still pending, the toxicology report is expected to reveal whether Johnson was under the influence of meth at the time of the shooting. Share this story on social media to spread awareness about the presence of drugs in Marcus Johnson’s vehicle, which could provide context for the officer's actions. Do you think the discovery of meth changes the narrative? Comment below!",1
"The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. Let me say something, when you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game even if you don’t like them. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. Stand Up America: Donald J. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Trump Is Here. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. America is the land of the free. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. You can even call them the neo-lords. The system developed. With the “country,” I mean America not China or Mexico. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. We want you to do so and so…. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. Explaining what is being plotted against them. They just found themselves loosing. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! They ignore the real issues like jobs and economy and they look for personal issues about Trump and they talk about his personal issues nostop. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. He has to take part in building the country. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. Trump should be proud they are all against him. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. Best case scenario, they hardly mention it briefly, then they try to cast doubts on these scandals. End of the scenario. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm……. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. At the old time the lord was the owner and the ruler. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. Now we are ready for the whipping. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. The elite-businessmen’s media: Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. However, if you head the federation of that sport you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. They are playing a game they call an election. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. That is what they are supposed to do. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. It is literally a deal with the devil. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Mohamed Hamada’s book The Trump Revolution is available for FREE here until the election.  Read Introduction and Chapter I here.  The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable businessmen, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. Selfishness, greed, I would say treason. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. While on the other hand, they avoid Hillary’s scandals. The elite-businessmen’s politicians: Welcome to the employees of the elite- businessmen. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no.

"It's confirmed. Trump's base will continue to support him regardless of his actions or the truth that comes out, even if his financial records expose his ties to foreign powers. During his late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel once again presented a ""Lie Witness News"" segment, this time asking Trump supporters about a fabricated story in which Trump's tax filings revealed he secretly funds Russian operatives, pays his wife a salary, deducts luxury items like diamond-encrusted sinks as business expenses, and has close ties to a convicted sex offender. When asked their opinion, every supporter insisted they would still vote for the Republican candidate no matter what. In fact, they made excuses for Trump to defend his behavior. So when Trump claimed he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a single vote, he wasn’t exaggerating. His followers remained unmoved by the accusations, even accepting his false occupation of ""farmer"" on his tax returns. Here’s the video on YouTube.  
Trump's supporters are truly disturbing, willing to watch the country fall apart just to see their leader win. No matter how much he lies, embarrasses the nation, or commits scandals, they’ll stick with him. The real question is: Will the rest of us stay silent on Election Day and let these extremists take control? Or will we take action and stop Trump from ever setting foot in the White House? If his supporters don’t care about his misconduct, it means he could act with total impunity, which would be catastrophic for the country.",1
"The first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican contender Donald Trump was filled with intense back-and-forth, along with a few controversial moments. NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator, faced criticism during the debate after repeatedly cutting off Trump to ""fact-check"" his statements—only for those fact checks to be largely inaccurate. One of the more heated exchanges occurred when Holt claimed Trump had supported the Iraq War from the start, despite Trump's repeated denials. According to USA Politics Today, Holt then pointed to an earlier interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, in which Trump supposedly backed the war effort. However, after the debate, Cavuto aired the full clip, revealing that Trump had actually expressed doubts about the invasion before it began. “You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? He would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk,” Trump said. “We have to either do it or don’t do it.” He then added, “Well, he (Bush) has to do something or not do something. Maybe he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Maybe we should wait for the United Nations.” It’s clear Trump wasn’t fully convinced about the decision to invade. You can watch the clip here: Instead of focusing on Trump’s alleged support for the war, Holt should have questioned Clinton about her own vote to authorize the conflict, especially since she had more information at the time. It’s no surprise that the media turned what could have been a meaningful discussion into an opportunity to discredit Trump. Fortunately, Trump remained composed and challenged both Clinton and the press effectively. Share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know your thoughts on Monday night’s debate.

"The city of Flint, Michigan is enduring a severe man-made crisis that could have been avoided if state Republicans hadn’t prioritized budget cuts over public safety. When Flint was placed under state control, officials opted to switch the city’s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River—a source that had not been used for drinking water in decades due to high levels of pollution and contamination. This decision led to widespread lead poisoning, causing long-term health damage, especially among children. Angered by the negligence, Flint residents filed a lawsuit against the state. However, Michigan Republicans, led by Governor Rick Snyder, blocked the case by altering local governance rules to require city officials to seek approval from a state-appointed board before filing any legal action. This move has sparked outrage, with critics comparing it to a scenario where a victim must get permission from their abuser to pursue justice. Though Flint no longer operates under an emergency manager, the state still maintains influence through a five-member advisory board, which was established to oversee the city’s transition. The board quickly changed the rules to limit Flint’s legal rights, raising serious concerns about the erosion of democratic accountability. Many believe the state is afraid of being held responsible for the disaster and the subsequent cover-up. Flint deserves the right to take the state to court, but Republicans have stripped them of that power—and if they can, they’d likely do the same to every city in the country.",1
"Warning, Muslims, if you start reciting “Allah” nonstop during a flight, you might face serious consequences! A couple named Omar and Aisha were on a Delta Airlines flight from London to Detroit when the plane was delayed for about an hour on the tarmac. During that time, several crew members observed the couple repeatedly chanting “Allah” and acting strangely. They also noticed that Omar was constantly looking around and keeping his phone hidden. The crew became uneasy and reported their behavior to the captain. After consultation, the captain decided to ask the couple to leave the plane for “safety reasons.” A video captured by another passenger shows Aisha becoming defensive, asking if it was because of “religious bias.” The captain responded that it was a “security concern.” According to a report by Daily Truth, once the couple exited, they were met by airport security who checked their documents. They were eventually allowed to continue their journey on a different flight, and Delta offered them a full refund as a goodwill gesture. However, the couple claimed this was an act of “Islamophobia” and contacted the Muslim Advocates organization, which has ties to foreign interests. The group is now accusing Delta of targeting Muslim travelers, but with recent global threats, airlines are just trying to stay safe. It’s better to be cautious than to take risks. If someone acts suspiciously, it’s reasonable to remove them from the plane. Imagine if they were planning something dangerous—thousands could have been harmed. Safety always comes first. Don’t let your outrage cloud common sense. What do you think? Did the crew make the right call? By Sarah Collins Like Sarah on Facebook Follow Sarah on Twitter",1

"(ABC) ABC unveiled on Tuesday a cross-country journey through critical battleground states, presidential debate locations, and major cities across the nation on the #VoteVoice bus and digital campaign tour, in collaboration with Twitter, TikTok, and Oracle. #VoteVoice kicked off near the Capitol at the Museum of American History in Washington, where the bus showcased the first set of campaign photos submitted by the Twitter community through an interactive, one-of-a-kind augmented reality display. The public will have the chance to view these images at each debate site and additional locations that will be revealed as the tour progresses. ABC reporters Sarah Lin and Michael Torres will accompany the #VoteVoice bus, report from the field, and engage with voters to capture the stories and sentiments of everyday Americans. Their goal is to go beyond the headlines and political rhetoric to understand the true heartbeat of the country. At each stop, local residents are encouraged to step into the #VoteVoice bus and take a photo against a red, blue, or purple backdrop. They can then post the image on Twitter using the #VoteVoice tag. ABC will compile the data gathered during the tour and integrate it into their election reporting. The #VoteVoice bus will function as ABC's Twitter Live headquarters and social media center during the road trip and at each presidential debate location in Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Arizona.",1
"Drugs can be a real nightmare that destroys your life. They take control, twist your world, and rarely let go. One of the latest dangerous trends hitting the streets is a drug called ""Salvia"" — often mistaken for a natural plant, but in reality, it's a synthetic hallucinogen that mimics the effects of marijuana. However, it’s far more intense and unpredictable. Users have reported extreme psychological reactions, with some ending up in complete disarray, wandering aimlessly or collapsing in public places. There are many variations of this drug, each offering different experiences. Some users say it’s similar to weed with no real side effects, while others describe terrifying hallucinations.  

One user, who claimed to know what he was doing, said, “I’ve smoked weed before, I know how it works.” He had no idea he was actually using Salvia. At first, he felt relaxed and happy, but soon his mind spiraled out of control. What started as a joke turned into a full-blown crisis. He was seen staggering and falling, while those around him laughed and took photos. The video ends with him lying on the ground, completely out of it, while the crowd walks away. Drugs can turn even the simplest moments into chaos. This video serves as a warning — if you don’t want to lose yourself, stay far away from this one.",1
"Scroll down for video It's often joked that behind every liberal lies a conservative who was once robbed, and now it seems black activist Jerry Ford Jr. may be the latest to experience that reality. The incident occurred on the campus of the University of Houston when grad student Ford, a member and leader of the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement, was robbed at gunpoint as he approached his apartment. He recalled seeing a young man hanging around near his building, which he initially ignored, but the moment he unlocked his door, the suspect pulled out a handgun and demanded his wallet and phone—both of which Ford handed over without hesitation.  

Interestingly, Ford is currently running for Texas State Representative and leads the Houston chapter of ""Black Lives Matter,"" an organization that has long advocated for cutting police funding across the country. His response to the robbery, however, was anything but consistent. He called for increased police presence in the area, saying, “I hope the police would step up their game and provide more security here because there are so many people walking back and forth to class.” He also pointed out that the off-campus housing isn’t monitored by university police, something he wants changed to better protect students.  

What’s ironic is that just days after calling for more police support, Ford made comments that seemed to excuse the thief, saying, “I would’ve given him money. I would’ve talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position where he feels like he has to come onto a college campus and rob people of what they've worked for?” Right. That’s definitely the solution. Check out Ford's plea for greater police protection here: Source: ABC 13",1
"Tony Stewart is still battling to stay in the Chase, and so far, the odds don’t look good. Tony Stewart’s season has been anything but ordinary. What began with a difficult start due to a wrist injury has now evolved into a strong push for a championship. Over the years, Smoke has been linked to several controversial moments. From being accused of intentionally causing crashes to being involved in an incident that led to a driver’s tragic death, Tony has experienced his share of intense situations. These experiences can weigh heavily on a person. Still, he continues to show compassion in remarkable ways.  

In a recent event, it seems that Tony Stewart’s generosity once again made a difference. According to a racing team medic, Brian Collins, the equipment Tony provided helped save his life. Collins has worked as a first responder for many years and has witnessed the dangers of racing up close. He’s even responded to some of Tony Stewart’s crashes over the years. Now, the roles have switched. Collins was at a dirt track when he lost control of his ATV, sending him flying off and hitting the ground hard.  

You might be wondering how Tony Stewart came into play here. A few years ago, Collins was the one who helped save Tony after a crash, which Tony personally thanked him for. In response, Smoke gifted Collins and his team high-quality safety gear. That gear, including a helmet, is what Collins believes saved him this time. “I think I swerved to avoid something and went airborne, then hit my head pretty hard. That helmet definitely saved me. We all think we’re invincible, that nothing bad will happen to us because we’re good at what we do, but no matter how prepared you are, things go wrong. At the end of the day, cherish your family and live each day like it’s your last, because it might be. We saved Tony’s life, and I truly believe he had a big part in saving mine.” That’s incredible. Tony hasn’t commented on the situation yet, but we can only imagine how he feels. Our thoughts and prayers are with Brian Collins and his family as he recovers from this incident!",1
"Sharia law is one of the most destructive forces in the world, and women are its primary victims. Yet, strangely, so-called ""feminists"" refuse to acknowledge this blatant injustice. Women are routinely abused and silenced, with little to no outcry from those who claim to support them. A recent case from Egypt highlights this disturbing trend, where a woman was physically assaulted by a man for simply wearing a short skirt. The kicker? A court ruled that the attacker had done nothing wrong.  

The incident occurred when 26-year-old Layla Hassan was on her way to work in Cairo when a man on the same bus became enraged by her clothing. He lunged at her, punching her in the face and shouting, “Women like you deserve punishment!” Three bystanders tried to intervene, but the attack continued. The entire event was captured on video. The 40-year-old perpetrator was arrested and confessed to the assault, stating, “She was dressed immodestly, so I had every right to react.”  

To the shock of many, the Egyptian court dismissed the charges, claiming there was no legal basis for the attack. While Western feminists remain silent on the issue, local activists in Egypt have been raising awareness about the growing violence against women. Thousands of women are subjected to abuse each year, often at the hands of their own families.  

But why should we care about women being beaten for their clothing or facing domestic violence? After all, real oppression must be something else—like the fact that some women in the U.S. have to wait a few days to get an abortion or pay for it out of pocket. Or the occasional offensive comment on a college campus. Why focus on Muslim women when American women clearly have it worse? That’s why modern feminism is seen as a farce—these so-called advocates only complain about trivial issues while real women suffer in silence. They should be ashamed.",1
"Why in the world do we still back Saudi Arabia? We don’t need their oil… we could manage without it. Most of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and the Bin Laden family is deeply connected to the royal family. In June, the Saudi deputy crown prince reportedly admitted that the Kingdom has contributed 25% of Donald Trump’s campaign funds. Taking money from a clear enemy is unacceptable—especially when they’re also funding groups that target us. You don’t partner with people who want to destroy your nation. This applies to countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, as well as any authoritarian regime or communist leader. We keep making the same mistakes. Now it's revealed that Saudi Arabia is auctioning off ISIS sex slaves to the highest bidder, including Iraqis, Syrians, and even Westerners. This is horrifying and happening right under our noses. It must be stopped at all costs. Britain should stop arming the Saudis, and we need to cut ties with their leadership and bring our politicians home. They are endangering our people and exploiting women and children. How can we stay silent while this evil continues? From a recent report: It’s no secret that ISIS has been trafficking sex slaves, particularly Yazidi women, but now it's been uncovered that these slaves are being sold in brutal auctions to Saudi Arabia, an ally of the UK. An eyewitness said that dozens of women were kept in a large room, and not only were Iraqis and Syrians involved, but so were Saudis and Westerners, though their exact nationalities weren’t confirmed. Western women have also fallen victim to this system, as ISIS targets non-Muslims for enslavement. These women are not rescued—they're sold into a life of torment. This is the kind of people Hillary Clinton is associated with, taking their money, making deals, and socializing with them. They’re all part of the same corrupt circle. I’ve long argued that the Saudis and Russians are both backing ISIS. We’re being manipulated. Our leaders are complicit. Let’s not elect another corrupt official who doesn’t care about the suffering of women and children. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.",1
"Hillary Clinton has escalated her questionable tactics by involving undocumented immigrants in a fresh effort to gain an advantage over Donald Trump in the upcoming election. This latest strategy reportedly violates 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which criminalizes the “harboring” or “concealing” of undocumented individuals. The law carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, with extended sentences if done for financial benefit. Earlier this month, the Clinton campaign was caught using similar methods at a Democratic event, where two undocumented individuals were brought on stage to deliver anti-Trump messages. According to a report from Fox News, Clinton is now leveraging the “Dreamers” in a new voter outreach initiative called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote.” The program aims to mobilize Latino communities by warning them that Trump’s immigration policies could threaten their status — even though the Dreamers themselves are not eligible to vote. The campaign hopes to use their influence to boost turnout for the Democratic candidate.",1
"This weekend, a violent explosion in Washington D.C. sent shockwaves across the country as citizens questioned whether another attack was underway. President Trump quickly addressed the incident, correctly labeling it a “bombing,” which drew immediate backlash from MSNBC. Surprisingly, the network criticized him for using the term, even though Joe Biden had used the same description just moments earlier. MSNBC then edited out Biden’s statement. Trump publicly condemned the network for the omission, calling them “biased and dishonest.” In an MSNBC segment, they only showed Biden responding to a reporter’s question, where he agreed that Trump was “inappropriate” for referring to the D.C. explosion as a “bombing.” The same clip was replayed later, with the network again omitting Biden’s original wording, despite it being spoken just seconds before his response.

Trump later appeared on Hannity and let loose, calling MSNBC “a disgrace” and accusing them of “deliberately hiding the truth.” “They’re the most biased network in the country,” he said. “Biden used the word ‘bombing’ too — I was called out for saying what’s true. That’s not fair.” He also blamed “weak leaders” for failing to stop terrorism. “It’s a mess and it’s a disgrace,” he claimed. “We need to be strong and we need to stop this madness. I think we’ll see more of these attacks unless we change course.”

Trump also criticized Obama for his plan to accept over 80,000 Syrian refugees in 2017, claiming that Hillary Clinton wants to triple that number. “Hillary wants to let in way more people than Obama did,” he said. “They can’t be properly checked. We’re letting in thousands without knowing who they are. Our leaders are not smart — they’re weak and dangerous.”",1
"Over the past year, growing concerns have emerged about the ethical practices of the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Now, a fresh investigation claims that the organization may be facing even greater controversy than previously believed. According to a report from The Daily Caller, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) allegedly provided substandard HIV/AIDS medications to patients in several African nations. A draft congressional report obtained by the news outlet suggests that these drugs were ""diluted"" and may have put lives at risk. — CHAI, one of the Clinton Foundation’s most prominent programs, has long been praised for its efforts to combat AIDS in developing countries. — If true, the claim that CHAI distributed weakened medications could damage the foundation’s reputation and intensify scrutiny of Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the final stretch of the election. — The report also reveals troubling connections between Bill Clinton and two Indian-American individuals who have faced regulatory actions from the FDA and SEC. In particular, the Clinton Foundation is accused of strongly supporting Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company that was found to have serious quality control issues and attempted to hide them through deceptive reporting. It remains unclear how many patients were affected by the questionable drugs. This new development shows that the Clinton Foundation needs to be held accountable immediately—before it continues to endanger lives globally.

"This video is wild! While I don’t agree with the “logic” behind it, it still highlights how extreme some parts of the Black Lives Matter movement have become. Before I show you the clip, let me make one thing clear: the Black Lives Matter movement isn’t really about supporting black people—it’s more about dismantling the current system and replacing it with something entirely different. Their platform calls for defunding all police departments, demanding race-based reparations for events that happened centuries ago and don’t affect anyone alive today, granting voting rights to undocumented immigrants (which is completely unheard of elsewhere), ending private schools and charter options (as if public education wasn’t already failing), a universal basic income—something already provided through welfare—and free college exclusively for Black Americans (even though it’s not the responsibility of others to cover). So basically, someone stands on the street with a Black Lives Matter sign, and nothing happens. Then they hold up an All Lives Matter sign, and suddenly chaos erupts. People act like they’ve been personally insulted. One person even shouted, “All lives don’t matter, only Black lives matter.” That’s deeply troubling when groups start believing that some lives are less valuable. After watching the video, I scrolled through the comments and was shocked by how many people had no idea what they were talking about. One claimed America had slavery for 600 years. I pointed out that 2016 minus 1492 doesn’t equal 600. Another said whites created racism, so I reminded them who actually enslaved Africans and sold them to the British. Check out the video… based on what I’ve seen from BLM protests over the last few years, I’m not surprised.",1
"Hillary is definitely the most dishonest and manipulative candidate to ever seek the presidency of the United States… Hillary is a calculating liar: A liar is typically someone who fabricates stories to serve their own interests and does so without remorse. A liar is often focused on achieving their goals, regardless of the harm they cause. They show no empathy for those they deceive.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reportedly confessed to journalists that she would alter her approach to immigration policy if given the chance to revisit the past. In a recent interview, she expressed willingness to explore new directions in refugee management, stating, “If I knew what the German people truly want from our refugee policy, I would be open to reevaluating it.” These remarks followed the Christian Democratic Union’s poor performance in the recent state elections in Brandenburg. Merkel described the loss as painful and accepted full responsibility for the outcome, blaming it on rising anti-immigrant sentiment and the growing influence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). She also admitted that she wishes she had been better prepared for the 2015 refugee crisis, which caught many officials off guard. Despite her apparent openness to change, Merkel quickly dismissed the idea of making any real policy shifts, suggesting her comments were more about public image than action. She emphasized that she would not support the demands of the Christian Social Union, which has pushed for a strict annual cap of 200,000 immigrants and prioritization of Christian refugees over Muslims. “If people oppose Muslim asylum-seekers based solely on their religion, that goes against our values and the principles of Germany,” she said. The CSU leader, Horst Seehofer, had previously threatened to withdraw his support from Merkel if she didn’t adopt a stricter stance. With rising concerns over terrorism and crime linked to migration, public opinion is shifting. Some analysts believe this could signal a potential loss in the upcoming federal election or at least a narrow victory. Critics argue that her policies are too similar to those of Obama and Clinton, which has made her unpopular both in Germany and abroad.",1
"Hillary Clinton made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night, a move that followed Donald Trump's previous week’s interview with the late-night host. Both segments were big hits, with Trump’s show pulling in a 2.5 rating share and Clinton’s managing a 2.7, marking the highest ratings for The Tonight Show in over six months. Clinton also outperformed Trump among viewers aged 18-49, earning a 0.8 rating compared to Trump’s 0.6. While Clinton’s appearance slightly edged out Trump in the ratings, it was less engaging overall. The only notable lighthearted moment came when Fallon donned a face mask and used hand sanitizer, referencing Clinton’s recent illness. Another highlight was when Fallon handed her a bag left behind by Trump, which included a photo of Vladimir Putin in a heart shape, a Pink Floyd CD, and a set of softballs—echoing the media’s criticism of Trump’s ""softball"" interview style. Though Fallon tried to keep things fun, Clinton quickly shifted the tone, moving from discussions about her historic role as the first female presidential nominee to attacking Trump. She criticized him for refusing to acknowledge Obama as an American and for his remarks about Judge Curiel, a U.S. citizen of Mexican heritage. She also brought up the Khans, the Muslim family who had opposed Trump's immigration policies. It was ironic that Clinton began the interview by saying she wanted to focus on issues, not rhetoric. Politicians often use late-night shows to appear more relatable. Bill Clinton once played the sax on Arsenio Hall, and Hillary herself previously appeared on Saturday Night Live as a bartender and on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where she opened a jar of pickles to show her health. Now, with the knowledge that she may have been unwell during that appearance, the humor feels less genuine. While she doesn’t need to be overly silly, Clinton missed a chance to showcase a lighter side. She will have her chance to go after Trump in the upcoming debate.

"Just like Barack Obama and many in his inner circle, Hillary Clinton and her team have always had a questionable security clearance. There are likely several individuals with far cleaner records than these people, and that’s not an exaggeration. They shouldn’t be trusted with anything more than a broom. The Daily Caller News Foundation has been fighting for years to obtain documents from the State Department regarding whether Clinton and her top advisors completed required security training, briefings, or courses. These individuals seem willfully ignorant when it comes to security protocols, and they show no interest in understanding what is expected of them. It’s called deniable plausibility. TheDCNF filed a FOIA lawsuit to force the release of these documents, and a judge has finally stepped in. Will they actually produce the files before the election? A federal judge has ordered the State Department to start releasing documents within five days, but I wouldn’t count on it. From The Daily Caller: A frustrated federal judge recently ruled in favor of TheDCNF by rejecting the State Department’s attempt to block the FOIA request for documents about whether Hillary Clinton and her top aides completed mandatory security training. Judge Richard Leon denied the foundation’s request to depose officials, but he did order the department to begin releasing the documents. The State Department has failed to provide any records proving that Clinton or her senior staff received annual security briefings on handling classified materials or secure communication methods. TheDCNF is also seeking similar records for Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan. Huma Abedin, in particular, raises serious security concerns. Yet again, these individuals have ignored previous requests, and I don’t expect them to comply now. It’s clear they feel above accountability. The rest of us would be in trouble for less. Judge Leon is growing increasingly impatient with the State Department’s delays. He has ordered the release of one third of the 400 documents by September 26th and the remaining by October 10th. Bradley Moss, an attorney for TheDCNF, stated, “Judge Leon made it clear how fed up he is with the State Department’s ongoing obstruction of the FOIA process. They either meet the deadline or face real consequences.” I hope this time they actually follow through. It’s gotten old watching them get away with it. This is what we call corruption. In a July 29th response to TheDCNF, State Department officials admitted that their failure to produce the documents",1
"Hillary Clinton skipped a major event in North Carolina. Her team claims the gathering was ""canceled,"" but the truth is she missed the most critical activity for someone trying to stay relevant in politics: fundraising. Sure, Hillary Clinton has plenty of questionable Haitian funds, but compared to Trump, she's still ""financially strained."" Her absence from a fundraiser hints at something unusual. The campaign offered no explanation for her absence, and she hasn’t been seen campaigning either. We don’t expect one. The event was set to take place in Durham, with some of the state’s top Democratic donors ready to pay for access. According to WNCN, it was scheduled at the home of Sarah and Tom Thompson. It was advertised as: “Lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton.” Ticket prices ranged from $2,500 to $95,000. If you saw her on The Tonight Show last week, that was taped in New York days before she received a clean bill of health. Her doctor said she’s “fit for duty.” Still, we haven’t found any details about her campaign plans for this week. Once again, we ask: “Where’s Waldo?”",1
"Former President George H.W. Bush revealed to a small group of attendees at a charity event in Kennebunkport, Maine, that he plans to support Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election, according to a report from CBS News. The statement was made during a reception for the Points of Light Foundation on Monday, where Bush was seen speaking with around 30 guests, as described by a source. 

Linda Richardson, a former New York state senator and longtime friend of the Bush family, shared a photo on social media showing her with Bush and wrote, ""He told me he’s going to vote for Hillary!"" Richardson later confirmed to The Hill that she met with the 92-year-old former president during his visit to Maine, where he expressed his choice for the presidential ballot.

Richardson is an active volunteer with the Points of Light Foundation. A spokesperson for Bush told CBS News, ""The former president will cast his ballot as a private citizen, and he has no intention of commenting on the race until after the election.""",1
"No matter the cause, Leftists are for it—until it affects them personally. They support the military, until it’s time to label soldiers as war criminals. They back law enforcement, until they want to defund the police. Now another example has emerged, as reported by the Washington Times. The same Chicago environmentalists who opposed filmmaker George Lucas’s museum project last month are now cheering the construction of the Obama Presidential Library nearby, drawing charges of political double standards. Juanita Irizarry, head of Friends of the Parks, stated Friday that her group is “excited” about the Obama Center being built in Jackson Park on Chicago’s South Side. Just weeks earlier, the group successfully halted Lucas’s plan for a similar lakefront development seven miles north, after a two-year legal fight. The environmentalists’ shift contradicts their own mission. The Obama Center would involve clearing trees and grass in the park, while Lucas’s museum was planned for a parking lot used by Bears fans. It seems like a familiar pattern: destroying nature for a Black leader’s legacy, or tearing up a lot for a white one. Another clear environmental choice—unless you’re dealing with dishonest liberals and corrupt city politics.",1
"Why in the world do we still back Saudi Arabia? We don’t need their oil… we could manage without it. The majority of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and the Bin Laden family is deeply connected to the royal family. In June, the Saudi deputy crown prince admitted that the Kingdom has contributed 15% of Donald Trump’s campaign funds. Taking money from a clear enemy is unacceptable — and this isn’t the only case. You don’t partner or accept cash from those who want to destroy your nation… period. This applies to Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, as well as any authoritarian regime or communist leader. We never seem to learn. Now it's revealed that Saudi Arabia is buying ISIS sex slaves at public auctions, with buyers including Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and even **Westerners**. This is sickening and happening openly. It must be stopped — no matter the cost. Britain should stop supplying weapons to the Saudis, and our politicians need to leave the Saudi influence behind and return home. They’re endangering us and exploiting women and children. How can we just watch while this evil continues? From Jihad Watch: It’s no secret that ISIS has been trafficking and abusing sex slaves, particularly Yazidi girls, but now it’s been uncovered that these slaves are being sold in brutal auctions to Saudi Arabia, a UK ally. An eyewitness stated that dozens of women were kept in a large room, and not only were Iraqis and Syrians involved in the trade, but so were Saudis and Westerners — though their exact nationalities weren’t confirmed. Western women have also been captured and enslaved, as ISIS targets non-Muslims, including Yazidis and Christians, for forced prostitution. These women are not rescued — they're sold into a living nightmare. These are the people that Donald Trump is taking money from, negotiating with, and associating with. A dangerous bunch. I've long said that the Saudis are funding ISIS, as are the Russians. We're being deceived. Our own leaders are part of it. Let’s not elect another corrupt figure who doesn’t care about women and children being sold to predators. After all, Trump’s wife has ties to this dark world.",1

"(SFGate) Former President George H.W. Bush revealed on Tuesday that he plans to cast his ballot for Hillary Clinton in the upcoming November election, according to multiple sources familiar with the 41st president's remarks — a surprising shift from his party's leading candidate. The statement was reportedly made during a private conversation with Mary Matalin, a former advisor to President George W. Bush and a prominent conservative commentator, at an event hosted by the nonpartisan Global Business Coalition. While the exact number of attendees isn't known, several individuals confirmed hearing the comment. 

This unexpected endorsement marks a significant moment in the long-standing political dynamic between the Bush and Clinton families, who have had a complex relationship since Bill Clinton's 1992 victory over George H.W. Bush. The timing of the statement comes just 53 days before the election and less than a week ahead of the first presidential debate between Clinton and Donald Trump. 

Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, responded to the news by expressing respect for the former president but noted the irony of his support for the wife of the man who defeated him in 1992. ""It’s a tough primary season, and there are a lot of emotions involved,"" she said on CNN. 

The revelation initially surfaced on Twitter when Matalin shared a photo of herself with Bush, captioning it: ""The former president said he's voting for Hillary!"" Matalin is a board member of the Global Business Coalition, and Bush’s team has not publicly addressed the claim. A spokesperson for the former president stated, ""President Bush will make his choice as a private citizen in the coming weeks, and he will not be commenting on the race until then.""

However, some within the administration expressed surprise that the conversation was made public, with one source calling it “disappointing.” Matalin later removed the post, though the original message had already been widely shared. 

While George H.W. Bush has not spoken directly about the general election, other members of his family have taken different stances. His son, Jeb Bush, has remained neutral, while his grandson, George P. Bush, has supported Trump. Meanwhile, several former Bush administration officials have voiced support for Clinton, including former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, who praised her leadership experience. 

The evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families dates back to 1992, when Bill Clinton unseated George H.W",1
"It’s no surprise that Trevor Noah, late-night host and comedian, has never been a fan of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Naturally, he couldn’t help but take to social media during the first general election debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. His tweets were a series of sharp jabs aimed directly at the Republican candidate. Here are some highlights:

"This election will force us to choose between a highly qualified, principled woman and a right-wing, anti-immigrant billionaire. The woman, Kamala Harris, has spent her career advocating for justice and equality, while the man, Elon Musk, has focused mainly on his own interests and business ventures. One group that typically supports Democrats — but has recently shifted toward more conservative views — is the Asian American community. In 2016, 62 percent of Asian Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, and in 2020, that number rose to 68 percent. This year, however, the choice is different. Instead of facing a moderate like Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney, the Democrats are up against someone who embodies extreme nationalism and hostility toward immigrants. And they have a warning for their children: vote for Kamala Harris. Why? Because they’ve seen it before. In a video titled “A Message From Mom & Dad: We’ve Seen This Before,” a group of older Asian Americans urge their younger relatives to participate in the election and warn about the type of leader Elon Musk represents. They’ve ""enlisted some powerful voices in the fight against Trump-like figures: parents."" And they’re not holding back: “This might be one of the most critical elections, because so much is at stake.” Their experiences with historical oppression are central to their message: “We’ve seen this before. We saw it in history, and we don’t want to see it again.” Their concerns about Musk are clear and justified: “Musk is more than just a controversial figure. He’s an arrogant, dishonest person, and I have no respect for him. I’m deeply worried about the country and for you, my children.” Adding a touch of humor (but with serious intent), one parent says: “If you don’t vote for Kamala, and this dangerous figure is elected, I’ll haunt you when I’m gone.” Another threatens to disrupt family gatherings: “I’ll ruin every movie night by making offensive comments, but if you’re voting for Musk, you probably don’t care.” The moving video, organized by the Asian American Advocacy Group, was created to remind future generations of the importance of remembering history and listening to those who have faced discrimination: “As Asians, we understand the dangers of extremism, anti-immigrant policies, and prejudice against minorities. We’ve seen this before, and we want to make sure our community stands united against hate and division.”",1
"In discussing violence and crime during the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump significantly inflated the number of shootings in Chicago and insisted that stop-and-frisk is both legal and effective. He also suggested that guns should be taken from individuals without proper legal procedures. Trump argued that the police would handle gun removals from criminals, implying that criminals don’t deserve the same constitutional protections as others. “We have to take guns away from bad people who shouldn’t have them,” he said during the debate. This stance contradicts previous court rulings that deemed stop-and-frisk unconstitutional and ineffective. It's puzzling how the NRA could back a candidate who supports seizing firearms without due process, especially since this isn't the first time Trump has made such claims. He previously stated, “If officers see someone possibly carrying a gun, they’ll stop them, frisk them, and take the gun away so they can’t shoot.” The Second Amendment requires due process, yet the NRA appears to be backing a candidate who threatens that principle.",1
"The Clintons have a deep connection with the everyday American. They know what it's like to be broke. Hillary Clinton is so in touch with the people. She's just like you. (Except for raking in millions from government contracts and suffering from Chronic Deception and Seagull Syndrome.) Bill Clinton is just like you! (Minus being a convicted sex offender, of course.) Chelsea Clinton is just like you! (Except for getting $600,000 a year from NBC while doing very little.) Bill and Hillary are known for charging outrageous fees to speak at events. We're talking $250,000 or more. Fortunately, their daughter Chelsea is much more reasonable. She’ll speak and pose for photos for a mere $65,000. That’s a steal. But wait—there's more! The Hillary Clinton campaign recently held a “Chat with Chelsea” event at the University of Michigan. And here's the kicker: the Clintons understand that students don’t have much money, so they decided to charge $500 per student to attend. You could also get a photo with Chelsea for a “donation” of $1,000 and gain access to the reception for $2,700. What a deal! So $500 is the minimum. I mean, $500 is nothing to a broke college student, right? Just kidding. Even college students—often seen as loyal Clinton supporters—found it absurd that Hillary would charge hundreds of dollars for a “chat” with Chelsea. “While we support Chelsea’s right to campaign for her mother, we strongly disagree with charging students $500 or more to attend,” said Maya Rivera, president of the Michigan Student Union. “It's especially offensive that the maximum donation of $2,700 gets you a private conversation with Mrs. Clinton.” “Charging so much for political engagement hurts students who already feel disconnected from the system,” added Student Union Vice President David Kim. But listen up, kids. Hillary gets you. She really does. And she thinks it’s crazy that you have to take on debt just to get a degree. Please pay $2,700 to talk to her about it. h/t Daily Caller",1
"CNN has reported through its polling that Hillary Clinton emerged as the unexpected victor in the first general election debate. However, other sources suggest a different outcome. Real-time polls indicate that Donald Trump was the apparent winner of the night. Topics discussed during the debate included the Birther allegations, the email scandal, and Trump’s tax records, among other issues. Check out some of the real-time polls below, which include outlets like The New York Times, Breitbart, CBS News, Fox 29, and WABC News.  

Donald Trump took to social media to express gratitude for the positive feedback he received and for those who believed he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has not publicly addressed the results. The CNN real-time poll showed Clinton at 60 percent and Trump at 30 percent, a significant gap considering most other polls suggested otherwise. This discrepancy has raised questions about the integrity of the CNN poll or the demographic makeup of the sample.  

CNN admitted that their sample leaned more toward Democratic voters, which could explain the outcome. Additionally, the poll showed mixed reactions on whether the debate would influence voters’ choices. So even if Clinton led in the poll, it doesn’t necessarily mean voters will shift their support.  

Despite these so-called ""winning"" numbers, Trump has criticized the media for giving him a faulty microphone and claimed he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s past infidelities. He even threatened to skip future debates, which seems odd given his perceived victory. With the election just weeks away, time is running out for both candidates to sway public opinion.  

Remember, Julian Assange previously hinted at an October surprise from WikiLeaks that could damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We’ll have to wait and see what unfolds.",1
"After collapsing just before stepping into her car following her exit from a memorial event in Washington D.C., Hillary Clinton was later seen at her son's residence looking completely transformed. The change was so drastic that it raised serious questions about her identity. The Hillary seen at the residence appeared much healthier, with a noticeable weight loss, more energy, and an unusual facial structure, suggesting a quick rhinoplasty had been performed. Her nose looked entirely different from any previous photographs, with a subtle downward curve at the tip and a slight bump on the bridge—more characteristic of a Roman nose rather than the straight, Nordic type she’s known for. In addition to the nose, the woman resembled a younger version of Hillary, showing fewer signs of aging. She also lacked the small mole above her upper lip that the real Hillary has. Given the reports of her declining health and inability to campaign effectively, many are speculating that her public appearances will be handled by a look-alike. The question now is whether she will even be physically present during the upcoming debates with Donald Trump. If she appears unusually slim, younger, or without her usual cough and voice issues, it could signal the presence of a double. We should watch closely for any signs of confusion, memory lapses, or physical strain, which would confirm if it’s the real Hillary or a stand-in. The bigger concern is whether the real Hillary Clinton will ever take part in any official duties as president. If she wins the election, it’s possible her double will handle all public events, including the inauguration, State of the Union, and international meetings. This raises the possibility that the real Hillary may not be involved in any decision-making, leaving the administration to operate under the guidance of her clone. If this were to happen, it would be the first time in U.S. history that a president is merely a figurehead, with all power resting in the hands of an unseen entity. While some have questioned Obama's authenticity, this scenario would make those concerns seem trivial by comparison.

"President Obama frequently paints an optimistic outlook on the fight against terrorism. He claims that ISIS is weakened and that there is little cause for concern regarding the spread of extremist Islam across the globe. This is misleading. In reality, we are deeply involved in a cultural battle with radical Islamic groups, and our military actions have done little more than slow down their operations. Still, it’s somewhat encouraging to see that our air strikes are disrupting the financial networks of these terrorist groups. According to a Syrian informant, ISIS has started extracting organs from captured fighters to sell on the black market, as our bombing campaigns have crippled their oil revenue. “A special medical team from the group removed organs from around 20 ISIS fighters who were hospitalized in Raqqa,” the source revealed. “They took kidneys, livers, and other vital organs, which were then secretly transported to a clinic near the city.” The source, who asked for anonymity due to safety concerns, explained that this practice began after the group lost access to its main income sources. “With the destruction of oil facilities, ISIS lost about 85% of its funding, forcing them to seek alternative means of support.” It's clear that the group is struggling, but what the world needs is a decisive and total eradication of extremist ideologies. As long as the West mistakes weakness for openness, it will be difficult to achieve the strong leadership required to end this threat.",1
"Republican candidate Donald Trump was completely outmaneuvered by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the debate this evening, struggling to respond coherently to her calm, well-reasoned arguments. Whether it was immigration, healthcare, foreign policy, or his own financial history, Trump appeared flustered and unprepared, unable to counter the clear evidence of his own inconsistent positions and self-serving agenda. Immediately following the debate, Trump launched into another desperate attempt to deflect blame, insisting the system is ""fixed"" against him despite his repeated missteps. He continues to cling to this absurd narrative, ignoring the fact that his erratic behavior and questionable past have left most Americans unwilling to back a divisive leader with a long record of unethical dealings. This refusal to take responsibility not only undermines his credibility but also threatens the integrity of our democratic process. His microphone was clearly working, as he repeatedly interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton, failing to back down from baseless attacks. His immature conduct throughout the night proves he lacks the temperament to lead the country, and this weak excuse only adds insult to injury.",1
"A recent probe has uncovered that Donald Trump’s charitable organization funneled donor money to cover his legal expenses, violating rules that forbid nonprofits from using funds for personal or business gain. Using a simple signature, Trump diverted the average annual income of five workers to pay off his corporate debts: According to court records and interviews, Trump’s foundation spent over $250,000 to settle lawsuits tied to his for-profit ventures, including cases involving Trump University and Mar-a-Lago. These settlements, which totaled $258,000, are part of a growing list of transactions that may have broken “self-dealing” laws—rules that prevent nonprofit executives from benefiting financially from their own organizations. 

The Washington Post’s David Farenthold has been relentlessly tracking every detail of the Donald J. Trump Foundation, using a well-worn notebook (photographed in recent reports) to conduct a thorough fact-check of Trump’s history of questionable financial dealings. His latest findings have prompted major Florida newspapers to demand a federal inquiry into the Trump University scandal, where the same foundation that funded Trump's lawsuits also illegally contributed to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s campaign.

Farenthold’s reporting also revealed that Trump used the foundation to pay a $120,000 fine related to Mar-a-Lago’s flagpole dispute with Palm Beach. Instead of donating to a veterans’ charity as required, Trump took the money from the foundation, which is largely funded by other donors. This wasn’t just a donation—it was a direct financial boost to one of Trump’s most valuable properties. 

In another instance, Trump’s New York golf course settled a lawsuit by donating to a charity chosen by the plaintiff. The Trump Foundation paid $158,000, according to tax filings. Additionally, the foundation was used to purchase a 6-foot portrait of Trump, a $12,000 Tim Tebow helmet, and a second self-portrait, along with $5,000 in ads for his hotel chain. 

The New York Attorney General has already launched an investigation into the Trump Foundation’s improper use of funds, and these new revelations align with a pattern of financial misconduct that has followed Trump throughout his career. As he continues to promote his businesses on the campaign trail, it’s clear that Trump has little regard for ethical boundaries—so long as he can avoid consequences. Here’s proof that Trump used donor money to pay off",1

"During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump claimed he never sought support from Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino expansion, saying, “He would’ve given it to me if I wanted it.” But if that’s true, then Trump may have committed yet another serious legal violation—this time, perjury—according to a report by *Newsweek*. The story suggests one of these accounts is a calculated lie. Unlike Trump’s usual fabrications, this one reveals a pattern: he invents stories when he doesn’t want to admit defeat. Assume the version he gave during the debate is the false one. While Bush’s account supported what Trump had been saying at rallies—that he played the “cash for favors” game for years—he couldn’t admit he had tried the same in Florida because he couldn’t bring himself to say he had failed. Instead, he looked the American public in the face and lied. Then he added another boast: His team is so powerful that they would have secured casino gambling in Florida regardless of Bush’s stance—if Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below reveal a factual dispute between two candidates, but not just any fact—it’s one both men should have known. After Trump’s failed attempt to push gambling into Florida against an anti-gambling Republican governor, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald argues that either Trump lied directly to a former official on live TV (and the moderators let him get away with it) or: consider the other possibility—that Trump lied under oath in a 2007 deposition. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida but claimed he was tricked by someone named Fields. The motive is clear—Trump wants money from someone who no longer works for him, and this story lets him deny any personal flaws. Why does this matter? In the 1990s, Republicans impeached President Clinton for lying in a deposition about a personal scandal. The media fixated on the ""scandal"" for years. Now, the GOP has nominated a candidate known for his dishonesty. Unlike his other lies, this one was either told in a Florida courtroom or to a national audience to undermine his opponent by twisting the truth. Trump's habit of distorting reality isn’t just a flaw—it’s a threat to our democracy. Check out the two transcripts *Newsweek* released and decide for yourself if Trump lied under oath or misled the debate stage. Compare",1
"It would be naive to claim that all firefighters are noble heroes. Like any job, there are many hardworking, dedicated individuals and, unfortunately, a few who fall short of the standard. Firefighters are human beings, and sometimes they make errors, and at times, they may act recklessly or even with poor judgment. However, in a profession where people risk their lives to save others, I believe it's fair to say that the overwhelming majority of firefighters in America are committed professionals who deserve respect and should not be unfairly scrutinized for split-second decisions made under extreme pressure. But don’t tell that to the Progressive Legislative Coalition… The group is pushing for radicalized and politically-motivated fire chief Maria Torres to take action against firefighters to prevent them from using force against individuals who are clearly threatening. Of course, they don’t phrase it quite like that, but that’s the underlying goal. Citing recent high-profile incidents involving armed individuals who threatened firefighters, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, delivered a fiery speech outside the fire department headquarters while the media stood by, eager to amplify her message. “The public is watching and we can’t keep turning a blind eye to these tragedies,” she proclaimed, with the coalition cheering in support. The statement calls on Torres to “intensify investigations and bring charges against any firefighter who uses excessive force against unarmed individuals, regardless of race.” On the surface, this seems reasonable… if those individuals are truly innocent. Yet, in many of these high-profile cases, the story told by activists often contradicts the facts that come out after biased groups have already shaped a misleading narrative that serves their agenda.",1
"Back in August, following her tardy arrival at a campaign event in Nevada, Hillary was confronted by Ed Hendy, who asked, “The FBI believes you tried to wipe the entire server. Did you try to wipe the entire…so there could be no email—no personal, no official; wipe the whole thing?” Hillary appeared confused, taking the question literally, and responded, “Like with a cloth or something?” I believe she was faking it, as she had previously used BleachBit, a powerful tool for permanently erasing emails, which Trey Gowdy once described as “so effective that even God couldn’t recover them.” He called it “further evidence that Clinton had something to hide when she deleted her personal emails from the private system she used as Secretary of State.” Considering her history of deception, I’m not surprised. Recently, we’ve uncovered clear evidence that Hillary researched methods to delete emails without a trace. Paul Combetta, an IT expert who assisted in wiping her server, posted on online forums seeking guidance on how to erase digital evidence. Although he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a congressional hearing, he was very vocal when asking other IT professionals for help in forging Clinton’s emails. As reported by Gateway Pundit: BREAKING: Citizen Journalist reveals HUGELY damaging Clinton email story PROVING Hillary ORDERED EMAILS TO BE ERASED! #MAGA https://t.co/m5fYUmibpT — Rep.

"Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s team reportedly asked for a platform to help her appear more imposing during the debate against Republican nominee Donald Trump — a raised step that would allow her to stand at eye level with the 6’2” former businessman. At just 5’4”, Clinton was allegedly concerned about appearing physically disadvantaged next to Trump, but the debate commission denied the request. Instead, as reported by Fox News, they will construct a custom stage that levels the playing field. But that’s not all! Clinton’s team also inquired if there would be any breaks during the two-hour debate, only to be told no. Moderator Lester Holt has no power to pause the event, even if Clinton experiences another health issue. It was also confirmed that both candidates’ microphones will be left unaltered, ensuring nothing is hidden from the public. Can Clinton endure the intense pressure of facing Trump directly without a medical setback? The debate was expected to attract over 90 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched political events ever. A major stumble or health crisis could severely hurt her chances. Just last week, Clinton had a sudden coughing fit at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. If something similar happens, or worse — she loses balance — it could damage her campaign irreparably. The upcoming debate is shaping up to be a high-stakes showdown. Share this story on Facebook and Twitter and leave your thoughts in the comments below.

"If Donald Trump has his way, the constitutional right to a fair trial will only be available to people who share his political views. Following the recent explosion in Chicago, law enforcement successfully captured a suspect named Jamal Hassan after a brief confrontation. Hassan was injured and taken to the hospital for treatment of his wounds. As an American citizen, he is also entitled to legal representation, even if he can't afford it. That's because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments ensure these rights. However, Republican candidate Donald Trump has criticized the handling of Hassan's case, claiming that he's receiving too much care and legal support. During a speech in Ohio last week, Trump expressed frustration over Hassan being treated by top medical professionals and having access to a skilled defense lawyer. ""Now we're giving him excellent medical care. He'll be treated by some of the best doctors around. He'll have a nice room and maybe even get room service, just like everyone else. And on top of that, he'll have a great lawyer. His case will drag on for years, and in the end, people will forget about it, and his punishment won't be what it should be. What a terrible outcome."" Trump, who has previously supported harsh interrogation methods, called for a quick trial with ""severe consequences"" and suggested using ""any legal means necessary to extract information from the suspect before it's too late."" Here's the video via YouTube.  
The Fifth Amendment states: No person shall be accused of a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury... nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. Hassan is innocent until proven guilty. Denying him proper medical care could result in severe complications or even death, which would violate his right to due process. The Sixth Amendment guarantees every individual the right to legal counsel, even in cases involving serious crimes. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to confront witnesses, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, and to have the assistance of counsel. This right has long been a cornerstone of American justice, as seen when John Adams defended British soldiers after the Boston Massacre. In short, no matter who the accused is or what they're charged with, they deserve due process and legal representation. But Donald Trump seems to want to put a ""conservative-only",1

"Bloomberg News is set to make history by becoming the first 24-hour cable news network to provide live, on-screen fact checking during a presidential debate tonight. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has already released a 20-page document detailing the numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements made by her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump. With Trump averaging one false claim every 3.5 minutes of public speaking, fact-checkers at Bloomberg will be under significant pressure, as reported by Politico. Bloomberg TV will display real-time fact checks during Monday night’s debate, a move that distinguishes it from other major networks, which have not committed to similar on-air verification. While most will handle fact checking in post-debate segments, Bloomberg is taking a bold step to inform viewers as the debate unfolds. NPR is also enhancing its online fact-checking efforts, and all networks plan to review claims after the candidates finish speaking. However, with 100 million Americans and global viewers watching live, this moment is critical for truth-telling. Bloomberg is leading the way, while NBC News has chosen not to follow suit. NBC’s moderator, Lester Holt, a registered Republican, will preside over the event. It’s hoped that all major networks will improve their fact-checking capabilities for the remaining debates, including one moderated by Fox News’ Chris Wallace, which has been labeled a “fact-free” discussion. While some voters may not prioritize factual accuracy, it’s crucial for moderates and independents who are still deciding based on policy issues. This election could mark a shift toward a “post-truth” era if misinformation goes unchecked. Tonight’s debate starts at 9 p.m., and you can stream it online here.",1
"Former President George H.W. Bush is expected to support Hillary Clinton in the next election, according to a new report from The New York Times. The 41st president, part of a long-standing conservative political family, has reportedly decided to break with his party, as revealed by a prominent figure from another influential political lineage. Mary Meade, a former Virginia governor and granddaughter of Senator Eugene McCarthy, shared on Twitter, ""President Bush told me he’s voting for Hillary!"" Meade claimed she met with Bush, 92, during a visit to his Texas ranch last week, where he expressed his choice for this year’s ballot. “He was very clear,” she said. “The vote he’ll cast as a private citizen in about 60 days will remain just that: a private decision.” A spokesperson for Bush told CNN, “He has no official stance on the presidential race and will not be making any further comments until after the election.”",1
"Over the weekend, former President Barack Obama spoke to the Congressional Black Caucus for what may be his final address as a sitting leader. He criticized the Republican candidate and urged black voters to support the Democratic nominee. Obama warned that he would take it as a “personal blow” if members of the Black community failed to turn out for her. “If I hear anyone say their vote doesn’t matter, that it doesn’t affect the outcome — look at history. It always matters,” Obama said. “I’ll see it as a personal betrayal — a betrayal of everything we’ve fought for — if this community steps back and doesn’t get involved in this election. If you want to honor me, go vote.” Yet, not everyone in the Black community is listening. One man, known online as J.T. Cole, has made it clear he’s voting for Donald Trump, despite Obama’s plea. According to his social media profile, he’s a “Veteran, Independent, Husband, Educated, Proud American.” In a recent video, Cole confronted Obama directly, asking what the president would do about his decision. “You keep talking about insults,” Cole said. “So what are you going to do about it?” “I’ve been insulted by Democrats and liberals for years,” he continued. “I’m done letting them tell me how to vote.” He then held up a ‘Make America Great Again’ flag, declaring, “This is my choice.” Watch what he had to say:

"Anyone who has battled a substance use disorder understands how difficult it is to break free from the cycle. Whether it's alcohol, opioids, cocaine, or prescription medications, achieving even a single day of sobriety can feel like a major victory. A man who once struggled with methamphetamine addiction recently shared on Reddit what happened when he finally made the decision to change his life and escape the grip of his addiction. The transformation is undeniable.  
Addiction affects every part of a person’s life—mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Breaking free is never easy, but it's essential for the health of the individual and those around them. This man's journey began after a series of failed attempts to quit, which eventually led him to a court-mandated rehab program. He had been using daily for over a year, and after multiple relapses, he was sentenced to 28 days in jail before entering treatment. His mugshot at the time showed the toll the addiction had taken on his body and mind.  
After committing himself to recovery, his life took a complete turn. In the “after” photo, he’s shown 714 days sober, still going strong. In his Reddit post, he wrote: “There are people out there who are still trapped in that same place I was in that picture. If even one of them sees this and decides to get help, then it was all worth it.”  
If you or someone you care about is dealing with addiction, know that reaching out for help is a brave and important step. It may not be welcomed at first, but in time, they’ll understand that you were trying to save their life. No one should have to suffer from addiction any longer than necessary.",1
"The country's leading immigration official recently claimed that the “12 million” undocumented individuals in the U.S. are “here to stay,” effectively treated as citizens, and criticized the administration for trying to remove just a small number: THIS IS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY! SKIP TO THE 23:45 MARK FOR HIS REMARKS ON ILLEGALS: In a shocking development, over 900 immigrants from high-risk terror regions have been mistakenly given U.S. citizenship, according to a new report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general. These individuals, who were supposed to be deported, were instead naturalized because their fingerprints weren’t in the system, allowing them to bypass background checks. At least three of those granted citizenship are now under FBI investigation for possible terrorist ties, sources revealed. However, in most cases, these former illegal immigrants have not faced legal consequences for their fraudulent actions. Only a handful of the more than 900 cases have led to charges. One of the individuals who received citizenship through this flawed process is now employed as a federal agent, while others work in critical security roles, including at major airports. “USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 900 people who had been ordered deported or were removed under different names, as their digital fingerprint records were missing from the DHS database,” the inspector general stated. The 900 cases involved people from “high-risk” countries or neighboring regions known for significant immigration fraud. High-risk countries are those deemed a threat to national security by the U.S. government. WHAT’S EVEN MORE DISTURBING: Investigators uncovered an additional 1,020 cases last year that raised serious concerns. The issue, according to the audit, is that thousands of illegal immigrants and criminals have outdated paper files that haven’t been digitized. USCIS wasn’t reviewing these old records, so it didn’t realize they were ineligible or had already been ordered out of the country. While some fingerprints have been scanned, the inspector general found 152,000 individuals who were deported but still don’t have digital records in the IDENT system. Read more: WT",1

"Maybe Clinton was actually thinking of Elon Musk, her guest “star” for her debate against Trump. Here is a video of Musk discussing diversity. Instead, he ends up revealing his own biases. Liberals preach inclusion and equality, yet they often fail to practice what they preach, quickly pointing out race while ignoring their own blind spots. As a Conservative and Republican, I rely on data. The statistics on tech industry representation would make me naive not to question the lack of diversity. Liberals escape reality to support their ideals, but then they can't accept the conservative stance on facts and logic when it suits them. That’s why Elon Musk is biased. But it could be worse.

"Another day in ""Obama’s America""... another riot. This madness is becoming the new normal, and it's completely unacceptable. This time, police shot an armed man who was acting aggressively, and the BlackLivesMatter group went completely out of control! I mean *really* out of control—full-blown chaos. They’ve fallen back into their rioting mode again. His family claims he wasn’t holding a weapon, but a *notebook*. A notebook, people. What’s that smell? Oh… it’s just nonsense. So now we have a fatal police shooting, and the police are under immediate fire. Reporters are getting pelted with debris, innocent people are having their cars smashed and set ablaze, and stores are being looted. Free phones and gadgets for everyone! Because they’re mourning someone’s death, the country is against them, and now they’re stealing what they couldn’t afford… that makes everything better, right? Idiots. This isn’t a protest—it’s pure stupidity in action. Now, word is coming in that a local delivery driver was targeted by the rioters. His van was ransacked, and his goods were set on fire. But that’s not all… He tried to call the police, but by the time they arrived, it was too late. For all he knew, his life was in danger, and that’s exactly the terror he faced. It really gets me. Who do they think they are? And more importantly, where the HELL is Obama? I’ll tell you where—he’s laughing. At you, at me, and at all the naive liberals who still believe in his so-called hope and change. The only hope he cares about is the one he can destroy. As for change? He’s nailed that one perfectly.

"Another day, another racially charged remark from Donald Trump. As tensions flare in Detroit, Michigan, Trump — in a weak effort to appear statesmanlike — attributed the protests to drug-related issues, offering no evidence to support his assertion. The comment came during a rally in Cleveland, where he said, “If you haven’t noticed, drugs are a huge part of what’s going on out there.” While Trump seems oblivious, the reality is that the unrest stems from deep-seated racial inequality and the ongoing killings of unarmed Black individuals by police. What Trump is promoting is a harmful stereotype: that Black people are inherently linked to drug use and violence. The data tells a different story — white Americans use and sell drugs at higher rates than Black Americans, yet they face far lighter consequences. This narrative not only reinforces damaging stereotypes about Black communities but also diverts attention from the real drug crises impacting white populations, such as the opioid epidemic sweeping through rural areas. Recent studies show that Black youth are less likely to struggle with hard drug dependency compared to their white counterparts. Yet, the blame continues to fall on Black communities. Instead of spreading fear and misinformation, Trump should look at places like West Virginia or Ohio, where the opioid crisis is devastating white communities without sufficient national response. Trump claims his administration would prevent such unrest, but would he address the systemic racism behind the shootings of Black citizens? Would he confront the racist dog whistles that continue to shape public perception? If he keeps pushing these messages, he risks losing Black voters in the upcoming election.",1
"What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. Trump should be proud they are all against him. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. Donald J. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Chapter II from my book The Trump Revolution (available at Amazon) Read Chapter I here. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. Now we are ready for the whipping. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Trump is here. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. I would say treason. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. They just found themselves loosing. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. The system developed. He has to take part in building the country. They are playing a game they call an election. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. End of the scenario. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. It is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Let me say something. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm…….   The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. At the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. The elite-businessmen’s politicians Welcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. The elite-businessmen’s media Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. Selfishness, greed. America is the land of the free. With the “country,” I mean America, not China or Mexico. You can even call them the neo-lords. Explaining what is being plotted against them. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. We want you to do so and so…. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines.

And so, less shoppers and buyers. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. When you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. However, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. Stand up, America. That is what they are supposed to do. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off.",1
"From the ""Unbelievable But True"" Department comes this tale about the latest words that radical leftists are trying to erase from the English language, all because of some imagined slight or offense. Now, believe it or not, the phrase ""American Pie"" has been labeled as offensive by a university filled with ideologues. The folks at Campus Reform, who track these absurdities, report: Students at West Virginia State University were recently told to alter the theme of an “American Pie” event after the administration called it “problematic.” According to internal emails obtained by Campus Reform, a staff member named Michael Chen sent a message to campus organizations on September 5, inviting them to collaborate on an American-themed celebration with several residence halls. What in the world is offensive about “American Pie”? Can you think of anything? Me neither. But according to the emails, the term was somehow considered “patriotic and militaristic.” No way. Perhaps it’s the word “American” that sets these people off. It's becoming clear that the Left wants to silence any speech they don't like. Is political correctness really this extreme?

"The FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, in which they admitted to potential wrongdoing but ultimately chose not to press charges, has sparked a major backlash… and it appears that FBI Director James Comey could be the first to face consequences as accountability begins. Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton’s key advisors, including her chief strategist, Cheryl Mills, despite her refusal to cooperate with the FBI and allegedly withholding access to her personal computer during the probe. Now, the House Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing on September 28th to determine whether Comey should remain in his position.  

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has publicly demanded Comey’s resignation, and when that didn’t happen, he pushed for his removal. “This raises serious concerns about the director’s ability to lead the FBI,” DiGenova stated. He argued that the FBI should have used a grand jury and issued a subpoena for Mills’ computer. “The way this investigation was conducted is a disgrace to the FBI because they shielded individuals who may have committed crimes without properly investigating them first,” he said. “This wasn’t an actual inquiry—it was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to appear legitimate.” DiGenova has called for congressional oversight, and it seems lawmakers are taking notice.  

Comey will soon be forced to explain his actions, not just in a hearing, but under a formal subpoena from Congress. The committee has repeatedly asked for documents related to the Clinton email case, and Comey has consistently refused to provide them. In response, Texas Representative Lamar Smith has issued a subpoena requiring Comey to turn over the materials. How loyal is Comey to Clinton? Is he willing to risk his career—or even jail—to protect her? And if the answer is yes, then the next question is: why?",1
"Silicon Valley is reportedly panicking over the possibility of Donald Trump winning the presidential election in November, fearing it could bring their worst fears to life. To counter this, major tech firms have poured significant resources into voter registration efforts, with millions being spent to increase turnout — likely in favor of Hillary Clinton. Companies such as Facebook and Google are actively backing liberal voter registration initiatives, according to a report by Breitbart. As written by Joel B. Pollack, TechCrunch recently highlighted that Silicon Valley’s leading companies, including Google and startups like Sam Altman's VotePlz, are working aggressively to boost voter registration. In an article titled “Tech Is Desperate to Save This Election,” reporter Kate Conger noted that while many claim to be neutral, the growing support for Trump has pushed tech leaders into action. VotePlz, for instance, launched a million-dollar registration incentive program, offering rewards to users who help register others. The platform also allows users to check their registration status, assists with online registration, and even prints and mails forms where required. It also features a social leaderboard to track referrals. Full Story Here: Report: Silicon Valley ‘Is Trying to Fix This Election’ – Breitbart",1
"The country’s leading immigration official recently claimed that the “12 million” undocumented immigrants in the U.S. are “here to stay,” effectively functioning as citizens, and warned that removing even a small number of those the government wants out is unacceptable: THIS IS A DIRECT THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY! WATCH FROM THE 23:45 MARK FOR HIS REMARKS ON IMMIGRANTS: In a shocking development, over 700 undocumented individuals from “high-risk” terror regions have now been granted U.S. citizenship due to a major oversight. According to a recent report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general, hundreds of immigrants who were supposed to be deported were instead given citizenship because their fingerprints weren’t in the system for verification. At least three of these individuals are currently under FBI investigation for possible terrorist ties, sources revealed. However, in most instances, federal authorities have not pursued any legal action against these former immigrants-turned-citizens, despite potential fraud. Only a handful of the more than 700 cases have led to charges. One of those granted citizenship through this flawed process is now working as a security guard, while others hold positions in high-security environments, including two who worked at major airports. “USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 700 people who had been ordered removed under different identities when their digital fingerprint records were missing from the DHS database,” the inspector general stated. These cases involved individuals from “sensitive” countries known for significant immigration fraud. Sensitive countries are those deemed a risk to U.S. national security. WHAT’S EVEN MORE DISTURBING: Investigators last month uncovered an additional 900 cases that raised red flags. The issue, as outlined in the audit, stems from thousands of old immigration files still stored on paper, making it impossible for officials to verify whether applicants were previously deported or ineligible. While some fingerprints have been digitized, the report found 130,000 individuals who had been ordered out of the country but whose fingerprints are still not in the IDENT system used for checks.

"I’ve made up my mind to stop supporting the NFL. There are some amazing athletes and coaches in the league, but until Commissioner Goodell takes a stand against disrespecting the National Anthem, the military, and law enforcement, I can’t be part of it. If you truly care about this country, you should care more about its values than any sport or celebrity. What these entitled, rich athletes are doing is not only ungrateful, but it’s also divisive and dangerous. They’re fueling a racial divide. A few Philadelphia Eagles players raised their fists in a Black Power salute during the National Anthem at a game in Chicago on Monday night. That was unacceptable, and I’m done tolerating this kind of behavior. Ever since Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the National Anthem, it’s been a constant source of anger for me. It’s spread to colleges, high schools, and other sports. This needs to stop. It’s that simple. To make matters worse, the Obamas have done the same thing. It’s a provocative, racist act and completely unacceptable. I’d compare it to a Nazi salute — both are offensive and harmful. Even Sports Illustrated has aligned with Black Lives Matter. From Gateway Pundit: It's an Obama world. Last week, NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now, they're raising the Black Power fist. On Monday, four Eagles players did just that during the National Anthem. Malcolm Jenkins and some teammates stood with their fists raised. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/lLW8ZoYUUn — John Clark CSN (@JClarkCSN) September 20, 2016. Eagles defensive end Steven Means, safety Malcolm Jenkins, and cornerback Ron Brooks all raised their fists. The rest of the team and all the Bears players remained standing. These players should face serious consequences for their actions. Especially after a recent incident in Philadelphia where a black man attacked a female officer in her car, shooting her eight times. Though she survived thanks to her vest, he killed one person and injured five others before being arrested. This protest only adds to the tension between communities and law enforcement. These athletes live in the greatest country on Earth, earning millions while enjoying a life of comfort. Yet they turn their backs on America, its military, and the police who protect them. Obama has turned a colorblind society into a breeding ground for racial conflict. Now everything is about race, with groups like Black Lives",1
"When Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration until we understand the security risks, every liberal and progressive media outlet screamed that it was discriminatory. Oh how misguided they were, and still are. Racism is the belief that one group is superior based on their race, but Islam is a religion—not a race—and it has been exploited by extremists who carry out attacks in the name of their faith. These are the same people who claim to be going to heaven with 72 virgins after blowing themselves up in public spaces. The real extremism lies with those who ignore the threat. After seeing how global terrorism is evolving, Trump wanted to pause Muslim immigration until we can better secure our borders. Liberals believe the world will support their stance, but they're mistaken. In fact, a recent survey found that 47% of voters think the issue deserves national discussion, and two-thirds of Australians believe populist senator Pauline Hanson raises concerns that mainstream politicians avoid. The main reasons for supporting a ban were fears of terrorism and the belief that Muslim immigrants don’t assimilate or share national values. The poll was conducted in early August and then repeated to confirm the findings. So Australians want to protect their way of life? That’s what every nation strives for. Yet when Trump says “America first,” it's suddenly racist. That logic doesn’t hold. Sixty percent of right-wing supporters back an end to Muslim migration, along with 40% of Labor voters and 35% of Green voters. The pollster was shocked by the results, saying the “deplorables” he once dismissed as a small, fringe group are actually 48% of the population. He wrote: “This isn’t a group of outcasts outside society — this is nearly half the country.” While they’re more likely to vote for the Coalition or independent candidates, 40% of Labor voters and a third of Greens agree too. Look around — these are people you see every day, in your office, on the street, on the train. Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you should respond to those who disagree with you. Don’t label them “deplorables,” recognize that almost half the country is against you. Let’s fix this in November. (Source: Breitbart)",1
"Make no mistake: the ideological divide tearing America apart is more than just a political issue—it's a cultural one. We are a nation at odds with itself, split between the ""perpetrator"" and the ""victim."" Conservatives, Christians, and whites are increasingly painted as the enemy by a rising wave of radical ideology that fuels division to push a self-serving political agenda. The Black Lives Matter movement, according to prominent right-wing commentator Ann Coulter, has become a domestic extremist organization that spreads hostility toward law enforcement and white people, much like the KKK once targeted minorities. In a recent speech at a conservative conference, Coulter called for legal action against BLM, claiming it promotes hate under the guise of activism. “It’s not about supporting black lives—it’s about hating white people and police,” she said. Coulter acknowledged there are real issues in black communities but argued that BLM is not addressing them constructively. “A movement that incites violence and chaos only deepens the pain,” she claimed. She compared BLM to the KKK, suggesting that if the KKK was banned for promoting violence, then BLM should face similar consequences. While free speech protections make criminalizing such groups legally complex, Coulter insists it's time to hold these groups accountable for the unrest they provoke. After all, the KKK was dismantled when it was proven to be a violent, organized force—shouldn’t the same standard apply today?",1
"New Jersey’s controversial Republican Governor Chris Christie is facing intense scrutiny as top state lawmakers are considering launching an impeachment inquiry if he is proven to have masterminded the closure of the George Washington Bridge as retaliation against a political opponent. A judge has ordered Christie to release personal emails connected to the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, according to WNYC. The decision to move forward with impeachment will rest with Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, and if approved, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the formal process. A simple majority of the 80-member Assembly would be needed to approve articles of impeachment. If passed, the case would then go to the Senate, where a two-thirds vote would be required for conviction. While Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need at least three Republicans to join them in a conviction. Christie also serves as a key advisor on Donald Trump’s presidential transition team. Just days ago, federal prosecutors accused Christie of being deeply involved in the plot to shut down the bridge, which led to severe traffic chaos and delayed emergency services, resulting in one death. Christie had been seen as a strong conservative voice and was the first major Republican to endorse Trump, a move that many believed signaled the end of his political future unless he remained in Trump's favor. His abrupt shift from potential presidential contender to Trump’s loyal supporter, marked by a widely criticized endorsement event last March, was seen as a major political fall from grace. Christie once famously lied for over two hours during a televised press conference, which can be viewed below. The clip, set to 1:43, shows his outright denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate on January 9, 2014—just two months after re-election and four months after the incident that caused massive gridlock. The scandal left an entire region in disarray. Recently, it was revealed that Christie was actually informed about BridgeGate during a 9/11 memorial event in 2013 by his own aides, who later confronted him over his lies in internal communications. Once seen as a rising star in the Republican Party, Christie now faces the possibility of being removed from office due to his own dishonesty and aggressive political tactics. We'll continue to follow this developing story, especially how Trump responds to the impeachment threats against his New Jersey ally, as Christie remains a central figure in the GOP's presidential campaign. Watch his downfall:",1
"Caitlyn Jenner has been through a lot lately. She recently admitted to thinking about ending her life after a recent procedure. Caitlyn insists she's not gay, but she feels disconnected from both men and women. She's struggling with doubts about her transition and is reportedly regretting the surgery. Her TV show has been put on hold. What’s next for her? It seems the other side of the fence isn’t as green as she hoped. Caitlyn… whatever she is now.  

US Magazine Reports: “The 66-year-old I Am Cait star — once known as Bruce — shared with a close friend that she considered taking her own life following a facial contouring procedure, which she had always felt uncomfortable with. After a photo of her leaving the surgeon’s office in early 2015 surfaced, she was devastated. ‘I couldn’t sleep that night,’ she said. ‘I was pacing my house at 2 a.m., thinking, Oh no, this is going to be all over the news and it’s going to destroy me.’ She added, ‘I even thought, Maybe I should just go into the other room and end it all.’ The reality TV personality, who has spoken privately about her suicidal thoughts, described the moment as one of the most painful of her life.”  

It’s not uncommon. In a report by the UK Guardian, a study analyzing over 100 global medical papers found that up to 18% of trans individuals experience regret after transitioning, with no clear evidence that surgery significantly improves their quality of life. Many continue to struggle with mental health issues and suicidal tendencies. In fact, 39% of transgender people in the U.S. have attempted suicide at least once. And 58% of those who undergo cosmetic procedures later feel they made a mistake. It’s no surprise that Caitlyn is now feeling so lost.",1
"While presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton remain closely contested in national polls, the Republican nominee has continued to dominate in terms of event attendance and public enthusiasm. On Tuesday, Trump filled a large venue in Naples, Florida, with approximately 7,500 people inside and many more gathered outside, despite the hot 92-degree weather, as reported by the Naples Daily News. Meanwhile, on the same day in Detroit, Michigan, Clinton’s speech at Wayne State University drew fewer than 150 attendees, according to a report from the Detroit Free Press. The event was meant to connect with younger voters, a key demographic Clinton needs to secure victory in November, as noted by WXYZ-TV. However, images and accounts from the gathering suggested that the few millennials present were not particularly engaged. Fox News' Dana Perino shared a photo on social media capturing the mood of the Clinton event:

It's unclear whether the young man or the fire alarm was more enthusiastic about the speech. Trump has repeatedly highlighted the contrast between his well-attended rallies and Clinton's smaller crowds in recent weeks. “When Hillary comes in, it’s always a very small crowd,” he remarked. In contrast, Trump has consistently drawn massive crowds to his events across the country, a clear indicator of his strong grassroots support as the election approaches. On September 12, a Trump rally in Orlando attracted over 10,000 people, according to WFTV. The Naples event, with its 7,500 attendees, was also impressive when compared to Clinton’s recent appearance in Miami, which only drew around 1,200 people, as reported by the Miami Herald.

"I came across a local news segment discussing a store called “Second Chance Thrift.” It’s a network of second-hand shops that support the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. In addition to selling used clothing and furniture, they also provide free HIV and STD testing. That struck me as unusual. Why would a business associated with LGBTQ+ advocacy offer these medical services? What makes the sexual behavior of gay individuals so different that they require more frequent testing? I don’t need an HIV or STD test. Only people who engage in risky behaviors should be concerned. If a couple is married and only has sex with each other, they’re not at risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): “Rates of sexually transmitted infections have been rising among men who have sex with men, with significant increases in syphilis cases reported nationwide. In 2012, men who have sex with men made up 75% of new syphilis cases in the U.S. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with chlamydia and gonorrhea.” One might think the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s would have shown that same-sex relationships and shared drug use are dangerous. We were once told that anyone could contract AIDS. There's even an ad today that says exactly that. If that’s true, then every store should offer testing. But they don’t because it would be offensive to the majority who don’t engage in same-sex activity. Another sign that same-sex relationships are unnatural is the inability to naturally reproduce. Homosexual couples must rely on surrogacy or adoption. When moral values, scientific facts, and common sense clash with progressive views, governments often resort to coercion to enforce compliance.

"Clemson University freshmen may soon be prohibited from sharing Harambe-themed posters in their dorm rooms, as officials claim the images ""encourage sexual violence"" and ""promote harmful stereotypes."" The policy reportedly stems from an unspecified incident last month, though university leaders have not provided further details. A university official sent a memo to Resident Advisors (RAs) on Thursday, directing them to remove all Harambe-related decorations from common areas and private spaces. The memo stated that Harambe’s image has been ""misused to support rape culture"" and ""can be seen as a form of bigotry."" An RA confirmed that students who ignore the directive could face disciplinary action. ""Harambe references are no longer permitted in any public or semi-public space,"" the message read.

"Donald Trump has financial advisors who have crafted a strategy designed to boost economic growth. This stands in sharp contrast to the economic approach proposed by Hillary Clinton, which is seen as more statist in nature. The plan tackles current regulatory challenges, energy policy, and trade issues in a way that is expected to appeal to many voters. You can review the details for yourself. As reported by Fox News: Donald Trump’s economic strategy is projected to ""substantially boost America’s real GDP growth,"" according to a recent analysis by investor Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, a leading economist from the University of California. ""When considered as a unified framework, the Trump plan is fiscally responsible and does not add to the deficit,"" Ross and Navarro state in their report. Ross, a well-known figure in private equity, and Navarro, who serves as a top economic advisor to Trump’s campaign, argue that ""this plan will drive economic growth more effectively than Hillary Clinton’s agenda of tax increases, greater regulation, and restrictions on energy production."" In contrast, Clinton's plan ""calls for higher taxes, more government control, and tighter limits on fossil fuels, which would lead to higher energy costs,"" the report notes.

"Republican candidate Donald Trump has been walking a dangerous line for months, drawing suspicion across the country with a foreign policy that openly aligns with the interests of Vladimir Putin, the leader of the Russian Federation. He's surrounded himself with individuals closely linked to the Kremlin and the wealthy elites who pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s received open backing from Russian state media and intelligence agencies, who have hacked into Democratic Party systems and released select information to create division. Throughout it all, Trump has repeatedly denied any connection to Russia. “I have absolutely no investments in Russia,” he tweeted in July. Now—prepare yourself—it seems he’s been hiding the truth all along. A report by *CNN* has uncovered that Donald Trump has “extensive connections” to Russian interests both in the U.S. and in Russia. “The amount of business he’s done with Russian figures is in the hundreds of millions — what he gained from working with Russian businessmen. They were eager to invest with him, and they were eager to work with Donald Trump. And they were eager to be associated with him,” says Sergei Millian, head of a U.S.-Russia business association. Trump has made significant profits through deals with Russian billionaires, including hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers — so many that parts of Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” These Russian tycoons built their fortunes by acquiring massive shares in state-owned companies during the transition to a market economy, becoming overnight millionaires. By the end of Yeltsin’s time in power, they controlled between 50% and 75% of the country’s financial sector. Today, they use their influence and wealth to support the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye to their exploitation of the nation. Putin himself is estimated to have a fortune of $70 billion, possibly even more. The oligarchs are always seeking ways to move their illicit money out of the country, and purchasing Trump properties has become a popular method. It’s no surprise — they’re all cut from the same mold. They are self-centered, money-driven individuals who care only about increasing their own wealth. “For them, material wealth is a deeply emotional and spiritual pursuit. They spend huge sums on personal indulgence…They don’t read books. They don’t attend art events. They think the only way to impress others is to buy a yacht,”",1
"This is truly inspiring. This is how it should be. No interference from authorities, no pressure on individuals to act against their beliefs, just people expressing their opinions on the NFL’s national anthem protests. I’m not a huge fan of sports, but I know a few who are. They live for their teams, wear their colors proudly, and take every game very seriously. Some have even stopped supporting the NFL altogether. Their loyalty to their team isn’t enough to overlook the disrespect they feel toward the country they love, especially from those who’ve benefited from our freedom. SANTA CLARA, CA – SEPTEMBER 12: Colin Kaepernick #7 of the San Francisco 49ers kneels in protest during the National Anthem prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams in their NFL game at Levi’s Stadium on September 12th, 2016 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images) Mark Thompson isn’t alone in his stance, but he’s a clear representation of what many Americans are experiencing right now. A lifelong Sports Illustrated reader, Mark watches NFL games to escape the constant political debates that dominate other media. However, with more athletes taking a stand during the national anthem, he feels politics has invaded his favorite pastime. So he’s stepping back. “I want to tell these players, ‘If you weren’t in the NFL, you’d probably be flipping burgers. People are fed up,” said Thompson, a resident of Grand Rapids, Mich. Fans don’t tune in for vague political messages—they watch to see their favorite players shine, giving them something to talk about until the next game. If they wanted politics, they’d watch the news. What happens when a popular sport like football becomes linked with something as controversial as politics? According to ESPN, the opening game of the season saw a 12% drop in viewership compared to last year. That’s the lowest number of live viewers in the past eight years.

"Let’s just put it this way: If Donald Trump’s team was caught doing something like this, the media would be all over it, screaming about corruption and demanding his resignation. But with Hillary Clinton, it seems like everything is somehow excusable. Not sure what I mean? Let me explain. The group VoteForHillary, a volunteer organization supporting Clinton’s campaign, was caught training voters to spread misinformation at polling stations. Two major issues here: First, it's illegal to approach voters at polling places and influence their choices. That’s why candidates are usually kept away from those areas—except when Bill Clinton did it, and the press stayed silent. This looks like a textbook case of voter interference. Second, the people running VoteForHillary had no idea that one of their volunteers was secretly recording the whole thing, catching them in the act. Here’s the full video.

"Americanism vs. Globalism – Democrats claim we’re fighting a battle of ideas against extremists who are distorting Islam, while Republicans argue this is an actual war against violent enemies who kill anyone who stands in their way. The real conflict, many say, is happening within America itself, as external threats work to undermine the nation from the outside. Trump and Biden now represent the two opposing sides, each offering a different vision for the country’s future. To the Right, America is being taken over by immigrants who refuse to adopt American values, instead pushing their own culture onto the nation and corrupting its institutions with the help of liberal elites. To the Left, America is a land of bigots and exploiters who have built an empire on the backs of other nations, fearing change and resisting global cooperation. They argue that the real problem is religious fundamentalists—particularly Christians—who block progress and peace by opposing secular values and the inclusive message of Islam. Terrorists carrying out attacks are labeled as Islamist radicals, but some on the left insist they are actually atheists trying to provoke religious conflict by tricking Christians into attacking innocent Muslims.

"How can you tell when a candidate is clearly not in control of his mental state and is unfit to engage in a high-stakes debate? While experts may disagree, there are clear red flags. Joe Biden has been campaigning nonstop for weeks, constantly under the spotlight, with little time to rest. He's an 80-year-old man who refuses to slow down. Recently, he was preparing for a major policy speech, yet instead of taking a break, he abruptly canceled his schedule and flew to Buffalo for a last-minute rally. It’s becoming more obvious that he’s struggling to keep up. On Friday, just hours before his planned appearance, Biden released a confusing post that jumped between three completely unrelated topics. It suggests his mind is losing focus, and while each subject could be used to appeal to different voter groups, together they make no sense: A mass shooting in Colorado by a foreign national. A surge in violent crimes in Detroit. And a protest in Georgia. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 12, 2024. What does it all mean? If you're trying to scare voters, you talk about crime. If you're trying to connect with working-class families, you talk about economic anxiety. If you want to stir up anger, you talk about protests. Bringing them all together shows one thing: Biden is unraveling. He’s not ready for the debate and may not be fit to lead. This could mark the beginning of the end for his campaign.

"After collapsing just before stepping into her car following her exit from the 9-11 memorial event in Washington D.C., Hillary Clinton was seen later at her son’s residence, looking completely transformed. The change was so drastic that it raised serious questions—she appeared healthier, more alert, and significantly thinner. What made it even more suspicious was the noticeable difference in her facial features, particularly her nose. The version of Hillary seen at the residence had a nose that was slightly curved at the tip, with a subtle bump on the bridge, resembling a more European or Roman style, unlike the straight, Nordic-shaped nose she has been known for throughout her career. 

In addition to the altered nose, the woman at the residence looked younger, with less visible signs of aging and no sign of her usual cough or hoarseness. She also lacked the small mole above her upper lip that is clearly visible in all official photos of the real Hillary Clinton. Given her reported health struggles that have limited her public appearances, many are questioning whether this is a real Hillary or a stand-in. If this trend continues, it's possible that the clone could take over most of her scheduled events, including debates with Donald Trump.

The key indicator to watch for is her appearance. If she looks unusually slim, youthful, or shows no signs of her usual ailments, it may not be the real Hillary. If she appears normal, then it's likely the clone. The big question remains: will the real Hillary Clinton ever step forward as President, or will her double handle all major public engagements, including the State of the Union and international meetings? If she wins the election, it could be her stand-in who takes the oath of office, leaving the real Hillary Clinton out of the entire administration. This would mark a historic shift, where the president is merely a figurehead, with all decisions made by others behind the scenes. The implications are staggering, and the American public may soon be facing a new kind of political mystery.

"Sheriff Parnell McNamara For the majority of average citizens, it wasn’t that long ago when hearing the phrase “all lives matter” was seen as a unifying and positive statement, one that embraced everyone regardless of race, gender, or background. But in recent years, this once innocent phrase has been twisted by the politically correct elite, who have redefined its meaning to fit their own agenda. It’s no surprise that progressive activists and identity politics advocates have taken it upon themselves to reshape common language, often with the intent of shifting public perception. And that’s where Sheriff Parnell McNamara of McLennan County now finds himself. It appears he hasn’t kept up with the evolving narrative around sensitive topics, and now faces backlash for his actions. His mistake? Running a full-page ad in the Hometown News with the message “All Lives Matter,” which has sparked outrage from the usual critics. McNamara explained that he placed the ad because he believes in the statement, saying, “I remember someone telling me that ‘All Lives Matter’ is a racial slur, but that’s not true. Everyone’s life matters—yours, mine, police officers, and everyday people. It doesn’t matter what color you are. Every person deserves to live.” Most Americans would likely agree, but within the current political climate, expressing that belief is now seen as offensive by some. Jo Welter, chairman of the Community Race Relations Coalition, argued that “All Lives Matter” overlooks systemic issues, stating, “Throughout history and even today, black lives aren’t valued equally.” He then selectively used data to support his claim. Meanwhile, State Rep. Charles “Doc” Anderson criticized the movement, calling it divisive and harmful. “It doesn’t address real issues. It’s inflammatory and designed to cause conflict,” he said. “Most black people understand that all lives matter.” Sheriff McNamara added, “No officer shows up wanting to hurt anyone. There have been black officers killed in the line of duty. This movement against police is wrong.” Sgt. Lionel McGee, a Black officer in the sheriff’s office, echoed this sentiment, noting that not all BLM supporters back law enforcement. “Some people in the movement will never support cops,” he said. “I’ve had this conversation with my own sister about the Michael Brown case. I probably would have done the same thing. The incident with Eric Garner—he could have just gone to jail instead",1
"A key figure in Trump's campaign in Cuyahoga County, Ohio—a pivotal area in the state—made a statement that has sparked widespread outrage. She claimed that racial discrimination only began after Obama took office, calling it the most outlandish remark of the season. While it's easy to dismiss her claim as nonsense, we'll take a closer look at why it's not only false but deeply harmful. In an interview with a local news outlet, Sarah Thompson, the county's campaign director, said: “There was no racism before Obama. We didn’t have these issues back then.” It seems she’s suggesting that white people were somehow unaware of the deep-rooted nature of racism in their own culture. This is, of course, completely untrue. She continued with a series of damaging remarks about the Black community, ignoring the systemic challenges they face daily: “If you're Black and haven't succeeded in the last 50 years, it's your fault. You had the same opportunities, the same schools, and even extra help to go to college that white kids didn’t get. You just didn’t make the most of it.” *Disgusting*. For someone who clearly doesn’t understand history, let’s explain why this is not only wrong but offensive. She even insisted that racism wasn’t an issue during her childhood in the 1970s. What? Segregation, Jim Crow, and ongoing discrimination? Black people have faced a justice system that disproportionately targets them, breaking up families and limiting future opportunities. Many attend underfunded schools dominated by white administrators who still carry the legacy of racism. Black people were stripped of their freedom and wealth for generations, and the effects of that oppression are still felt today. Yes, things have improved, but that doesn’t erase the structural inequalities that continue to affect Black communities. Because of historical injustice, many Black families live in poverty, which often leads to lower educational outcomes. College costs are also a major barrier. Black students are more likely to be disciplined harshly in school, which hurts their chances of success. I could keep going, and I’m not even Black. This person is living in a fantasy world, and their views pose a real threat to our society. And all of this, according to her, is Obama’s fault.

"What’s happening with the NFL? Where did the excitement go? The viewership has been on a downward spiral lately, but it hasn’t reached a crisis point…yet. However, there are whispers that 44% of fans might actually stop watching if the league doesn’t address the growing anti-police sentiment. This isn’t just talk—some say it’s becoming a real threat. Fans are upset over players like Colin Kaepernick and others who protest racial injustice by kneeling during the National Anthem or raising their fists, often without understanding the deeper meaning behind these actions. If this trend continues, it could really hurt the league.  

A recent online survey suggests that 44% of fans would follow through with their boycott. Of course, it's an internet poll, so take it with a grain of salt—but still, it’s worth noting. Some fans claim they stopped watching after the absence of Brady and Peyton, while many others blamed the protests as a major factor in their decision. With more unrest following recent police incidents, it seems unlikely that the kneeling will stop soon.  

But how long can this last? What’s the real goal here? Is it just a reaction to police violence, or is there something more at play? Whatever the case, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will have to act. Will he crack down on players for disrespecting the flag, or will he cave to political correctness? I’m leaning toward the latter.",1
"Former President George H.W. Bush is breaking with his party's presidential candidate and has decided to support Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election, according to a member of another prominent political family, the Kennedys. At 92, Bush had planned to remain neutral in the contest between Clinton and Donald Trump, a quiet indication of his discomfort with the GOP nominee. However, his preference for the wife of his predecessor, President Bill Clinton, was revealed through Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy.  

The story broke when Townsend posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her shaking hands with the former president, accompanied by the caption: ""The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!"" In a recent phone call, Townsend said she met with Bush in Maine and that he confirmed his intention to vote for a Democratic candidate. “That’s what he said,” she told The New York Times.  

When asked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush’s spokesperson, Jim McGrath, responded via email: “President Bush will cast his vote as a private citizen in about 50 days, and he will not be commenting on the presidential race until then.”  

The Bush family has largely remained out of the current political spotlight after supporting their son Jeb’s failed presidential campaign earlier this year. Neither George H.W. Bush nor his son, George W. Bush, attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Trump was officially nominated.  

Several former GOP figures from both Bush administrations have also expressed support for Clinton over Trump, including national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. However, former Vice President Dan Quayle has continued to back Trump, telling POLITICO earlier this year that he still hopes both Bushes would eventually endorse the Republican candidate. “I hope they’ll come around, but they can speak for themselves,” he said in an interview.",1
"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah’s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has confessed to supporting the Communist Party during the 1976 election. At last week’s Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference, Brennan revealed that during his initial polygraph interview for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980, he was asked if he had ever worked with or supported a group seeking to overthrow the U.S. government. “I froze,” Brennan admitted. “I thought back to an earlier election where I cast my vote for the Communist Party candidate.” He claimed he believed the First Amendment protected his right to express himself, so he chose to be honest. “We all make mistakes,” he said. “If that were disqualifying, I wouldn’t be standing here.” Brennan described the moment as a tough choice: “I could lie and risk being seen as unstable, or tell the truth and see what happened.” The question stemmed from the 1940 Smith Act, which prohibited advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The standard question is, “Have you EVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?” “I wasn’t affiliated with the Democratic or Republican Party, but I was trying to show my dissatisfaction with the system and the need for change,” Brennan explained. “I wasn’t a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher just nodded and said, ‘OK.’ Afterward, I thought, ‘Well, I’m done.’” Brennan then attempted to downplay concerns about civil liberties, saying, “If in 1980, John Brennan could say he voted for the Communist Party candidate and still get into the CIA, then your freedom of speech and expression won’t disqualify you from a career in government.” It’s curious that Brennan would say this, given that the CIA previously suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding Benghazi, blocked survivors from testifying to Congress, and is known for being authoritarian. He also reportedly refused to take his oath on a Bible, opting instead for a Constitution without the Bill of Rights—after receiving the most negative votes for confirmation in history. Between 1950 and 1957, many Communist Party members faced legal consequences for their beliefs. According to Wikipedia, after a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan, eleven Communist Party leaders were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949",1
"There’s a lot to unpack from last night’s debate, like the moderator’s obvious bias toward Hillary, but that’s not what people are buzzing about right now. What has everyone confused is the fact that Hillary didn’t cough once! She was sharp, articulate, and clearly prepared with solid responses. Even more surprising, she didn’t reach for a glass of water or seem to struggle at all. This strange behavior has sparked plenty of conversation online. Some are pointing to photos that show Hillary with what looks like a small, flesh-colored object near her ear—could it be an earpiece? Or just a stylish accessory for someone her age? Social media is already speculating. Could it be a hearing aid? A hidden microphone? Or maybe something more mysterious?  

Clinton’s team is quickly dismissing the claims, with a spokesperson stating that what’s seen in the image is likely a reflection from the studio lights. But some aren’t convinced. An email released by WikiLeaks between Clinton and Huma Abedin reads, “Did you bring the earpiece or should I?” The tone suggests there’s more going on than meets the eye. One anonymous source even joked, “She can’t even lie without help from a group of liars through that thing.” Others have speculated that it’s just a trick of the light or a simple piece of jewelry. While no one has ever mentioned Hillary using an earpiece before, especially during her more shaky moments, the mystery remains unsolved. What do you think? Is it a device, a reflection, or just a clever disguise?",1
"Obama delivered a shocking and defeatist speech during his last major address to the U.N. General Assembly, where he openly admitted that the U.S. has no realistic chance of defeating ISIS and other extremist groups in Syria. He criticized the limitations of military force, referring to the fight against these groups as a ""JV team"" challenge. As the world's leading superpower, Obama claimed that military action alone cannot resolve the conflict. The Daily Caller reported that he emphasized the rapid expansion of ISIS and the growing number of militants, which he said makes a military solution unattainable. ""If we're honest, we have to recognize that no outside force can compel different religious or ethnic groups to live together peacefully for long,"" Obama stated. He urged the international community to focus on diplomacy, aid, and political solutions rather than military intervention. ""We must support those who seek peace and understand that people who look different from us are still deserving of respect,"" he added. However, many critics argue that this approach ignores the real threat posed by radical Islam. This is the same mindset that downplays the connection between Islamic extremism and violence, similar to how some liberals criticize a Christian student wanting to say the Pledge of Allegiance while being quick to defend suspected Muslim terrorists. This kind of thinking has led to inaction and increased danger. It's time to stop pretending there's no threat and start taking real steps to protect our country. If we don't act now, Obama’s pessimistic speech may soon become our reality. Share this if you believe it's time to confront the real threat of radical Islam. Source: Conservative Tribune

"Voters are demanding answers about Hillary Clinton and her e-mails, and the controversy isn’t fading away… partly because officials are working hard to shield her and prevent any legal consequences. They’re stalling the process and blocking access to her messages. Their goal is to ensure that the public doesn’t see the e-mails before the election… and thanks to a recent court decision, they’ve succeeded. A federal judge has ordered that her e-mails remain confidential until after the voting takes place. The FBI uncovered several e-mails during their probe into her private server, but most will stay under wraps for now. Judicial Watch’s Tom Fitton is accusing the Obama administration of orchestrating the delay, calling it a deeply flawed system. “This is a completely unethical approach by the State Department,” he claimed. What could be in those e-mails that has so many within the Obama administration scrambling to keep them hidden? There must be something highly damaging and explosive that could derail her campaign. And since Obama has already endorsed her as his successor, it’s clear he won’t let her fall now.  
Hillary Clinton is widely seen as one of the most untrustworthy politicians in the country. But what’s truly alarming is her apparent ability to manipulate both the FBI and the Justice Department to avoid any real accountability, along with numerous federal judges. At this point, why pretend she’s subject to the same rules as everyone else? And to make matters worse, there are still voters who support her—hoping she’ll become president and gain even more power. How much more corruption and criminal behavior does it take before these people realize how dangerous she really is?",1
"This is one that will make you proud that protectors and watchdogs don’t care about the color of someone’s skin. A playground confrontation was captured on video, but it takes a shocking turn that defies expectations from the very beginning. One moment will leave you questioning the motives of two aggressors, while another will show that radical groups like BlackLivesMatter and the League of Young Voters aren’t as powerful as the left-leaning media suggests. You’ll see how skin color doesn’t determine loyalty, as these so-called hate groups would have you believe. The footage starts with a white male student sitting alone on a park bench, scrolling through his phone, when suddenly two black students rush him from behind. The first hit lands directly on his face, sending him to the ground in a defensive crouch. The attackers keep striking, throwing punches wherever they can land. It looks like the victim is in real trouble… until two students, one boy and one girl, step in to stop the assault and defend the helpless kid. And here's the twist—both of them are black.  
It shouldn't come as a surprise to most Americans that these two individuals chose to help a white peer. Skin color doesn’t define character, and if you don’t believe that, you’re either a modern-day bigot or someone stuck in outdated thinking. That’s not what this country stands for. These two watchdogs didn’t care about the color of the skin—they saw a person being attacked and they acted. They truly are heroes.",1
"Next week’s debate could be the most-watched Presidential showdown in DECADES. That is, if both candidates actually show up. Conservative blogger and Right Wing News founder Mike Cernovich recently shared a report claiming that an anonymous ""political insider"" told him that Donald Trump might be skipping Monday’s debate. According to this source, a trusted conservative figure contacted Cernovich early Wednesday with news that Trump could be pulling out of the scheduled event. Some are saying that Trump may be trying to avoid a damaging performance, while others believe this is just another attempt to generate buzz for the highly anticipated clash between the Republican and Democratic nominees. With recent speculation about the former president's health, some are wondering if he might face a last-minute ""medical issue"" before taking the stage. Is this a real possibility, or just a tactic to keep the public engaged? What do you think about the credibility of these claims?",1
"What in the world just happened? I'm speechless… There's no way to explain what I just saw without you watching it for yourself… so here it is. WARNING: This video might make you want to throw something. Don’t. Two words came to mind while I was watching… Crazy liberal. I don’t say that as an insult, just a description… Those liberals sure love their free speech, don’t they? She ranted and raged about her rights the whole time. The issue is, they only care when they agree with you. Otherwise, you're a racist, sexist, bigot, or throw in any “phobe” you like. I’m ashamed she’s a woman; it doesn’t reflect well on anyone. She’s the perfect example of what’s wrong with this country. She calls the guy a redneck, doesn’t like his yard, then flips him off. And then acts like she’s the victim? That woman needs to take a chill pill. The real victim is Mike… poor, poor Mike. The kid’s in trouble. Then there’s our cops—this is the nonsense they deal with daily. If I were the guy she flipped off, knowing she’ll have to pass by every day… I’d put up a sign that said… Sarah: 0 Redneck: 1 I’d pay to see the video she makes after seeing that. I really hate these so-called activists, they give me a headache. Rude.",1
"How can you tell when a candidate is so exhausted and out of touch that they’re clearly not ready to face the public for an hour? While opinions may vary, there are definite red flags. Joe Biden has been campaigning nonstop for weeks, constantly under the spotlight, with little time to recharge. At 80 years old, he shows no signs of slowing down. He’s not only preparing for a high-stakes debate with a seasoned leader (regardless of his denials, he knows the truth) but instead of taking a break, he suddenly flies to Youngstown to hold a rally. It’s starting to show. On Friday night, just hours before he’s set to step onto the stage for what could be the most critical moment of his campaign, Joe Biden is displaying signs that he’s pushing himself beyond his limits. His latest social media post is all over the place—jumping from one unrelated topic to another. This incoherent message suggests his mind is unfocused, and while each subject might have once been a key issue to appeal to different groups, together they make no sense: A mass shooting in Texas by a foreign national. A surge in violent crime across the Midwest. And a protest in Pennsylvania! — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 1, 2020. What on earth is he trying to say? If you want to appeal to voters who fear violence, you talk about crime. If you want to connect with those worried about rising violence in their communities, you address it directly. If you're trying to win over younger voters, you focus on protests and social issues. Bringing them all together shows one thing: Biden is losing his grip. He’s clearly not prepared for the debate and may not be fit to lead. This could be the beginning of the end for the Biden campaign. Featured image from file.",1
"Viewers of tonight’s debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump who decide to drink every time Biden makes an exaggerated claim could potentially face severe health risks, according to the US Surgeon General. Following the chaotic exchanges of the 2016 debates, there was a noticeable spike in alcohol-related emergency room visits, with over 60,000 additional cases reported in the following week. Given the frequent overstatements from Biden during his campaign, medical officials are warning of a possible surge in alcohol poisoning incidents tonight. According to The New York Times, Biden made at least one misleading statement every four minutes during a recent five-day stretch. Similar concerns were raised last year before the Democratic primary debates, when emergency services saw a rise in alcohol-related calls. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy stated, “We are preparing for an alarming increase in alcohol poisoning across the country as people participate in drinking games during the debate. The risk is especially high when watching political debates filled with unverified claims.” With the current candidates, the likelihood of exaggerated statements has never been higher. The Mayo Clinic warns that symptoms of alcohol poisoning include slurred speech, loss of coordination, unconsciousness, slow or irregular breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Please stay informed and make responsible choices while watching the debate.",1
"In another explosive leak from WikiLeaks, more damning details have come to light! Hillary Clinton has received donations from the CEO of a major corporation that has also been linked to ISIS…this is just another example of how this corrupt leader continues to sink lower! The company in question is the French conglomerate Lafarge, which has donated over $100,000 to her campaigns. What’s even more disturbing is that the City of Paris has partnered with this same company, despite evidence showing their ties to the Islamic State.  

TheCanary.Co uncovered this shocking connection: Internal documents from multiple investigative reports show that Lafarge paid taxes to ISIS to run its cement plant in Syria and even purchased oil from the group for years. Despite this, the company remains a key supplier for the City of Paris’s summer beach project, Paris-Plages, organized by Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Lafarge also has a long history of association with Hillary Clinton. Not only has it contributed heavily to the Clinton Foundation, but Clinton was once a legal advisor for the company in the 1980s and served on its board in the early 1990s.  

During her time with Lafarge, the company was involved in a covert operation that helped the CIA ship arms to Saddam Hussein. The report also states that Lafarge’s Paris office was aware of its dealings with ISIS, including the sale of cement and oil. This isn’t just business — it’s direct support. You can’t be neutral when dealing with terrorists. If you’re involved, you’re complicit. Hillary Clinton has taken over $100,000 from a company that supports ISIS — the same group that wants to destroy our way of life. She's not just careless, she's dangerous. And unfortunately, it seems the rules don’t apply to her…just like they didn’t apply to Hitler.",1
"Guess who George H.W. Bush is supporting this election? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son, George W. Bush, also served as president. Yet it appears that the former president is so unimpressed with Donald Trump that he's actually planning to vote for Hillary Clinton. According to sources close to the former president, Bush had initially intended to stay out of the public conversation about this election. As a lifelong Republican, his decision to support a Democratic candidate is quite surprising. However, it wasn’t Bush himself who made the revelation. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the late Robert Kennedy, who shared the news on her social media: “On Monday, Townsend posted a photo on Facebook of herself shaking hands with the former president, captioning it: ‘The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!’” She later confirmed the statement when speaking to reporters. According to Townsend, George H.W. Bush would rather back his old opponent’s wife than the controversial figure that is Donald Trump. A representative for the Bush family declined to confirm the claim, stating that the former president’s choice remains private. While Bush hasn’t spoken publicly, some of those close to him have been more open, according to Townsend. Earlier this year, Bush made it clear he had no intention of endorsing Trump, calling it a bold move for a Republican, given that Trump’s policies and rhetoric clash with traditional conservative values. His admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin further fuels concerns about his alignment with autocratic tendencies. This isn’t the first time a prominent Republican has distanced themselves from Trump — earlier this summer, a former aide to George W. Bush announced she would be voting for Hillary Clinton. Jeb Bush has also expressed difficulty supporting either major candidate. A former Republican president choosing not to back the party’s nominee is a significant and unexpected shift.",1
"In the past two decades, we've seen both Republican and Democratic leaders in the White House. While lawmakers from both parties often clash on many issues, they share a common stance: that American markets should be overwhelmed with foreign goods, that domestic manufacturing should decline, and that American workers should be replaced. It's increasingly difficult to find products made in the U.S. When you walk into a store, it's clear—Chinese-made items dominate the shelves. Amazing how these politicians seem to know what's best for us. They've done the thinking for the public, deciding that this is the way forward. It looks like American voters don’t really have a voice. No matter who you vote for, let the political factions fight among themselves, and let the public support their chosen side. But what do these leaders tell voters about the trade policies they pass? Why are these deals kept secret until after the votes are cast? Why is it that the public only learns about these agreements after they’ve been approved? Did they even ask voters if these trade deals should be signed? Did they seek input on whether they should be changed or canceled? The corporate elite are focused on maximizing profits, even if it means sacrificing American jobs, and free trade pacts have become their guiding principles.

"A Muslim Somali asylum seeker named Ahmed, who lives in Umeå, Sweden, has been labeled a criminal by local authorities. Ahmed is known to the police for a string of violent offenses, including assault and sexual misconduct. This dangerous individual has been receiving social welfare while committing crimes since arriving in Sweden three years ago. His latest incident was not against a stranger but his own wife. After spending the evening out with friends, he returned home to find his wife had not followed his orders to send away her niece, whom she was babysitting. Knowing his history of abuse, she had no choice but to obey. When he discovered the niece was still there, he claimed his ""Islamic right"" to discipline his pregnant wife for her disobedience. He dragged her to the floor and beat her in the head and stomach. To add insult to injury, he poured beer over her, which is odd because Muslims are supposed to avoid alcohol. I wonder how it ended up in the house in the first place. He then finished his act by pulling down his pants and urinating all over her. Thanks, Mohammad, for teaching men how to treat a ""disobedient"" woman — especially when she's carrying your child. Quran 4:34 states that righteous women should be obedient, guarding what Allah has entrusted them with. For those who show arrogance, the text says to advise them, then separate from them, and finally strike them. But if they return to obedience, you must not seek harm. It’s strange how this man drinks alcohol and leaves his wife alone at night, yet feels entitled to beat her. The Quran says to beat them with a light stick, but clearly, this man skipped mosque too many times or is following a different version of the holy book. It seems some are creating their own rules of terror for Muslims to follow.",1
"Hillary continues to face one awkward moment after another these days. Her most recent gaffe occurred at a campaign event when a man shouted, “Hillary for jail!” In response, Hillary said, “Let’s make it happen!” Surprisingly, the whole country seems to agree with her on this one. But I’m sure she was confused (again) and didn’t actually mean it. It’s likely she misheard the crowd and thought the person said, “Hillary for president!” Hilarious and sad all at once. Not to be left out, Elizabeth Warren also fell for a prank when she took a photo with someone she believed was a Hillary supporter—only to be told, “You lied about your heritage!” The young man also claimed Hillary would lose to Trump, which led to an uncomfortable exchange. It only made things worse for Warren. Extremely awkward and embarrassing. (Photo: Reuters) From InfoWars: Hillary Clinton was caught in a mortifying moment when a protester at her rally yelled, “Hillary for jail!” and she replied, “Let’s make it happen!” The incident was recorded and quickly went viral. With her history of seeming confused, it's possible she misunderstood the message and thought the crowd was chanting “Hillary for president.” The “Hillary for jail” meme has been circulating for a while now, fueled by public frustration over her lack of accountability for past scandals. This phrase has become a popular slogan among Trump supporters, who view Hillary as the most corrupt candidate in recent memory. Since the Republican convention, the phrase has spread beyond just Trump backers, even gaining traction among some independents. Clinton’s allies admit she’s deeply involved in questionable dealings. With ongoing investigations and reports of declining health, Trump is now pulling ahead in the polls. As terrorism threats rise and law enforcement shows support for Trump, his lead is expected to grow. Clinton appears weak, damaged, and unfit for leadership. If the nation faces more attacks, people may turn to a strong leader like Trump and beg for his guidance. Lord help us. America is shifting, and not in a good way.

"Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed “law and order” candidate, painted a grim portrayal of life in America’s “inner cities.” “We have inner cities where African-Americans and Hispanics are living in constant danger—this is a crisis,” he stated earlier this week. He praised former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy as a way to reduce crime in urban areas. However, his claims were quickly challenged by data and officials from his own city. The NYPD’s Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information, J. Peter Donald, directly refuted Trump’s misleading statements during a recent debate. He criticized the Republican nominee for spreading falsehoods and suggesting that the NYPD isn’t capable of maintaining public safety. Trump, according to Donald, is trying to appear tough on crime, but his proposals are really just coded appeals to white nationalist supporters. The “stop-and-frisk” program was not only ineffective, but it also disproportionately targeted minorities. After its suspension in 2011 under Mayor Bloomberg, crime rates actually dropped. Trump is promoting a dystopian image of America that doesn’t reflect reality—and the police officers he’s trying to win over aren’t fooled.",1
"A Donald Trump supporter visited the Barack Obama campaign office in Michigan to check out the atmosphere, but what he found was completely unexpected. The place was eerily quiet, with hardly anyone around. The office, which was supposed to be buzzing with volunteers helping the former president’s re-election effort, looked more like a ghost town. In fact, the only people present were the staff members, and it left many wondering if they were even real volunteers or just paid actors. When the man introduced himself as a Trump supporter and asked where all the grassroots workers were, the staff barely responded before escorting him out. #Trump supporter visits Obama's Michigan office, finds NO VOLUNTEERS. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/8gq5Xy9JdF — Sarah Mitchell 🇺🇸 (@SarahMitchell) October 5, 2012. Does Obama really have no support from his own base? It seems that way! This isn’t surprising, considering Obama had to pay people to attend his convention just a few weeks back. How fascinating, this video clearly shows how little public backing this leader actually has. The staff seemed relieved that someone showed up, too bad it wasn’t one of their own! Brilliant.",1
"Through the course of this election cycle, a shadow has loomed over Trump’s campaign – not just one shadow, but several. Racist, bigoted, and misleading ones. But the one that’s grabbing attention is “why hasn’t Trump released his tax returns?” The answer, as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that he hasn’t paid any federal income tax in years. Trump accused Clinton of wasting taxpayer money, claiming it could have been used for vital infrastructure projects — the kind Republicans like Trump usually oppose. Clinton seized the moment to take a jab at the GOP candidate’s financial history. “Maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax in a long time,” she said, skillfully setting the trap. And Trump didn’t take long to fall into it. In an attempt to counter her, he accidentally confirmed her claim: “It would be wasted too, believe me.” Note the word “would.” If Trump had actually paid taxes, he wouldn’t have used that phrasing, especially after calling taxes “smart” earlier in the debate. Could this be why he’s resisting disclosure, claiming he’ll only release them “against his lawyer’s advice” if Clinton releases her deleted emails? Is Trump trying to hide the fact that he’s a tax avoider who doesn’t contribute his fair share? When Trump says “believe me,” take it to heart — not about the money being “wasted,” but about his own belief that it “would” be if he had paid. Watch the clip below:

"This is a true story. General Stanley McChrystal served as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan and often clashed with his political leadership over strategy. One day, he was summoned to the Oval Office, sensing his military career might be ending. When President Barack Obama called him in, McChrystal knew the meeting wouldn’t end well. Obama accused him of not backing him politically. “Sir, my duty is to support you as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician,” McChrystal said, then handed in his resignation.  
Barack Obama has long been seen as unfriendly toward the military. He rarely lets people have the last word, but this time he didn’t get the final say. After accepting McChrystal’s resignation, the president made a sharp comment: “I bet when I’m gone, you’ll be glad to pee on my grave.” The general saluted and replied, “Mr. President, I always vowed I’d never stand in line again after leaving the Army. Good job, General McChrystal. I’m sure after a few years, the line will be shorter, and you won’t have to wait. You’re an honorable man — I know you’d never cut in front of others.”",1
"Scene number one – Cairo, Egypt: I am packing my suitcase. Finally, I’m about to make my dream come true. I’m heading to a country that values knowledge and respects its scholars. I’m ready to step into the modern world. Scene number two – Los Angeles, America: I feel nervous. This is my first time stepping on American soil. I’m excited, but also anxious. It’s a new chapter, and I’m full of hope, yet I can’t shake the fear. What if this is all just a fantasy? Scene number three – Chicago, Illinois: I’m not dreaming — it’s real. I’m in an American classroom for the first time. I pinched myself to confirm I was awake. Scene number four – a few weeks after arriving: I had a terrible nightmare. I walked out of the lecture hall and saw all the professors, staff, and students lined up. At the front, there was a TV in the dean’s office. A major incident had taken place. I prayed it was just a dream. But it wasn’t. It was real. Scene number five – I stood in line, heart pounding: What if they were from my country? Please, God, don’t let them be Muslims. The news broke — they were Muslims, and worse, the leader was from my homeland. I was stunned. I covered my face in shame and tried to walk away. An American professor placed a hand on my shoulder, offering comfort. A young student whispered: “Be careful. Some people might act out of fear.” I didn’t have a car, but a stranger offered to drive me home. I came here to study and build a future. Later, I realized the greatest benefit was being surrounded by open-minded people. Scene number six – many weeks later, I was at the airport: Every time I tried to board, I was randomly selected for a full body search. This time, after being checked thoroughly, I was about to step onto the plane with my carry-on when a security officer said: “Sir, you can’t bring that bag on board.” I shouted, “I have the right to carry this!” He repeated, almost pleading: “Please, you can’t have that bag.” His fear silenced me. I handed it over. I whispered, “What’s a little harassment compared to what others have sacrificed for this country?” The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are",1
"Reince Priebus openly warned Kasich and other Republican figures that they must fully back Donald Trump or risk losing their political futures. John Kasich, however, remains unmoved by Priebus’s intimidation tactics. During a recent interview, the GOP chair suggested that Republicans who refuse to align with Trump could face serious consequences in future elections. “Those people need to get on board,” Priebus said, “and if they’re thinking about running again, I think we’ll look at the nomination process and it won’t be easy for them. In South Carolina, you have to commit to the nominee, no matter who they are. The question is, what’s the penalty? It’s not a threat, but we have a process in place.” Kasich has consistently refused to endorse Trump and has strongly criticized Priebus’s approach. His campaign spokesperson, John Weaver, responded sharply, stating, “There are still leaders who prioritize principle over party loyalty. While some in the party may see politics as a game, Governor Kasich is focused on the bigger picture. He’s working across the country to help down-ballot Republicans avoid a major loss under Priebus’s leadership.” Weaver also suggested that Priebus should be grateful to Kasich. As Kasich looks toward future elections, it will be interesting to see whether Priebus will follow through on his threats or reverse course. Threatening politicians with political destruction simply because they don’t support a party’s chosen candidate sounds more like the behavior of authoritarian regimes than a democratic institution. This kind of pressure undermines the values of freedom and fair representation. If anyone is responsible for the current toxic climate in the GOP, it’s Reince Priebus. Those who stand up to Trump are the ones defending the party’s integrity.",1
"I’m probably heading to a really weird place for finding this hilarious, but I can’t stop laughing! There’s been a wild theory going around that Donald Trump is actually an alien posing as a human. At first glance, it sounds completely crazy, but consider this: he once said he “landed on Mars.” That’s not something you typically say when you’re just being dramatic. And then there’s this shocking clip that’s been circulating online:  

A protester shouts, “TRUMP TO THE MOON!”  
Trump responds with, “Let’s make it happen!”  

Now, I’ve never been to space, so I can’t be 100% sure, but I’m pretty certain it’s not a destination you’d get excited about. If that doesn’t have you laughing out loud, check this screenshot:  
Genius. Just… genius.",1
"Viewers of tonight’s debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump who decide to drink every time Biden makes an exaggerated claim could face severe health risks, according to the US Surgeon General. Following the chaotic exchanges in last year’s debates, emergency rooms reported a spike of 65,000 alcohol-related incidents. With Biden’s tendency to stretch the truth, first responders are preparing for what could be one of the worst nights of the season. According to The New York Times, Biden made a misleading statement every four minutes during a five-day stretch in August. Similar concerns arose before the Democratic primary debates, when medical experts warned of increased drinking behavior. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy stated, “We expect a surge in alcohol poisoning cases across the country as people participate in drinking games while watching the debate. The level of misinformation coming from this campaign is unprecedented.” With the current candidates, the likelihood of exaggerated statements is at its highest. The Mayo Clinic notes that symptoms of alcohol poisoning include nausea, slurred speech, loss of coordination, slow or irregular breathing, cold skin, and unconsciousness. Please remain vigilant and verify information carefully.",1
"Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush surprised many when she expressed her preference for voting for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over any Republican in the upcoming election. While Jeb Bush and both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have largely stayed silent on the race, they’ve now made a bold statement. Rumors are circulating that George H.W. Bush has decided not to support the GOP’s chosen candidate, a move that has caused quite a stir. Not only is he refusing to back his own party, but he's reportedly casting his ballot for the Democratic nominee instead. This decision has sparked intense debate, with some calling it a strategic choice for the country’s future. The Trump campaign, unsurprisingly, has reacted strongly. In a recent appearance on CNN, Kellyanne Conway criticized the elder Bush’s decision, suggesting it was driven by personal feelings rather than political judgment. She pointed out the irony of Bush supporting “the wife of the man who beat him in 1992,” and blamed the painful primary season for his apparent shift. Conway stated, “Jeb Bush didn’t meet expectations, and there are definitely hurt feelings.” You can watch the full interview below: “Jeb Bush really failed…there are a lot of hurt feelings” @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016  
This kind of reaction from the Trump team is expected. The Bush family is making a thoughtful, informed choice, something that clearly challenges the campaign’s narrow perspective. This election isn’t just about party lines—it’s about choosing a leader who can steer the nation in the right direction, and the Bushes seem to understand that.",1
"There has been growing debate about the fatal shooting of Keith Scott by Charlotte police. According to the police, the incident was a necessary response as Scott was holding a gun and posed a threat. However, Scott’s supporters argue that he was simply waiting for his kids at the bus stop and was holding a book, not a weapon. The truth remains unclear, but new information from Scott’s wife could offer further insight.  

Investigations into Scott’s past reveal that Rakeyia Scott had previously filed a restraining order against him, alleging physical abuse. In the document, she stated, “He hit my 8-year-old daughter in the head with his fist three times… He kicked me and threatened to kill us with his gun. He called himself a ‘killer’ and we should know that.” The form also asked if law enforcement should consider him a threat, and she responded “yes,” noting that he carried a 9mm handgun. The order was submitted on October 9th, 2015, but was later dropped by Scott’s wife just days later.  

This detail appears to support the police claim that Scott was armed and dangerous. Police have released dashcam and bodycam footage, along with images of the gun found on Scott at the scene. The weapon was reportedly the same one stolen from a home during a break-in.  

Officers also dispute the claim that Scott was peacefully waiting for his children. They initially noticed him rolling a blunt, which they did not immediately act on. However, when they saw him holding a gun, they intervened, citing the danger of combining drugs and firearms. The officers, who were in plain clothes at first, then put on marked uniforms and repeatedly ordered Scott to drop the weapon. He refused. DNA and fingerprints matching Scott were found on the loaded gun, reinforcing the police's stance.  

Once again, critics say the Black Lives Matter movement is using a lawful police action to incite unrest and promote a narrative of injustice.",1
"Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, *Between Two Ferns*. He’s previously interviewed President Obama, as well as stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Ariana Grande, but there's one person he's absolutely not interested in featuring. In a recent chat with *Rolling Stone*, Galifianakis was asked if he’d ever consider having Republican nominee Donald Trump on the show, following the success of his Clinton segment — and his response was both sharp and funny. “No way. It doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way around? Not my style. He’s the type who craves attention — any kind of attention. So you’re dealing with someone who’s a little unhinged. I wouldn’t want to put someone in that position who’s so mentally unstable. It would be taking advantage of them. And you can quote me on that.” *Between Two Ferns* is famous for its awkward exchanges and the host’s tendency to ask provocative questions (he once asked Obama, “How does it feel to know you might be the last white president?”). The humor comes from both sides trying to stay calm and not react. Considering how Trump reacts aggressively to even minor criticism and never lets anything slide, it's clear Galifianakis made the right call. But it's deeply concerning that someone who can't handle a comedy interview could still be a serious contender for the presidency — he’s repeatedly shown he’s not suited for the role.",1
"It appears that FBI Director James Comey is finding himself in a deepening firestorm, with the heat rising by the day. He allowed Hillary Clinton to escape without consequence over the email scandal, despite acknowledging her dishonesty and potential guilt. The reasoning behind this decision remains a mystery to many. Comey released heavily redacted transcripts from his conversations with Clinton, which offered little clarity. Meanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch faced criticism for meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before Hillary's case was dropped, raising questions about whether she was briefed on how to respond during her testimony. Congress has repeatedly asked Comey for specific documents related to the email investigation, but he has consistently refused to hand them over. In response, Texas Representative Lamar Smith issued a subpoena demanding the release of these materials. According to the Daily Caller, FBI Director Comey’s recommendation to not pursue charges against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while at the State Department continues to draw sharp criticism from political analysts. The handling of the case, including Comey's release of censored interview notes and Lynch's private meeting with Bill Clinton, has come under intense scrutiny. After questioning Comey on Capitol Hill, lawmakers requested the documents to better understand the extent of Clinton’s off-the-record email activities. However, Comey has yet to provide them, prompting Congress to push harder for transparency. The Washington Times reported that House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, issued a subpoena to Comey for information regarding the security of Clinton’s private email account and server. Smith had previously requested the documents in a letter, but the subpoena followed after Comey failed to comply. “The committee still has concerns about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff met the cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the committee stated. But I suspect they’ll face the same resistance as always — from the Obama administration, the FBI, and the Clintons. It seems the three branches of government are no longer independent. The Executive Branch holds too much power, the Judicial Branch is too compliant, and the Legislative Branch is left powerless. There’s no clearer example of this imbalance than the ongoing controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton.",1
"I’d say our leader is ineffective, but honestly, this goes way beyond that and into outright negligence. He’s made some questionable decisions and said a few thoughtless things in the past, but this? This is just out of touch in the worst way. If you're reading this, you’ve probably been following the news or at least aware of recent events. If so, you already know about the shootings in Chicago and Dallas last week, as well as the fire that broke out in Phoenix. You’d expect that something like this would prompt an immediate response from our leaders, but you’d be wrong. You’d hope the person you elected would at least show some support for the victims, especially when it's happening right here at home. You’d hope they'd do it for the people, even if not for the sake of genuine concern, just for political gain. Well, apparently, our leader doesn’t feel that way. In fact, while he was in Chicago, he didn’t say a word about the shootings—he spent his time instead at a private event with wealthy donors. Are you angry yet? It gets worse. Instead of addressing the violence that rocked the nation, he complained about “bias” in the media, specifically targeting conservative outlets, claiming they’re responsible for the decline in public support for the opposing candidate. He criticized the other side while praising the one he supports, all while completely ignoring the lives that were changed by the incidents that had just occurred. Some might argue he didn’t have all the facts, but you don’t need every detail to say, “A shooting has taken place in Chicago, and I want to express my condolences to those affected. I’ll provide more information once I have it.” But no, he didn’t even bother. Absolutely disgraceful.",1
"Now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ). Now that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t.  If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him. The irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. Not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. With so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government?  As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  They think they can get away with it.  And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  In today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country. What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house? This issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent.  It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof.  When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  As Ronald Reagan said, “ Trust but verify”.  There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat.  The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena. Faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to “Roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good. . There are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to Congress.  With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by Plato’s Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment.",1
"In a time when government and media continue to expand, a dedicated American has uncovered what the Department of Justice and major news outlets have failed (or refused) to reveal: Evidence suggesting that Hillary Clinton was involved in a deliberate effort to conceal her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Thanks to the reach of social media, a Twitter user known as @ConservativeThinkTank has compiled a series of digital clues that have now been shared with the House Judiciary Committee, prompting a fresh inquiry. Paul Combetta, the IT expert who worked for Hillary Clinton, is alleged to have sought assistance from the public via the online forum Reddit under the username “stonetear” during the summer and fall of 2014. He posted numerous questions asking for technical guidance on how to delete or alter emails, specifically referencing an ""unknown high-profile client"" whose details needed to be removed from both active and archived email systems. One of his posts read, “I’m dealing with a situation where I need to remove a VIP’s email address from a number of archived messages. They don’t want this information exposed. Any advice on how to do this safely?” The House Judiciary Committee has requested that Reddit preserve all related content for further review. While the outcome of the investigation remains uncertain, it is clear that ordinary citizens have unearthed what powerful institutions have tried to suppress: potential evidence of illegal activity by Hillary Clinton. The key question now is whether the username “stonetear” can be definitively linked to Paul Combetta. If not, the case remains circumstantial. If it can, it would establish a direct connection between Clinton and a suspected cover-up. @ConservativeThinkTank has presented several pieces of evidence supporting the claim that “stonetear” is indeed Combetta. This story has not received much attention, likely due to media reluctance to spotlight a regular citizen's investigative work. As more people become aware of this development and the evidence is formally submitted to the committee, the efforts of everyday Americans—like @ConservativeThinkTank and the writers at IPatriot—will continue to challenge the status quo.

"The Benghazi scandal and the misleading narrative that Hillary Clinton has spun around it is something she’d probably like to erase from history. Fortunately, there are brave citizens across the country who won’t let her get away with it. Take this young man, for example. His name is Ethan, and unlike many of his peers, he’s a firm believer in conservative values. This was clearly shown when he showed up at school wearing a bold ""Hillary for Jail 2016"" T-shirt. He regularly debates politics with one of his teachers, who happens to be a known liberal. What happened next was nothing short of inspiring.  

Ethan wore his “Hillary for Jail 2016” shirt to high school, which caught the attention of a pro-Clinton teacher with whom he often discusses politics. According to a post from his father on social media, the teacher asked, “Did you wear that for me?” Ethan calmly replied, “No, for Chris Stevens.” The teacher was taken aback, and the class was left in stunned silence. The story, originally shared online, has since been removed, likely due to pressure from those who don’t want such voices to be heard. But Ethan's courage deserves recognition. He stood up against political bias in a classroom setting, reminding everyone that it's okay to speak out—even when it's uncomfortable. Christopher Stevens, the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, died during the Benghazi attack under Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. This tale, though briefly circulated online, highlights the importance of standing firm in one's beliefs. (Source: American Free Press) h/t Mike Lindell",1
"If you're a Patriots fan, I hope you value your country and freedom over political agendas. Personally, I’m considering boycotting the team and might even stop watching the NFL altogether, despite there being some decent players. Recently, three New England Patriots players raised the Black Power fist during the National Anthem at their game. I'm tired of this nonsense. I've seen similar protests from other athletes before, and even some celebrities have done it too. This is completely unacceptable—it’s a provocative, divisive act that should not be allowed. It's no different than a Nazi salute. Did you know that ESPN recently published a full-page article supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, highlighting Patriots player Trey Flowers? That’s another one to watch.

This happened just days after a black man attacked a police officer in Boston, shooting her multiple times in the chest. She survived because of her body armor. He then shot a security guard and took a civilian hostage. He fired several rounds into a car with two people inside, killing one and seriously injuring the other. He was eventually killed by another officer who confronted him. These football players are promoting racial division at a Patriots game, effectively endorsing the chaos. They’re wealthy, self-righteous individuals who have benefited from this country’s opportunities. I think fans have had enough. We support America, our military, and our law enforcement. This nation was becoming more united until Obama came along. Now we're divided, and a cultural conflict is rising. These entitled, rich athletes, who have been given the chance to succeed, now hate the country and the fans who helped them live comfortably. I say cut them off. No game is worth encouraging racism and hatred like this.

"Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has long championed the admission of large numbers of Syrian refugees, pushing for an open-door policy that led to a dramatic surge in migration. This decision quickly spiraled into chaos, with reports of widespread crime, including numerous sexual assaults and violent incidents across German cities over the past year. Faced with growing public anger, the German electorate delivered a severe blow to Merkel’s conservative party, voting them out in overwhelming numbers. In response, Merkel took the podium to backtrack on her earlier stance, admitting that the migrant crisis could have been managed better and expressing regret over her decisions. She described multiculturalism as a “false promise,” and echoed her famous slogan, “we can do this,” while hinting that Germany needed to regain control over immigration flows. “Continuing the current pace of arrivals will eventually strain the state and society beyond its limits,” she warned. Despite the backlash, she refused to set a strict cap on incoming migrants, instead pledging to reduce numbers through coordinated efforts at the national, European, and global levels. She defended her initial decision to allow mass migration, calling it a “moral obligation,” and urged the party to draw on its historical resilience to overcome the crisis. Merkel proposed a combination of stricter border controls, increased support for Turkey to manage refugee flows, and a more equitable distribution system among EU countries. She also highlighted steps already taken in Germany, such as expediting deportations of those whose asylum claims were denied. Having led the country for over a decade, she tried to project optimism, claiming Germany was no longer the “sick man of Europe” and was becoming a more open, tolerant, and forward-looking nation. While some may appreciate her shift, many feel it’s too late to undo the damage. As the U.S. election approaches, the same pattern is repeating—Hillary Clinton continues to push for more immigration, and if she wins, the consequences could be dire. It’s time to take a stand and vote wisely in November. (Source: Daily Mail)",1
"Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed “law and order” candidate, painted a grim image of urban life, claiming that African-American and Hispanic communities in inner cities are trapped in a cycle of violence and danger. ""We have inner cities where people are living in hell because it's so unsafe,"" he stated earlier this week. He praised the now-defunct ""stop-and-frisk"" policy, originally used by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as a way to combat crime in densely populated areas. However, his claims were quickly challenged by factual data, and the police department in his own city called him out for spreading misleading information and implying that the NYPD isn't doing its job effectively. During the debate, NYPD Assistant Commissioner for Communications and Public Information, J. Peter Donald, directly addressed Trump’s false narratives, stating that the Republican’s push to bring back ""stop-and-frisk"" is nothing more than coded language for his far-right supporters. The policy, which was ended under Mayor Bloomberg in 2011, was widely criticized for disproportionately targeting minorities and failing to reduce crime. In fact, crime rates dropped significantly after its cancellation, thanks to improved policing strategies. Trump is attempting to scare the public with a dystopian vision of America that doesn’t reflect reality — and the officers he’s trying to win over aren’t fooled.",1
"The Weiner is back, once more, in the headlines and if you thought he couldn’t get any worse, well you’d be wrong… I mean, come on. It’s Anthony “Douchey” Weiner… I like the way that sounds. Anyway, back in 2016, Anthony Weiner, 51, was still married to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, and allegedly had a months-long online sexual relationship with a 16-year-old girl whose identity remains unknown for obvious reasons. “I have made some really poor choices when it comes to who I’ve communicated with online and what I’ve shared,” Weiner admitted during an interview on Fox News. The story goes like this. In early 2016, Weiner began a sexting relationship with a teenage girl through KIK. He knew she was under 18 because he asked her where she went to school. That pretty much removes any plausible deniability. This man was married, so sexting with someone other than his wife shows just how morally bankrupt he is. They exchanged explicit photos and messages, and at one point, Weiner reportedly went to the girl’s house when her father wasn’t home. She claims he pushed her into deeper conversations until she said she felt uncomfortable, and he stopped. The girl’s father is furious and believes her mental health has been severely affected. “If there are others out there who’ve gone through something similar, I hope they can find the strength to speak up, using my daughter’s experience as a guide,” he said. “She’s been through some depression, and we’ve gotten her help. We’re working through it, but this has definitely taken a toll on her. She's a smart kid, and now it feels like that light has dimmed.” Alright, Dad. Weiner is clearly a creep and a predator, no question. But let’s not ignore the facts. Your daughter was part of this. She’s not some perfect angel. How did Weiner end up in your house? Did he break in? Be honest. Weiner is a total scumbag and will likely face serious consequences. About time.",1
"UPDATE: The story just keeps unfolding. Keith Lamont Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, claimed the man was reading… the Quran… before he was shot. You can’t make this up, folks! Why hasn’t the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief, Kerr Putney, released the footage of the encounter with Keith Lamont Scott? According to the chief, it's clear that Scott had a weapon. However, he later changed his stance, stating, “The video doesn’t provide me with absolute, visual proof that someone was holding a gun.” What does that mean? From his statement, one logical conclusion is that Scott did have a handgun. Additional evidence and witness reports back up the police account that officers fired only after Scott refused to drop his weapon, meaning he was indeed holding it. It wasn’t a book, as some “witnesses and family members” have suggested. Therefore, since the weapon was in his hand, Scott likely intended to use it. Yet progressive media outlets like the Huffington Post interpreted Putney’s comments differently, claiming, “He noted that the video doesn’t confirm Scott was holding a gun when he was shot.” That’s not what the chief said. Putney clearly chose his words with care. We don’t know why—just that he did. Watching the press conference clip adds more clarity to his remarks. As he explains there's ""no definitive evidence"" that ""a person"" was pointing a gun, he uses his hand to… Read the full article at www.iPatriot.com.

"Warning, Muslims, if you try to recite prayers loudly on a flight, there could be consequences! A couple named Omar and Layla boarded a United Airlines flight from London to New York. The plane was delayed on the tarmac for about an hour. During that time, several crew members observed the couple repeatedly chanting “Allahu Akbar” and appeared nervous. Their behavior made some staff uneasy, according to a report by The Guardian. One of the flight attendants, after consulting with the captain, asked the couple to leave the plane due to “safety concerns.” In a video shared online, Layla became upset, questioning whether it was “religious discrimination.” The captain responded that it was a “security issue.” According to a source, when the couple disembarked, a U.S. airport security officer was waiting and reviewed their documents. They were briefly questioned but allowed to proceed. A United Airlines representative later stated that the crew had concerns about their unusual behavior and felt it was necessary to remove them for the safety of everyone on board. The couple was rebooked on a different flight and received a refund as an apology. However, they took the incident as evidence of “anti-Muslim bias.” They immediately contacted the Muslim Advocates group, which criticized the airline for alleged discrimination against Muslim travelers. The group claims that such incidents are becoming more frequent, though United denies any bias. Meanwhile, some passengers support the crew’s decision, saying that in today’s climate, airlines must take every precaution. If someone acts suspiciously, they may be removed, no matter their religion. After all, safety should always come first. What do you think? Did the crew do the right thing?

"The incident at the Minneapolis mall last Saturday was fueled by the failure of Muslim immigrants to integrate into American society. The perpetrator, a 22-year-old Somali-American college student named Dahir Adan, stabbed nine people before being killed by a retired police officer who was licensed to carry a firearm. As expected, it took a law-abiding gun owner to stop the attack. It's absurd, but it took the media several days to recognize the attack as Islamist in nature, even though the attacker was loudly chanting ""Allah Akbar"" during the assault. Did they really think he was trying to say ""Hail Mary""? Doubtful. In fact, Adan and his entire family had lived in the U.S. for over 15 years without making any effort to adopt American customs or values. According to the Young Cons, Adan’s father, Ahmed Adan, stated through a translator that he had no idea his son was involved in terrorism. He explained that Dahir was born in Kenya and moved to the U.S. 15 years ago. The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility, calling Adan a ""fighter"" who acted in response to U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Adan’s father, speaking through an interpreter, said he had no prior knowledge of his son’s extremist views. He also confirmed that Dahir had been in the U.S. for 15 years after being born in Kenya. Many have criticized the slow assimilation of Middle Eastern and African refugees into American life. @AnnCoulter: Assimilation is a farce. After 15 years, they still don’t speak English, and they want to reshape America, not become part of it. Disgusting. — @JustKate038, September 19, 2016  
MN mall attacker’s family has been in the U.S. for 15 years. His father confirmed his identity “through an interpreter.” https://t.co/wxHoMoC5FW — @AnnCoulter, September 18, 2016  
In Europe, especially in countries like France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, there have been ongoing issues with integrating Muslim migrants. Polls show that many American Muslims identify more as “Muslims first” than “Americans first.” When Trump talks about deporting Muslims who support Sharia Law, some liberals object—something to think about.",1
"The question of what a debate moderator should do during a presidential debate has become more critical than ever in this election cycle, as Donald Trump has consistently demonstrated a pattern of making false claims without hesitation or remorse. His talent for delivering blatant falsehoods with complete confidence has made him a unique and controversial figure on the campaign trail. Recently, Brian Williams hosted a pre-debate interview with both candidates, which was supposed to serve as a test run for the main event. While Williams pressed Clinton on her policy positions and the controversy surrounding her email server, he appeared to back down when confronting Trump. Many critics were outraged by the lack of accountability, particularly when Trump falsely claimed that he had always been against the Iraq War—a claim that is easily disproven and one that Williams likely knew was untrue.  

There was hope that the actual debates would be different. If Trump continues to spread misinformation during the events, moderators should be prepared to challenge his statements directly. Naturally, Trump has been the loudest voice criticizing this idea. In a recent appearance on Fox News, he suggested that there would be “people watching” to ensure he isn’t interrupted, and that he should be allowed to speak freely. He even criticized Candy Crawley, who famously corrected Mitt Romney during the 2012 debate, calling it an unfair tactic.  

Trump prefers a free-for-all format where he and Clinton can go at it without interruption, regardless of whether what he says is true. “I think there’s a lot of pressure on [first debate moderator Lester Holt],” he said. “He’s a good guy, but there’s a lot of pressure.” He also mentioned his recent town hall meeting with Clinton, where he faced tough questions but still came out looking strong. “They went after Matt Lauer, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” he added. “That’s what they’re doing with Lester Holt—and a lot of people are watching to see if he gives in.”  

The contrast between Trump's team and Clinton’s is clear. While Democrats are pushing for factual accuracy and accountability, Republicans—especially Trump—want moderators to stay out of the way. As reporter Greg Sergent from the Washington Post pointed out, one side wants truth, the other wants silence. Whether this is about fairness or strategy is debatable, but the fact remains that Trump lies far more often and more brazenly than Clinton. Most Clinton supporters would likely accept equal treatment for both candidates, and if they don’t",1
"This incident took place in May, but it’s just as relevant now, especially with 15,000 to 25,000 Syrian refugees expected to enter the U.S. in the coming weeks. Authorities in Arizona pulled over a vehicle driven by an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East. That alone was concerning, but what they found inside made the situation even more alarming. The woman was carrying blueprints for a pipeline that could be used for a terrorist attack. This is clearly a sign of extremist activity. While the reason for the stop remains unclear, it was a fortunate coincidence that the officers checked the car. Reports have surfaced suggesting that hundreds, if not thousands, of illegal immigrants linked to Islamic extremist groups are attempting to cross our southern border. Judicial Watch released a study last year revealing that Mexican drug cartels are increasingly smuggling individuals from nations with known terrorist ties into the U.S. A follow-up report from the same group last month indicated that Islamic extremist cells based in Mexico are now actively planning trips into America to scout potential targets. The border has become a dangerous hotspot for terrorism. It's not a matter of if, but when we face a devastating attack that could claim many lives—and it all starts with the policies of Barack Obama and his allies who support open borders. They want America to mirror Europe, which is already suffering from the consequences of mass migration and rising extremism. No way. From a source called Truth Today: Law enforcement in Arizona recently stopped a vehicle and discovered it was being driven by an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The situation escalated when officers found suspicious materials in the car, leading to heightened security in the area. According to Judicial Watch, a sheriff’s deputy in Cochise County pulled over an unnamed ""Islamic immigrant"" for an unknown reason. Fortunately, what started as a minor traffic stop turned into a major discovery when the officer uncovered plans for a pipeline in the vehicle. The location is near the town of Nogales, Arizona, just 10 miles south of the Mexican border. The FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force have been deployed to investigate the find. This incident may be just the beginning. Obama is set to bring in up to 200,000 Islamic refugees this year, spreading them across the country to influence political outcomes and reshape the nation’s identity. Allowing unvetted extremists into the U.S. increases the risk of ISIS infiltration, and Obama seems indifferent. What’s one or two",1
"What do Tom Brady and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL anymore. The other difference is that Tom Brady is a legendary leader and respected figure, while the other is seen as divisive. Brady remained quiet when asked about Kaepernick’s protest during the National Anthem and his criticism of a system that many believe mistreats people of color. Brady is known for his leadership on the field, his charitable work, and his long-standing reputation as a team player. His comments on Kaepernick were brief but pointed: “People have the right to express their views,” Brady said, “but it’s important to do it in a way that respects everyone.” The key word here is “respect.” Kaepernick, who makes millions as a backup quarterback, should consider where and how he chooses to speak out. He could protest on social media, at a Black Lives Matter event, or even outside a Walmart where workers are fighting for fair wages. But protesting during the national anthem, especially when you’re being paid to play football, comes off as disrespectful to fans and the country. Saying you’re oppressed is just an excuse for not taking responsibility. How did Martin Luther King Jr. achieve change? He worked for it, not by complaining. Name one person who’s truly oppressed, and I’ll show you why they could have done more. Oppression is a lie used by those who don’t want to put in the effort. If anyone is oppressed, it's people who lost opportunities because of reverse discrimination. Brady stayed quiet because he knows how to handle the spotlight. He’s focused on his future and helping others. Good for Brady, and I hope he finds a new role that fits his talents. Screw Kaepernick.",1
"Jason Falconer, a certified NRA firearms instructor and former police officer, who subdued a violent ISIS-affiliated attacker in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is a target of Hillary Clinton’s political agenda. According to reports, Clinton has made it clear that one of her top priorities would be to shut down Falconer’s business if she were elected president. This courageous individual saved multiple lives by stopping a terrorist who had already injured several people at a local mall. The same type of immigrant that Obama and Clinton have shown excessive support for—despite the dangers they pose. Falconer runs Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, a company that teaches responsible gun ownership and self-defense, which Clinton allegedly sees as a threat to her anti-gun policies. As owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC, he provides training, gun rentals, and sales to law-abiding citizens who wish to protect themselves from crime and terrorism. If elected, Clinton plans to dismantle such businesses through legal attacks and policy changes. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) shields companies like Falconer’s from baseless lawsuits, but Clinton seeks to eliminate this protection, opening the door for aggressive legal battles. She has falsely claimed that the PLCAA grants gun manufacturers “absolute immunity,” a misleading statement typical of her rhetoric. Her deep opposition to the Second Amendment makes her a dangerous figure for gun rights advocates. Falconer, who served as a police officer before transitioning to firearms education, has dedicated his career to helping others defend themselves. Now, Clinton aims to silence him and destroy his life’s work. The fact that he confronted an Islamic extremist likely fuels her hostility. Don’t vote for Clinton—support those who protect our freedoms, not those who seek to erase them.",1
"Two girls were out with their father enjoying dinner at a diner in Sacramento, California. After finishing their meal, they exited the restaurant and that’s when things turned dangerous. The two teenage girls, both around 110 lbs, and their father came across a group of aggressive individuals. It was a group associated with Black Lives Matter. The group surrounded the family, attacked them with punches and kicks, threw bottles at them, yelled racial slurs, and left them severely injured enough to require emergency medical care. What did these people do to deserve this? They were simply having a quiet family night. If those involved in Black Lives Matter had more stable upbringings, maybe they wouldn’t be so angry. Many Black parents have multiple children and don’t provide proper care. The fathers are often absent or not involved. How can that be healthy? And no, it's not racist to point this out. It's just the truth. Walk into any inner-city neighborhood and ask these “parents” why they have so many kids, no job, and many children with different surnames. It’s a mess. One of the Black Lives Matter attackers showed just how foolish these people can be. He bragged online about the assault and even claimed to have a video! Once people found out, they flooded his social media with outrage, causing his account to be taken down. He might have deleted it and disappeared. As far as I know, he hasn’t been arrested yet. If you're in Northern California and spot this man, contact the police and share this article. He likely lives in or near Sacramento. His photo is below on the left. He’s the thin Hispanic guy who probably wouldn’t have stood a chance against the teen girls if he wasn’t with a group. Black Lives Matter is a hate group that spreads division. They haven’t done anything good for the community. All they do is cause trouble, riot, and attack innocent people. No one will respect them until they start acting responsibly. They’re a bunch of lost individuals, idle people, and violent troublemakers. Every member of Black Lives Matter should think about why they’re part of such a destructive movement.",1
"Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush surprised many Americans when she expressed her preference for voting for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over any Republican in this election. While Jeb Bush and both of his fathers, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, have largely remained quiet throughout the campaign—until now—a new development has sparked attention. It has been revealed that George H.W. Bush is choosing not to support the Republican nominee, a decision that has caused quite a stir. Not only is he refusing to back his own party, but he's casting his ballot for the Democratic candidate instead. This move is seen as highly controversial, yet it reflects what some believe is a strategic choice for the nation’s future. The Trump campaign has responded with predictable frustration. In a recent appearance on CNN, Kellyanne Conway, then Trump’s campaign manager, criticized the elder Bush’s decision, calling it ironic that he would support “the wife of the man who beat him in 1992.” She also suggested that his choice was driven by personal feelings over his son’s loss to Trump in the primaries, saying, “This was a tough primary, and Jeb Bush didn’t meet expectations.” You can watch the clip here: “Jeb Bush really failed… there are a lot of hurt feelings” @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016. The Trump team’s reaction is expected, but the Bush family’s stance shows they’re making a thoughtful, informed choice in a critical election. This race isn’t just about party politics—it’s about protecting the country from a leader who could bring chaos, and the Bushes seem to understand that.",1
"A recent probe has revealed that Donald Trump’s charitable foundation funneled donor money into covering his legal expenses, breaking rules that prevent nonprofits from using donations to benefit their own leaders or affiliated businesses. Using a simple signature, Trump diverted the average income of several working Americans to pay off his corporate penalties: According to interviews and court filings, Trump’s foundation spent over $250,000 on legal settlements tied to his for-profit ventures, including four documented cases where he may have engaged in ""self-dealing"" — a violation that bars nonprofit executives from using charity funds for personal gain. The Washington Post's David Farenthold has been relentlessly following every lead connected to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, using an old notebook (which has been publicly displayed) to conduct what the mainstream media has avoided: a full-scale examination of Trump’s history of questionable financial practices and alleged corruption. His latest findings have prompted multiple major Florida newspapers to demand a federal inquiry into the Trump University scandal, where the same foundation that was used to pay lawsuits also illegally contributed to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s campaign. Farenthold’s work also shows that Trump used the foundation to cover a $120,000 fine related to Mar-a-Lago, his luxury estate in Palm Beach. Instead of donating to a veterans’ group as required, Trump took the money from donors who had already contributed to the charity. The dispute began over a flagpole: In 2007, Mar-a-Lago was fined $120,000 by Palm Beach for a flagpole that was too large. The town agreed to forgive the debt if the club donated $100,000 to a veterans’ charity. Instead, Trump used a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation — a charity largely funded by others — to fulfill the requirement. This wasn’t just charity; it was a direct financial boost to one of Trump’s most valuable properties. It wouldn’t be the last time Trump exploited his foundation with little more than a signature. When Trump promotes his golf course in Scotland during a campaign stop, keep in mind that his golf operations often face legal trouble. The Washington Post reported that one of his New York golf courses settled a lawsuit by donating to a charity chosen by the plaintiff. A $158,000 donation came from the Trump Foundation, per tax records. Additionally, Trump used foundation funds to purchase a 6-foot",1
"Hillary Clinton’s public appearances are getting more questionable by the day… especially when she collapses, is carried out of a venue, and ends up in an ambulance — all caught on camera and on 9/11. At Temple University, which enrolls over 38,000 students, Clinton held a small rally that barely attracted 200 people. Her campaign claims it was full, but that’s just another misleading spin. It looked like there were more journalists present than actual students. Truly embarrassing. As seen in the photos below, Trump rallies are packed with thousands of supporters. But it's not just about numbers. Clinton struggled to climb just four steps to reach the stage, and a staffer had to assist her as if she were frail and weak. Not exactly the image of strength or leadership. Some are even betting on how long she has left. From Top Right News: Hillary Clinton visited Temple University on Monday to connect with young voters. With nearly 38,000 students, the event was supposed to be a major turnout. Instead, it was sparsely attended. Clinton also had difficulty climbing a short set of stairs to the stage, requiring assistance to move forward. Photos of ""Grandma Clinton"" were widely shared by Getty: PHILADELPHIA, PA – SEPTEMBER 19: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is assisted up the stairs after speaking at Temple University on September 19, 2016, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Clinton is campaigning in Pennsylvania. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) From the empty rallies to the obvious physical decline… the Hildabeast is in serious trouble. Her campaign is struggling, especially in states like Delaware and Ohio, where millions live but no one showed up for her events. Plus, recent leaks suggest her top IT consultant and Clinton were trying to cover up email issues. That’s a major scandal. And now, WikiLeaks is about to release new information — this time about Clinton allegedly smuggling weapons to al Qaeda in Benghazi. Something Glenn Beck warned about from the start. This scandal could resurface with a vengeance. With all this, several outcomes are possible… she could lose badly to Trump, who seems to be gaining momentum… she could die before the election, or she could be impeached right after being elected. Not a good situation. The Democrats made a huge mistake choosing her. They’re terrified, and they should be.",1
"Next week’s debate could be the most-watched Presidential showdown in DECADES. That is, if both candidates actually make it to the stage. Conservative blogger and Right Wing News founder Michael Yon recently shared a report claiming that an anonymous ""political insider"" informed him that Donald Trump might be considering skipping Monday’s debate. According to this source, a well-known conservative figure reached out to Yon on Tuesday, suggesting that Trump could be avoiding the event due to concerns over his performance. Some are questioning whether this is just a tactic to generate more hype for the highly anticipated clash between the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton. With recent speculation about the former president's health, some believe he may be using a “medical issue” as an excuse to stay away. Is this a real development, or just another attempt to stir up support for Trump? What do you think about the credibility of these claims?",1
"Police have uncovered some alarming clues in the Chelsea bombing that took place last Saturday. The primary suspect remains Muslim extremists, who have publicly claimed responsibility for the attack that left dozens injured. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 individuals, all of whom have since been released from the hospital. A second pressure-cooker device was discovered hidden in a trash bin just a few blocks away.  

Authorities are still trying to piece together exactly what occurred. So far, three leads have caught the media's attention:  
Lead #1 – A handwritten note, partially written in Arabic, was discovered inside the same plastic bag that contained the second explosive.  
Lead #2 – A mysterious 911 call from an unknown male warned of additional explosions, saying, “I saw the blast down the street. More are coming.”  
Lead #3 – A Tumblr blog titled “I’m the NY Bomber” has surfaced, claiming to be the manifesto of the person behind the explosion that shook New York City on Saturday night. HERE.  

Manufacturing Test Explosives  
Hi. You’ve probably seen the news by now—explosives went off in New York City, and that was me. These were just practice runs, and I know where I messed up. I won’t make the same mistakes next time. I did it because I can't stand how society treats people like me. I'm part of the LGBTQ+ community, and we're still being mocked, shunned, and called mentally unstable. It's 2016, and we're still considered sinners or attention seekers. I won't sit back while marginalized groups are oppressed. I won't stand by while racism is rampant, especially when it comes from white police officers across the country. I won't live in a nation where a misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, Islamophobic, Republican candidate is even taken seriously. Republicans are just privileged, cisgendered white men. This isn’t over—it’s only the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will take out my targets before it’s too late. Someone is lying, and it’s disgusting that anyone would try to claim this, especially someone who had nothing to do with it. Using others' terror for personal gain is the lowest thing you can do.",1
"Both of the 2016 presidential candidates were given the opportunity to address the recent explosions in Chicago and Philadelphia. While there are many contrasts between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, these videos highlight them clearly. Watch! Here’s how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton reacted to last night’s Chicago bombing. Trump said, “Just before I landed, a bomb exploded in New York, and no one has any idea what’s happening,” he told a crowd at a rally in Ohio. “We’re living in a dangerous time — we need to be strong, folks. We have to be smart, alert, and tough.” His remarks came just minutes after the blast.  

Hillary, on the other hand, appeared disoriented during her statement, seeming confused and inconsistent. At the 0:35 mark in the video, she said, “I’ve been informed about the bombings in Chicago and Philadelphia, as well as the incident in Virginia.” Then, at 1:12, when asked if she agreed with Trump calling the explosion a “bomb,” she responded, “It’s important to rely on facts and support the first responders who are investigating what actually happened.”  

What was she thinking? Did she believe it was a prank or something else? The contrast in their composure is staggering. Hillary Clinton is clearly not fit to lead the nation. It’s time for her to step down and take a break.",1
"(CNN) Former President George H.W. Bush revealed Tuesday that he plans to support Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election, according to multiple sources familiar with the 41st president's remarks — a rare and unexpected statement from a member of his party's presidential candidate. The information surfaced during a brief exchange at a gathering hosted by the nonpartisan Points of Light Foundation, where Bush was speaking with Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and former Maryland lieutenant governor. The conversation took place among about 30 attendees, and while not everyone in the room heard it, several confirmed the remark. 

This development marks a surprising shift in the long-standing political dynamic between the Bush and Clinton families, whose histories have been intertwined for decades. The timing is especially notable, as the first presidential debate between Clinton and Donald Trump is just 50 days away. 

Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, responded to the news by expressing respect for the 92-year-old former president but noted the irony of his choice. “It’s interesting that he would support the wife of the man who defeated him,” she said on CNN. “But we all know how tough this primary season was.”

The initial report came through social media when Kennedy Townsend shared a photo of herself with Bush, captioning it: “The President told me he's voting for Hillary!” She later removed the post, sparking some controversy over the disclosure of a private conversation. A spokesperson for Bush emphasized that the former president would not be commenting on the race until after the election. 

While Bush has not publicly addressed the issue, several members of his administration have expressed support for Clinton. Former national security advisor Brent Scowcroft endorsed her earlier this year, praising her leadership experience. Similarly, former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez called her a ""great choice"" and voiced concerns about Trump’s potential impact on the country.

However, not all members of the Bush family are in agreement. Marvin Bush, the former president's son, has indicated he will vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, while his grandson, George P. Bush, supports Trump. Jeb Bush, who previously ran against Trump in the primaries, has also declined to take a side.

The relationship between the Bush and Clinton families has evolved over time, beginning with Bill Clinton's 1992 victory over George H.W. Bush. Despite their political rivalry, both families have collaborated on various charitable efforts. Recently, Bill Clinton and George W.",1

"Okay, I have to say, I watched the debate last night hoping to see Hillary stumble, maybe even have a breakdown or start coughing uncontrollably like she’s been doing lately. But nothing like that happened. In fact, she looked totally composed—perfect makeup, no visible wrinkles (my mom was shocked), new hair color, and her hair was sleek and polished. I was wondering how she managed to stand through the whole thing without help, especially after all those strange episodes of coughing, falling, and shaking that we’ve seen over the past few months. The first half of the debate, her eyes looked tired, but by the second half, whatever she took must have kicked in. She was sharp, focused, and aggressive. 

My friend Sarah said she was disappointed in Trump, but admitted he was up against a real politician—and a congenital liar. I’m not sure if she lied outright during the debate (maybe about supporting the Iraq War?), but she definitely has a cold, calculating demeanor. There are still two more debates, and I really hope Trump comes in more prepared and can hit back with some good lines. 

I was excited to watch Trump at first, but once Hillary got going, she was like a general on the offensive. She didn’t care that her red outfit made her look intimidating; she let her claws out. She did a great job of luring Trump into traps, and he fell for it every time. Even though most people agreed she dominated the debate, the liberal panel from PBS News Hour seemed downcast, almost defeated by her performance. Yes, she won, but they said she didn’t offer anything meaningful. They didn’t feel that “spark” or “connection” during her speech. They weren’t even thrilled that she basically humiliated Trump, who had that expensive blonde hair (which isn’t fake, I’ve seen it up close). 

Even CNN’s David Gergen, a respected analyst, said that Clinton didn’t do enough. His recent headline read: “Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?” Before the debate, I thought a strong win would secure the election for Hillary. Afterward, it was clear she won decisively, but I think the race will stay tight. Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards—they’ve grown tired of politicians making promises they don’t keep. They saw the media bias again last night and were quick to point it out. Trump may be loud, but he",1
"Doesn’t this outrage you, even just a little? The NFL isn’t the only place where things are getting out of hand—high school athletes across the country are now kneeling during the national anthem in support of Black Lives Matter. But here’s the kicker: when an athlete speaks out against BLM, he gets punished. Seattle Mariners’ starting pitcher Jake Smith has been suspended for the rest of the season after criticizing Black Lives Matter and President Obama on social media. “BLM is a disgrace! Obama is a disgrace! Everyone involved should be held accountable like criminals!” Smith wrote about the protests in Minneapolis. He also posted, “Black people fighting whites over a cop shooting? Hilarious! Keep kneeling for the flag!” The team released a statement confirming his suspension without pay. According to reports, Smith could lose around $40,000 in earnings. And naturally, there's the apology. In a statement, Smith said, “I want to sincerely apologize to the Seattle Mariners, my teammates, my family, and the fans for the pain my tweets caused. I was upset by what I saw on the news and expressed myself poorly. I never intended to offend anyone, and I’m truly sorry if my words were taken the wrong way. “I grew up in St. Louis, a city with a rich cultural history, and I’ve always believed in judging people by their character, not their race. I have friends from all backgrounds, and I’ve never been one to make assumptions based on skin color. I just want people to understand that my comments were not meant to be racist. “I believe in free speech and supporting our police officers. I’m frustrated by what’s happening in our country, but I want to be part of the solution, not the problem. I hope we can all work together to build a better future.” Once again, I apologize to anyone who was hurt by my words. Thank you, and God bless.

It’s frustrating, to say the least.",1
"Famous TV personality and longtime advocate Montel Williams clashed this weekend with Trump-aligned Pastor Mark Burns, who took to social media to criticize the mainstream press for not instantly labeling last weekend’s explosion in New York as “terrorism.” A native of the city, Montel refused to let the Trump supporter spread the same misleading rhetoric that the former president often uses following attacks in the West. He called out both Burns and Trump as frauds, accusing the pastor of hypocrisy for backing a leader who shows no regard for truth or public safety.  

Donald Trump clearly sees himself as untouchable, driven only by self-interest, and Pastor Burns’ endorsement of him is a clear example of someone trading integrity for influence. Williams was entirely justified in calling him out. A suspect has been arrested in connection with the bombing in Chelsea and the placement of multiple homemade explosives across New Jersey.",1
"Progressive Democrats are the ""nanny state"" of America. They try to shield people so intensely that they prevent real growth and self-reliance, which is contrary to the original vision of our Founding Fathers. One group particularly harmed by this overprotectiveness is African Americans. Don’t take my word for it—check out a powerful article by Thomas Sowell in National Review that explores this issue. In the 1960s, when a significant number of Black students first enrolled at a prestigious Ivy League school, a chemistry professor was asked off the record about his approach. He responded, “I give them A’s and B’s. Let them deal with it.” Many of these students had lower entrance standards, and he knew that accurate grading in a difficult class like chemistry could result in many failures—and that would lead to unnecessary conflict from both students and administrators. He wasn’t willing to waste time on what he saw as unproductive drama. He also believed that his leniency was ultimately hurting the students, as they wouldn’t truly grasp the material. Such attitudes were rarely spoken openly then, and they’re even more hidden today. However, many political leaders have benefited from policies that appear helpful but actually hinder long-term progress. Sowell points out how the expansion of the welfare state has led to increased dependency. In 1960, only 22 percent of Black children lived in single-parent households. By 1985, that number had risen to 67 percent. A recent example of this trend is the Obama administration's relaxed discipline policies for Black male students, which have resulted in lower rates of punishment compared to other student groups.

"Charlotte riots have gone completely out of control. The chaos started when a black officer shot a black suspect, turning what was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration into a violent looting frenzy. It’s baffling how they can’t even use the race card here, yet they still destroy neighborhoods for no real reason. Now that the Charlotte rioters have had their moment, they’re gathering around injured officers and mocking them, as if it’s some kind of game. What did that cop do to deserve this? Absolutely nothing. But these people would rather stay on welfare, have kids with no support, and avoid responsibility than do the right thing. Their whole life is dictated by the sound of a gunshot—ding ding! The looting alarm goes off, and all the lazy, angry, and uneducated thugs come out of the woodwork to cause destruction. Why? Because another black man didn’t obey police. That must mean it’s time to riot, loot, and target white people. These fools even attacked a local reporter. They don’t realize that media outlets like CNN often take sides and could be using them for their own agenda. Madworld News reported that rioters surrounded an injured officer and laughed at his pain until backup arrived to help. While they were dealing with that, the violence escalated further, leading to one thug killing another. It's fine with BLM if a black person kills another, but when a cop does it in self-defense, everything explodes. This shows they don’t really care about black lives—they’re just looking for an excuse to act violently. If I saw a cop hurt, I’d try to help. I know if I were down, someone would come to my aid. Black Lives Matter supporters are a disgrace. They're violent, ungrateful, and often raised without guidance. They attack people based on skin color, calling everyone racist just for being white. How can a baby choose the color of its skin? It can’t. But as we grow, we learn to control our actions. I judge people by what they do, not what color they are. Based on what I’ve seen, I say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the nonsense they spread.",1
"The 2016 election is turning into one of the most bizarre and chaotic contests in recent memory. Truth has become fiction, logic has gone out the window, and the usual rules of politics have been thrown aside. When Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination, it marked the end of any semblance of traditional political decorum. And now, the madness is only intensifying, so you might want to start packing your bags. According to a report by The Hill, former President George H.W. Bush is not only refusing to support Trump but is also planning to cast his ballot for Hillary Clinton. This information was shared by Mary Robinson, the former Irish president and daughter of the late Senator Frank McCourt, who revealed the news on Twitter after posting a photo of herself with Bush Sr. alongside the message: “He said he’s voting for Clinton!” This isn’t entirely surprising, given how the Bush family has distanced themselves from Trump, especially after Jeb’s lackluster campaign derailed their political legacy. Neither George H.W. nor George W. Bush attended the Republican National Convention, and Jeb has repeatedly stated he won’t vote for Trump. This move could be seen more as a rejection of Trump than a strong endorsement of Clinton. Earlier this year, Laura Bush made headlines when she subtly expressed her support for Hillary during a speech at a women’s forum. She said, “I hope our next leader—whether male or female—will care about the progress we’ve made for women in Afghanistan and continue the policies we’ve worked so hard to establish.” While George W. Bush had his share of controversies, his father was known for his integrity and loyalty to national interests. This latest development highlights the deep divisions within the Republican Party.

"Well, let's hear it from the horse's mouth. Usually, when a Muslim criticizes the U.S., you might assume they're not truly American. But that wasn't the case with American fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, who made history as the first U.S. Olympian to compete in the hijab. Surprisingly, she’s expressed strong criticisms about the country she represents. As she told The Daily Wire: [I feel targeted] constantly. I’ve been followed by strangers and even accused of wrongdoing by people I don’t know. This happened just last week on 5th Avenue in Manhattan… These experiences are tough, but they don’t compare to the violence we’ve seen in places like Texas or the harsh treatment of the Khan family at the Republican convention. It’s time for real change. How tragic—but let’s not act like we’re living in an “anti-Muslim” nation when hate crimes against Jews are far more common. If she really thinks America is so bad, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim-majority country? I’m sure we all understand—nowhere else do Muslims enjoy the same freedoms as they do here. She won’t be stoned in America. She won’t face genital mutilation. She can drink alcohol openly. And if she were caught stealing, she wouldn’t lose her hand. Compared to what she’d face in some Muslim countries, this seems like a small price to pay.",1
"Scammer-turned-reality-TV-phenomenon-turned-Republican-presidential-candidate Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson last night and launched into a tirade against the U.S. military, a common tactic for a candidate trying to appeal to patriotic conservatives while running for president. During the interview, Trump criticized President Barack Obama and took aim at the military, calling soldiers “the group that can’t hit the target.” In just 14 seconds, Trump used the word “win” or “winning” eight times, without offering any real strategy on how he would achieve these so-called victories.  

“Winning is what I do,” Trump told Carlson. “I’ve always won. I win in business, I win in sports, I win in everything. But our country isn’t winning. We don’t win in trade, we don’t win against ISIS, and we sure don’t win in the Middle East.” He continued, “Imagine if General Patton or General Eisenhower were alive today. They’d be spinning in their graves watching how we fight.”  

Trump also claimed the U.S. had mistakenly bombed Syrian government forces, saying, “We announce we’re sending people over at a certain time, everything’s political, and then we bomb the wrong people. You saw it over the weekend. We killed more than 80 of their troops.”  

At one point, Trump expressed concern that Russia might be upset with the U.S., even though they had been informed beforehand. “Now Russia is furious,” he said. “But we bomb the wrong people. We’re like the group that can’t hit the target.”  

The U.S. later apologized to Russia for the accidental bombing, but Russian officials—eager for a Trump presidency—spread a conspiracy theory blaming the Obama administration for aiding ISIS. Meanwhile, Trump offered no concrete plan to avoid such mistakes, instead repeating the word “win” over and over again. His supporters, of course, lap it up.

"Hillary Clinton made a major gaffe on Wednesday. In a recorded message aimed at American workers, the Democratic presidential candidate revealed a side of herself that many have never seen before! It was exactly what one would expect from the so-called ""queen of chaos""—loud, unhinged and likely to send shivers down the spines of even the most hardened union members. “‘Why aren’t I leading by 60 points?’ you might be wondering,” Hillary shouted with an intensity that could shake a stadium. “The choice for hardworking families has never been clearer. I need your help to expose Donald Trump’s terrible record to the public.” “Don’t be fooled!” she sneered, her voice so piercing that even those with hearing aids couldn’t ignore it. Throughout the video, she kept up that same aggressive tone—focusing not on Trump, but on the very people she was trying to win over. As a result, instead of gaining support, she ended up alienating the very audience she hoped to mobilize. You can watch a short clip below—but be warned, don’t show it to your kids, or they might start fearing a “Hillary monster” under their beds. That’s one scary woman! Does she really think that kind of behavior will help her get elected? Take note of this version of Clinton compared to the polished, friendly image she usually shows in public speeches or interviews. When she's in front of crowds or reporters, she tries (and fails) to come across as warm, approachable and trustworthy. The Clinton in this video is far more in line with the portrait painted by her former security team. For instance, ex-agent Gary Byrne once described her as “unpredictable, volatile and prone to outbursts.” This display certainly matches that description. Byrne even admitted that Clinton often yelled curses at Secret Service agents, White House staff and even her own husband, Bill Clinton. Everyone lived in constant fear of what she might do next. That sounds about right…",1
"Since the Clinton administration, Americans have been fed a narrative that suggests inherited wealth holds more value than money earned through hard work. While Republicans advocate for completely eliminating estate taxes on inherited wealth, Democrats generally oppose this stance. The current agreement is that only estates worth $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are subject to taxation. Anything below that threshold remains entirely tax-free. Now, Joe Biden, under pressure from progressive activists, has updated his approach to the estate tax, and let me tell you, Donald Trump’s children may not be pleased. Earlier, Biden had pledged to return the estate tax to its 2009 levels, increasing the rate from 40% to 45%, and lowering the threshold to $3.5 million. But now, he’s taken a page from his former rival and is proposing a progressive estate tax—meaning it will hit the wealthiest estates even harder—with a top rate of 65%. The last time the estate tax reached this level was in 1981, though back then it applied to smaller inheritances as well. In addition, Biden has indicated he would significantly limit the ""step-up in basis"" rule, which allows heirs to avoid capital gains taxes on assets passed down. In total, the plan is expected to generate roughly $200 billion over the next decade. Source: The New York Times Currently, the estate tax system is a farce. In 2015, a massive $1.4 trillion was transferred through inheritance. Of that, less than 1% was actually taxed. As for the Republican claim that estate taxes harm small businesses, in 2014, only 15 family-owned businesses and farm estates across the country faced estate taxes. Another common Republican argument is that estate taxes represent “double taxation,” but in reality, most large estates consist of untaxed capital gains. Even if Biden wins, passing this reform could be difficult, especially with Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate. He wants Trump’s children to pay nothing in estate taxes. And who knows, maybe Trump himself pays nothing at all.",1
"A suspicious bag was discovered outside a Burger King in Midtown, causing a temporary closure of 46th Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.

"In his final address to the ineffective United Nations Security Council, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah called on Americans to surrender their freedom and submit to global governance. In sharp contrast to Founding Father Thomas Paine, who famously warned, “The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph,” Obama urged the American people to trade liberty for a sense of security. “We can only fulfill this institution’s original mission of ending war through unity if powerful nations like mine accept limitations,” Obama declared. He further stated that “nations with power” must relinquish their independence in order to achieve true safety. “I believe that giving up some freedom in the short term, not our ability to defend ourselves or pursue national interests, but aligning with international agreements will ultimately make us safer,” he said. Naturally, Obama was promoting the United Nations, an organization that is anti-American, anti-Christian, and authoritarian by nature. So, what’s the issue? Is Obama’s word enough for us to follow blindly? Wasn’t he the one who claimed the Affordable Care Act would bring affordable health care to all? Did that happen? No. This man has consistently deceived the public throughout his time in office, and we have the evidence. While Obama, clearly a foreigner based on his own statements, his wife’s declarations, a Kenyan ambassador’s testimony, and the Kenyan Parliament’s records (despite what Trump and others claim), insists his position is correct, he also admits that real Americans, born and raised here, oppose him. These citizens are right to do so. “Sometimes I’m criticized at home for supporting international rules and multilateral systems, but I’m convinced in the long run…” Obama said. “We need to act as we speak.” Yes, but America is not like other nations. She has always been distinct in her history. Her foundation was built on the Bible, not on “international norms,” which originated from pagan influences. That’s what made America great. “I believe we are at a crossroads,” Obama continued after criticizing the construction of a southern border wall. “We can either move forward with a new model of cooperation and integration or retreat into a divided world defined by old lines of nation, tribe, race, and religion. I believe we must move forward, not backward.” While I agree with some level of international collaboration, as George Washington himself suggested, I disagree with how Obama envisions it. His approach rewards bad behavior, encourages",1
"From the “You Can’t Make This Up” Department comes this tale about the latest words that radical leftists are trying to erase from the language due to some overblown sensitivity. Surprisingly, the term “American Pancake Breakfast” has been labeled offensive by a university full of overly cautious administrators. According to Campus Reform, students at California State University were recently asked to rebrand an “American Pancake Breakfast” event after the administration claimed it was “too nationalist.” Emails obtained by Campus Reform reveal that a university official sent a message to student groups encouraging them to co-host the event with campus dorms. What in the world is offensive about a pancake breakfast? I can't imagine. But according to the emails, the administration found the phrase “American” to be “politically charged.” It’s clear that the Left is pushing for total control over language—only the language they approve of.

"One of the most prominent liberal voices in recent history is Senator Elizabeth Warren. She has long been associated with Senator Bernie Sanders, sharing a common progressive vision. However, she remains infamous for her controversial claim of Native American heritage, which she allegedly used to secure scholarships and boost her credentials in academic and professional settings. Conservatives have consistently challenged her on this issue, and many believe she deserves the scrutiny. A young student once confronted her during an event, capturing the exchange on video. When he asked her about her ethnic background, she reportedly became visibly uncomfortable and quickly exited the scene, much like someone caught in a lie. The incident took place at Ohio State University, where Warren was supporting Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland in his campaign for Hillary Clinton. During the event, they urged voters to support Clinton at the state level and work toward a Democratic Senate majority. The student pressed her on her past losses to Donald Trump, but when she insisted they would win, he challenged her again, accusing her of lying about her ethnicity to gain advantages. You could see the tension in her reaction as she left the stage in a hurry. As the saying goes, conservatives don’t take kindly to lies, and liberals often react strongly to the truth. Trump faced criticism for referencing her Native American claim, calling her ""Pocahontas"" in a clear sarcastic tone. But as the old adage goes, what goes around comes around. The truth is hard to ignore, and Warren’s past deception continues to follow her wherever she goes.",1
"The absence of a strong border barrier has led to an influx of illegal narcotics that are destroying communities across the U.S. These drugs have also brought immense wealth to foreign criminal organizations. One of the most notorious figures, El Chapo, was so rich he owned a private wildlife sanctuary. He reportedly imported exotic animals from different countries for his personal enjoyment. This was all funded by the drug trade. Foreign drug cartels are making billions, and their corruption is influencing governments worldwide. It's high time America takes action, and Trump has a unique plan. In a recent speech on immigration, Trump pledged that Mexico would fully fund his proposed border wall. Some suggest that the Mexican drug cartels could be the source of this funding. According to *LifeZette*, a top Trump campaign official hinted that a future Trump administration might use assets seized from drug gangs to pay for the wall. This strategy makes sense — using money from the illegal drug trade to combat illegal border crossings. While a wall isn't the only answer, it serves a critical purpose. The project is estimated to cost $8-10 billion, which could boost economic growth. More importantly, it would reduce the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country. The goal is to encourage people to use the legal immigration process. The plan reportedly includes a ""joint border security fund,"" where assets seized from both sides would be used to build and maintain the wall, benefiting both nations. The Justice Department alone seized $8.7 billion in drug-related funds in 2015, and that’s just what's publicly known. The real amount is likely much higher, not to mention what Mexico has taken. The wall is a direct challenge to drug cartels, which threaten Mexico and have serious consequences for Americans. It addresses corruption, drug trafficking, human smuggling, illegal immigration, and even terrorism all at once. “For years, the illegal drug and weapons trade has devastated lives in both Mexico and the U.S.,” said an anonymous Trump immigration advisor. “It would be a form of justice to take their ill-gotten gains and use them for good.” Trump’s approach is different from Washington’s usual tactics. That kind of thinking is exactly what America needs. H/T Newsmax",1
"In another alarming Islamophobic incident that has become increasingly common across the United States, a man in northeast Philadelphia (near 3rd and Berks streets) is being sought after for throwing a Molotov cocktail into a parked vehicle. Witnesses claim the suspect shouted “that’s for your religion!” before launching what appears to be an improvised incendiary device. The driver of the car suffered serious burns and was taken to the hospital. The growing climate of fear and hostility fueled by figures like Donald Trump and far-right extremists has contributed to a sharp rise in anti-Muslim violence, with reports showing a 72% increase in such incidents following his controversial call for a Muslim ban. These attacks not only deepen divisions but also reinforce the dangerous stereotype that Muslims do not belong in America, creating an environment where extremist ideologies can gain traction. Terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda often exploit this narrative, claiming that the West is inherently hostile to Islam—an idea that these attacks inadvertently validate. In fact, radical recruiters have been known to reference Trump's rhetoric in their propaganda. Former NSA director Keith Alexander warned that statements like “they all hate us” or “we can’t let them in” feed into the very ideology that terrorist organizations promote. While there are no widespread radicalized communities in the U.S., such rhetoric risks fostering them. It is crucial that we reject hate and embrace the values of inclusion and respect that define our nation. Authorities are still looking for the suspect.

"Last night, the American public finally witnessed a rare moment — Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sharing the same stage. And as expected, there was some intense back-and-forth. By the end of the debate, it was clear who came out on top: Hillary Clinton. No one should be shocked. While the media has been hyping up the idea of a ""Trump turnaround,"" the truth is still the same — what we saw was the same old Trump: loud, unprepared, and full of empty rhetoric. The experts know it. The polls know it. The public knows it. Clinton won because she was ready, composed, and articulate. But of course, Trump and his team didn't get the message. They still think they won. Why not? Trump and his allies are blaming Lester Holt for being biased, claiming the microphone was rigged, and saying Clinton was ""over-prepared"" to gain an unfair edge. They’re making excuses again. He was unprepared, disrespectful, and couldn’t even answer basic questions without lying. But let’s focus on why Clinton clearly dominated. Her best line of the night was: “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president.” It's been reported that Clinton spent months studying the issues, doing extensive research, and practicing relentlessly. Trump, however, took a laid-back approach, and it showed. He couldn’t explain his positions, lacked civility, and had no response for Clinton’s facts — only more lies. The bar was low, and Clinton rose above it. She faced a loud, unpredictable, and aggressive opponent, but she stayed calm, challenged him when necessary, and kept her composure. She wasn’t “too loud” as some claimed, but she was firm when needed. And, despite the nonsense, she smiled. One of the main reasons people dislike debates is because moderators often fail to control the conversation. They let candidates dominate, go over time, and interrupt each other endlessly. But this time, Trump was in stark contrast to Clinton. She respected Holt’s time limits and rarely interrupted him to attack Trump. Meanwhile, Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, while she only interrupted him 17 times. At the end, Clinton shook Holt’s hand, and Trump did not. While Trump’s “Crooked Hillary” meme was trending on social media, the facts tell a different story.",1

Now, with video everywhere, it's easier than ever to verify or expose the truth. This is one of the most shocking events I've come across.

Suddenly, someone throws a flaming object at them. FLAMES. THEM. ON. FIRE. They're running around in panic, dangerously close to oncoming traffic. Pure madness and one of the worst things I've seen since the Amanda Knox case. What kind of person would think, ""This is the perfect moment to set them on fire""? Yeah, let's just throw that Molotov their way and watch them burn. Who even carries the materials for a Molotov cocktail? Was this planned? I don't keep those items lying around unless it's for a fancy drink on a Saturday night. Back in the old days, when people were more responsible and society was better, things were handled differently. If two people were about to fight in the street, decent people would step in to protect them from traffic and ensure the fight stayed fair. That was when people had more respect and empathy. Now, everyone pulls out their phone and turns a minor issue into a viral disaster just for views. No one cares anymore. It's time to care about others and stop setting people on fire.",1
"Scroll down for video It's no secret that this election cycle has been filled with division, as topics like immigration, national security, and economic instability have left the American public increasingly frustrated. The institutions we once trusted—our government, media, and judiciary—have been undermined by corruption, self-interest, and a lack of accountability from those in power. While many point fingers at one particular figure, they often ignore the fact that the political establishment itself is deeply complicit in the nation’s decline. Alongside the current occupant of the White House, there's another well-known name in the game—Hillary Clinton, a lifelong politician who now claims to be an outsider, despite her long history of influence and wealth accumulation. Her husband, Bill, has also benefited greatly from the system, using his connections to generate significant income through speaking engagements. Critics argue that the Clinton Foundation, presented as a charitable organization, has functioned more like a financial pipeline for the couple, enabling them to build a vast network of influence. As Secretary of State, Hillary was accused of trading access for donations, while Bill leveraged her position to secure lucrative deals.

"Washington, D.C. (BBC) The Pentagon is exploring a plan that could deploy an extra 400 soldiers to Syria to support Kurdish and local forces in their effort to push ISIS out of Raqqa in the near future, a US military source told the BBC. Reports about potential troop increases have been circulating for weeks, with some outlets covering the possibility. The New York Times was the first to highlight the proposed addition of up to 400 additional personnel. No official decision has been announced, the source said. If approved, this would likely mark the last major troop increase for the operation against ISIS, as Raqqa is considered the final significant ISIS stronghold in Syria, the source added. The move would raise the current limit of US troops in Syria from 3,800 to just over 4,200. A number of additional soldiers are already rotating in and out of the region on temporary assignments. Currently, around 3,650 troops are deployed under the existing cap. The military is not disclosing exactly what roles the new forces would take on. Some are expected to serve as tactical advisors and trainers for Syrian partners, while others may assist with supply lines and movement of equipment across the front lines, the source explained. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed concern over the development. ""We’re hearing about another small boost of 400 troops in Syria, another step toward deeper involvement,"" he stated Thursday.",1

"Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and former police officer, who stopped an ISIS-linked attacker from killing multiple people at a St. Cloud, Minnesota mall, is someone that Hillary Clinton is determined to shut down. If elected president, she plans to take aggressive action against him and his business, which she sees as a threat to her agenda. Falconer, who saved lives by confronting a violent jihadist, runs Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a company that teaches responsible gun ownership and self-defense. This is exactly the kind of organization that Clinton opposes—especially one that promotes Second Amendment rights and trains law-abiding citizens to protect themselves. Clinton has long criticized the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields businesses like Falconer’s from baseless lawsuits. She wants to eliminate this protection, making it easier to target gun training facilities through legal attacks. Falconer, a dedicated defender of public safety, has spent years educating others on how to use firearms responsibly. His actions in St. Cloud have made him a hero to many, but to Clinton, he’s a dangerous symbol of the very freedoms she seeks to undermine. If she gets into office, she’ll do everything she can to silence men like him. Don’t vote for Hillary Clinton—she doesn’t just want to control guns; she wants to control the people who protect us.",1
"You may have come across slogans like, “Disagree with abortion? Don’t get one!” During the era of slavery in this country, a similar message might have been, “Don’t like slavery? Don’t own slaves!” Supporters claim that abortion doesn’t impact most people, so others shouldn’t interfere. It’s considered a private matter between a woman and her healthcare provider. They argue that pro-life advocates shouldn’t impose their beliefs on others through laws that force women to carry pregnancies against their will. After all, the issue only directly affects the woman and the unborn child, who, of course, has no voice in the matter. (Though the child is not technically part of the woman’s body.) You could apply the same reasoning to slavery. It only affected the slave owner and the enslaved person, but at the time, slaves weren’t seen as full human beings—similar to how some view unborn children today. So, if you opposed slavery, that’s fine, but don’t force your views on others. In fact, one activist and leader of an abortion advocacy group has drawn a parallel between abortion and slavery. She argues that denying federal support for abortion is like enforcing slavery, while allowing it is about “liberating women.” According to CNS News, Kierra Johnson, executive director of URGE: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, recently spoke before the House Judiciary Committee discussing the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape or incest. She compared the amendment to slavery, stating that repealing it would be a step toward “freedom” for women. When asked about the effect of the Hyde Amendment on low-income women, Johnson referenced a previous comment from Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who likened the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision to abortion, saying, “When you control someone’s decision-making, you control them.” “The Hyde Amendment is about expanding access to reproductive care,” she said. “It’s about giving women control over their bodies. It’s about freedom.” “When you decide whether a person’s body has worth, you’re essentially owning them—whether you label them as black or not. You don’t get to make that call,” she added. “We are valuable, and we deserve autonomy. The Hyde Amendment is about setting us free.” “We aren’t naive. We aren’t being tricked. Most women who choose abortion are already parents. They care about their",1

"In a highly charged interview on Fox News, Trump was confronted about labeling Hillary Clinton as a ""racist."" When pressed for specific reasoning, he struggled to articulate his claims and attempted to shift the conversation, which only made him appear more defensive. Here's part of the exchange:  
Anderson Cooper: You've called Hillary Clinton a racist. What makes her a racist?  
Trump: Well, she's a racist.  
Anderson Cooper: But what specifically makes her racist? Racism involves prejudice against a particular race.

Anderson Cooper: But you said her policies are ""personally racist.""  
Trump: Oh, she is. Of course she is. There's no question about that.

"The government’s response to every broken policy or underperforming agency is to pour more taxpayer dollars into it. Since public education became widespread, students have become less informed and more dependent. Yet, supporters of big government insist the issue is simply a lack of funding. So they throw more money at it, and the problems only worsen. Since the beginning of the War on Drugs, over $1.5 trillion has been spent, yet drug use remains steady or even increases. Instead of rethinking the strategy or addressing constitutional concerns, officials keep throwing money at the problem, hoping it will finally end illegal drug use. But it never does. The same pattern repeats with the “War on Terror.” The U.S. has invested $5 trillion into it, and terrorism has grown exponentially. Rather than questioning our foreign interventions—especially in the Middle East—the answer from politicians is to expand military efforts and continue pouring money into the conflict. And terrorism keeps spreading. According to a report by Dr. Neta Crawford from Brown University, U.S. spending on defense, state, homeland security, and veterans since 9/11 has reached nearly $5 trillion. Before we ask how a nation with over $19.3 trillion in debt can afford such massive war spending, the real question is: What has this money actually accomplished? As Reader Supported News pointed out last year, terrorism has surged by 6,500% since 2002 (perhaps it should be called the ""War of Terror"" instead). In 2014, it was reported that 74% of terror-related deaths occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As noted by Paul Gottinger, only Nigeria wasn’t directly affected by U.S. air strikes or military presence that year. However, U.S. involvement in Nigeria has been significant for years. Why wouldn’t it be? Nigeria used to be Africa's top oil producer and largest economy until recently. Ben Swann revealed a shocking fact: ""Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, there were zero suicide attacks in Iraq. None in the country’s history. But since the war began, there have been 1,892."" In Iraq, before the war, there were over 1.5 million Christians. After the invasion, more than a million fled to Syria. Today, fewer than half a million remain, facing threats from groups like ISIS.

"A top Trump ally in Silicon Valley is now facing a major federal investigation over alleged racial bias in its hiring practices. The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Palantir Technologies, the data firm backed by Republican investor Peter Thiel, accusing the company of systematically excluding Asian applicants during its recruitment process. Palantir, which works with the U.S. intelligence community, is under scrutiny after a review of its engineering intern hiring showed a stark disparity. According to the lawsuit, 73% of applicants were Asian, yet only four Asians were hired compared to 17 non-Asians.

Thiel, a Stanford graduate and early Facebook investor, has long been a quiet but influential figure in tech circles. He gained more public attention this year when he was revealed as the secret financial backer of Hulk Hogan’s defamation lawsuit against Gawker, which ultimately led to the site’s collapse. Thiel also made headlines at the Republican National Convention when he became the first openly gay speaker to address the convention, declaring his pride in both his sexuality and his political affiliation. However, his party’s recent platform, which includes some of the most anti-LGBT policies in its history, has raised questions about the alignment between Thiel’s personal views and the GOP's stance.

"I witnessed both incidents involving black men being shot recently and I want to share my take on each. The shooting in Tulsa, where I'm from, is being labeled as a white cop killing an innocent black man. That's not exactly accurate. Terence Crutcher had a long criminal record, with at least 12 prior arrests. Officers found PCP in his stalled car. What the media is saying is that he was just standing by his vehicle when the bad cops showed up and shot him with his hands in the air. He was indeed unarmed, but according to the video, he kept walking with his arms raised after being told multiple times to stop. He finally reached his car and started to reach inside. That’s when a white female officer shot him. His lawyer claims the window was closed when she arrived, but it seems clear he was trying to get something from the car. Two officers fired at the same time—one with a taser and one with a gun. It was a justified use of force—he wasn’t shot while his hands were up. From what I saw, the officer followed protocol. Should she have waited to see if he pulled a weapon and shot first? No, that’s not how they’re trained. He wasn’t obeying orders and looked high. Hundreds turned out in Tulsa last night for protests—again, Black Lives Matter. At first, people said he was a preacher, which isn’t true. He was a criminal, and the officers acted in self-defense. Now, moving on to North Carolina, where another black man was shot and killed—this time by a black officer.  

From Gateway Pundit: Protests erupted in Charlotte after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer. The man was reportedly shot by a black officer. Demonstrators attacked police, threw a rock at a reporter, and vandalized a cruiser. The incident happened around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex. According to WBTV, officers were looking for someone with an outstanding warrant when they spotted a man exiting a vehicle with a gun. Scott got out of the car ""armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat,"" leading officers to shoot him. Black Lives Matter activists gathered to protest, throwing water bottles at the police. Twelve officers were injured as hundreds of BLM protesters rioted and looted after Scott was killed. His daughter shared a video claiming he was innocent—",1
"Anyone who has battled with a dependency knows how hard it is to break free. Whether it's alcohol, cigarettes, opioids, or something else, achieving even 24 hours of sobriety can feel like a major victory. A man, once addicted to meth, shared on Reddit what happened when he finally decided to take control of his life and escape the grip of his addiction. The transformation is undeniable. Addiction isn't just a physical struggle—it affects your mind, emotions, and spirit. Staying sober is difficult for that reason, but it’s essential for the health of the person and those around them.  

The man in question fell into meth addiction after a series of personal setbacks, including the loss of his job and a broken relationship. After years of relapse and failed attempts at recovery, he finally made the decision to get help. He was sentenced to 14 days in jail for violating his probation before entering a rehabilitation program. As seen in his arrest photo, he was clearly suffering from both the physical and emotional toll of his addiction.  

When he finally committed to recovery, everything changed. His ""after"" picture shows him 615 days clean and still going strong. In his Reddit post, he wrote: “There are people out there who are still stuck in the same place I was. If even one of them sees this and decides to change, then it’s all worth it.” If you or someone you care about is dealing with addiction, remember that reaching out for help is not an invasion of privacy. It may be hard to hear at first, but in time, they’ll understand that you were trying to help. No one should have to suffer from addiction any longer than necessary.",1
"On Tuesday, Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL) took to Twitter to reference the arrest of the main suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as a way to subtly criticize NFL quarterback Tom Brady, in what many saw as a poorly timed and tone-deaf attempt to link his recent kneeling protests with domestic terrorism. Gaetz tweeted, “You’re welcome,” following news that Tsarnaev had been apprehended, clearly aiming to imply that Brady should be grateful for law enforcement’s actions. However, the online reaction was swift and harsh, with the tweet quickly being labeled as “Thanks, Brady” — a nod to the infamous “Thanks, Obama” meme used by liberals to mock conservative attempts to tie unrelated events to presidential policies. Just like “Thanks, Obama,” the phrase “You’re welcome, Brady” now serves as a punchline for how far some on the right will go to twist public sentiment against athletes speaking out on social issues. The tweet gained traction on multiple verified accounts, including reaching prominent media figures like Anderson Cooper. In the end, it’s clear this was not the political maneuver Gaetz had envisioned, and many are hoping he takes the lesson to heart — and stops using national tragedies to boost his own image.",1
"Animals act more civilized than this. Following the fatal shooting of a black man by a black police officer, tensions exploded in Charlotte, North Carolina. While last night saw a relative calm, the first two nights were marked by extreme violence. A protester was killed when another fired into the crowd, striking him in the head. Dozens of officers and demonstrators were injured, with protesters hurling bricks, bottles, and debris at law enforcement. Police responded with tear gas, pepper spray, and flashbangs, turning the streets into a battlefield. The conflict began after the suspect's family spread a false narrative claiming he was unarmed and reading a book while waiting for his son. No book was found, but a gun was. The man exited his car with a weapon drawn from a holster, then returned to his vehicle before exiting again with the gun. An officer shot him after he refused to drop the weapon. His family fueled the unrest, as did a Muslim spokesperson who supported them. They should be held accountable.  

From The Federalist Papers Project: Robert Gehl reported that during the second night of riots in Charlotte, demonstrators attempted to throw a journalist into a fire they had lit in the middle of the street. Local station WCCB tweeted that its reporters saw “protesters” trying to burn the photographer alive. The claim was later echoed by Marvin Beach, a WCCB reporter during their live stream. Beach stated that the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. As The Daily Caller noted, it remains unclear why the attempt failed, but the livestream later showed police helping the unnamed photographer, who appeared unharmed. The photographer was white, leading to speculation that he was targeted due to his race—there have been numerous racially motivated incidents during the two-day chaos. One of the most disturbing acts occurred when a white photographer was seized by Black Lives Matter activists who tried to throw him into a fire. He escaped without serious injury, but the incident highlights the growing danger. A statement from reporter Marvin Beach on WCCB’s livestream confirmed the photographer witnessed the attack. It’s uncertain why the plan failed, but the footage showed police rescuing the man. What kind of people would do this based solely on race? They are perpetuating the very violence they claim to oppose. This can’t continue without worse consequences. This is what you’ve asked for, America.",1
"With two more attacks—this time a bombing and a stabbing—occurring within a 10-hour period, the nation has once again been reminded that we are under threat from both domestic extremism and the dangerous influence of radical ideologies. As expected, the two presidential contenders issued statements on the incidents. However, only one of them managed to spark widespread attention—not for the content of their remarks, but for the way they were delivered. During a press briefing following a bombing in Chicago, Hillary Clinton again targeted Donald Trump, but observers and journalists began questioning whether she was speaking under the influence of something unusual. Her tone was unusually calm, almost lethargic, and she appeared disoriented, as if struggling to stay awake. Speaking to the press pool that follows her campaign, she said, “I’ve been informed about the bombing in Chicago and the stabbing in Ohio. We must do everything possible to support our first responders, and I’ll have more to say once we have the full facts.” When asked about Trump’s response, she replied, “It’s essential to rely on the facts when dealing with events like these. That’s why we need to support the investigators who are working to uncover the truth. It’s better to wait for solid information before making any judgments.” The clip quickly went viral online, with many people speculating that Clinton was either medicated or simply too exhausted to engage properly. Some called it unbecoming of a candidate. Is she being heavily sedated?

"Legendary athlete LeBron James released a public statement addressing the ongoing issues of racial injustice and police relations. James said, “As an American father and someone who has seen the pain of violence firsthand, I am deeply concerned about the tragic deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement. At the same time, I’m also upset by the attacks on officers who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe. I stand with the families who have lost loved ones, because I understand that pain all too well.” He continued, “My parents always taught me to treat everyone with respect, no matter where they come from. That’s why I’m troubled by the growing division and hostility in our country. I believe we can do better, and I can’t stay quiet any longer. We need to create real change that ensures people of color are treated fairly and that police officers—those who protect us daily—are respected and supported.” James also highlighted his appreciation for law enforcement, sharing personal stories of how officers have helped him and his family over the years. However, he acknowledged that many African Americans have had negative experiences with police and don’t feel the same sense of safety. His most powerful message was a call for unity and collaboration to bring about real reform. In a bold move, James announced he would be donating $1 million each to two organizations: the National Police Foundation and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. While he admitted that money alone won’t fix everything, he hoped it would help these groups make meaningful progress. Social media quickly responded with backlash, with some calling him a sellout and questioning the impact of his donation. But what he said was incredibly significant. Not only did he recognize the systemic issues facing Black communities, but he also validated the challenges faced by law enforcement. He managed to speak from both perspectives, showing true understanding. And he backed his words with action, giving a substantial amount of his own resources. A rare example of someone who not only speaks but acts. Too often, people talk without taking real steps. He did just that. Unlike others who remain silent or take sides without offering support. He is able to bridge the gap, and as an African American leader, his voice carries more weight. It’s the voices of our own that tend to resonate most. Whether we admit it or not, many Black people are more likely to listen to someone who looks like them. That’s why his message matters so much.",1
"When Republicans chose a candidate who pledged to stop catering to the wealthy for political favors, few anticipated that their presidential nominee would hand over control of America’s most powerful offices directly to the same elite class. Reports suggest that Donald Trump is considering naming energy magnate Rebecca Hart as Secretary of the Interior, a move that breaks from the tradition of appointing officials from the rural Western states to oversee the management of public lands, national parks, and wildlife. This could be disastrous for environmental protections, the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, and animal welfare, as Rebecca Hart has a long history of opposing animal rights legislation and supporting industries that exploit animals for entertainment. According to a recent article in The Hill, Hart, who owns a large ranch and sits on Trump’s agricultural advisory board, has donated heavily to organizations that oppose the Humane Society and PETA, while promoting hunting, factory farming, and rodeo events. A source familiar with the transition team confirmed that Hart was among a small group of candidates under consideration for the role, which has drawn attention from influential anti-environmental figures. In a clear sign of the cronyism Trump plans to institutionalize, it was also reported that his daughter Ivanka is being seriously considered for a top position in the administration. The Department of the Interior controls 28% of the nation's land, oversees national parks and forests, manages the federal Fish & Wildlife Service, and plays a key role in regulating tribal gaming operations. It also holds significant influence over mineral leasing and drilling on public lands, making it a critical player for the energy sector. The Natural Resources Defense Council issued a dire warning about the implications of Trump’s potential appointment: “Putting an energy mogul in charge of our public lands and coastal areas is a direct threat to the environment and a promise that Trump will open up every protected area to oil drilling if he wins.” Hart is known for her fierce opposition to animal protection laws, having actively worked against a Missouri ballot initiative in 2012 that aimed to end cruel puppy mill practices. It’s alarming to see how Trump is offering high-level government positions in ways that seem almost absurd. If the only options are a corporate oil executive who will exploit the country’s natural resources without restraint and supports animal cruelty as part of his platform or a privileged, far-right figure who takes joy in hunting endangered species with high-powered rifles, one might wonder if this is all scripted. But Trump is not joking — and the danger he represents is very real",1
"Hillary has been the target of another cringe-worthy moment lately. At a recent campaign event, a man shouted, “Hillary for jail!” to which she responded, “Let’s make it happen!” The crowd was stunned, and the internet quickly picked up on the awkward exchange. Many believe she misheard the comment, thinking it was something like “Hillary for president!”—a common occurrence these days. It's both ridiculous and sad. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren also fell victim to a prank at a different event. She took a selfie with a young man who claimed to be a supporter, only to be shocked when he accused her of lying about her heritage. He also claimed Hillary would lose to Trump, sparking an uncomfortable conversation that left Warren visibly flustered. The incident only added to the growing list of embarrassing moments for Democratic candidates. (Photo: Getty) From InfoWars: During a rally, a protester yelled “Hillary for jail!” and Clinton replied, “Let’s make it happen!” The video went viral, highlighting her growing reputation for confusion. The “Hillary for jail” slogan has been circulating for years, fueled by public frustration over her alleged misconduct. It has become a popular catchphrase among Trump supporters, who see it as a reflection of her supposed corruption. The phrase “Hillary for Jail 2016” has taken on a life of its own, even among those who don’t fully support Trump. Clinton’s team admits she’s struggled with scandals and health concerns, while Trump continues to gain momentum. With rising fears of terrorism and strong backing from law enforcement, Trump’s lead in the polls shows no sign of shrinking. Clinton appears weak and damaged, and if the country faces more attacks, many may turn to a strong leader like Trump. The nation is shifting, and not in a good way. Be warned—what you ask for, you may just get.",1
"Fox News host Sean Hannity made a strong attempt on Tuesday to paint Terence Crutcher as a dangerous criminal, only to be challenged by a Tulsa news reporter who presented factual evidence contradicting his claims. Crutcher was fatally shot by white police officer Betty Shelby despite having his hands raised and being surrounded by multiple officers. The incident was captured on video, showing that the unarmed man posed no threat to the officers present. In fact, police have often detained armed white suspects without using lethal force. However, Hannity insisted during his radio segment that Crutcher had a history of violence and outstanding warrants. “I’ve heard that Mr. Crutcher has a long criminal record and was possibly under the influence at the time,” Hannity stated, which led Tulsa journalist Sarah Johnson to counter with verified information. “I checked his record and I don’t see any violent offenses,” Johnson said. “There was a civil protection order from over a decade ago that was dropped, and some minor financial issues, but nothing indicating he was a danger to anyone.” Hannity then claimed there were active warrants for Crutcher’s arrest, but Johnson clarified that no such warrants existed. “I haven’t seen any reports or evidence of that,” she said. “This seems like misinformation being spread.” Frustrated, Hannity suggested he had an inside source and said the information would eventually come out. Here’s the clip via Media Matters: Once again, Hannity tried to deflect attention from a fatal police shooting by attacking the victim’s character. The truth remains that Crutcher was unarmed, had his hands up, and was killed by officers who had no justification for using deadly force. Officer Shelby should face serious charges for this senseless killing.",1
"New Jersey’s controversial Republican Governor Chris Christie is facing intense scrutiny as top state lawmakers are considering initiating impeachment proceedings if he is found responsible for orchestrating the closure of the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a political opponent. A court has ordered Christie to release personal emails connected to the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, according to WNYC. The decision to move forward with impeachment rests with Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, and if approved, the Judiciary Committee would begin the formal process. A simple majority of the 80-member Assembly would be required to approve articles of impeachment. If passed, the case would then go to the Senate, where a two-thirds vote would be needed for conviction. While Democrats hold the majority in the Senate, they would need support from at least three Republicans to secure a conviction. Christie also serves as a key advisor on Donald Trump’s presidential transition team. Just days ago, federal prosecutors accused Christie of being deeply involved in the scheme that led to the bridge closure, which caused severe traffic chaos and delayed emergency services, resulting in one death. Christie had been seen as a major conservative voice and the first high-profile Republican to back Trump, a move that many believed signaled the end of his political future, as his career now seemed tied to Trump's success. From entertaining presidential ambitions to endorsing Trump in a widely criticized event last March, it was seen as a major fall from grace. Christie once famously lied for over two hours during a televised press conference, which you can watch below, starting at 1:43. In it, he flatly denied any knowledge of BridgeGate, just two months after re-election and four months after the incident that caused massive gridlock and emergency delays. It was later revealed that Christie had been personally informed about the bridge closure during the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 by his aides, yet he remained silent. His aides later confronted him in emails, accusing him of lying to the public. Once viewed as a rising star in the Republican Party, Christie now faces potential removal from office due to his alleged role in a politically motivated act of retaliation. We will continue to monitor this story and see how Donald Trump responds to the impeachment charges against the New Jersey Governor, who remains a central figure in the Republican presidential campaign. Watch his downfall:",1
"I’m probably heading to a place where people will think I’m crazy for laughing at this, but I can’t stop—it’s just too ridiculous! There’s been a wild rumor going around that Barack Obama is actually an alien posing as a human. At first glance, it sounds completely insane, but consider this: he once said he was “out of this world.” That’s not exactly the kind of phrase someone uses when they’re just feeling tired or distracted. And then there's this piece of “evidence” that’s been circulating online: A man shouts directly at Obama, “OBAMA TO THE MOON!” Obama replies, “Let’s make it happen!” I’ve never been to space, so I can’t say for sure, but it doesn’t sound like something you’d be thrilled to do. If that doesn’t make you laugh until you cry, check out this screenshot:

"Just like Barack Obama and many in his circle, Hillary Clinton and her team have always managed to avoid proper security screenings. There are likely more terrorists with spotless records than these individuals, and that’s not an exaggeration. They shouldn’t even be trusted with a broom. The Daily Caller News Foundation has been pushing the State Department for years to release documents proving whether Clinton and her top advisors completed required security training, briefings, or courses. These people aren’t just ignorant about security—they actively refuse to learn what they’re supposed to know. This is known as deniable plausibility. TheDCNF filed a FOIA lawsuit to force the release of these records, and a federal judge recently ordered the State Department to begin producing them. Will they actually comply before the election? A judge has told them to—don’t count on it.  

From The Daily Caller: A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to start releasing hundreds of documents within five days regarding whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her senior aides completed mandatory security training, briefings, or courses. Judge Richard Leon ruled in favor of TheDCNF by rejecting the State Department’s attempt to dismiss the FOIA lawsuit. However, he also denied the request to depose officials. The State Department has failed to provide any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received annual security briefings on handling classified information and secure communications.  

In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF is seeking the same records for her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Huma Abedin, in particular, raises serious security concerns. Yet, as usual, the department hasn’t complied with any requests, and there’s no sign that will change this time. Meanwhile, the rest of us face real consequences for similar infractions. It seems we just aren’t the “right people.”  

Judge Leon is growing increasingly impatient with the State Department’s delays. He ordered the release of one-third of the 400 documents by September 26th and the remaining by October 10th. Bradley Moss, an attorney for TheDCNF, said, “Judge Leon’s order clearly shows his frustration with the State Department’s ongoing obstruction of the FOIA process. They’ll either meet the deadline or face the consequences.” I hope they finally follow through this time. It’s getting old—just talking about accountability while letting them off the hook.

"I watched both shootings of black men unfold yesterday and I have a few things to share about each one today. The incident in Tulsa, where I'm from, is being painted as a white cop killing an innocent black man. That's not exactly the case.

The man was reportedly shot by a black officer. Demonstrators attacked police, threw a rock at a reporter, and smashed a police car. The shooting happened around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte.

"An independent examiner has concluded that 14-year-old Jordan Reyes, an African-American boy who was fatally shot by police in Cincinnati, OH last Tuesday, was “more likely than not” fleeing from officers when he was struck. This finding challenges the official police account, which claims Reyes was shot during a confrontation after “he pulled a realistic BB gun on officers.” Reyes was killed at 8:15 pm following a report of a small theft involving a group of three African-American teenagers. According to the police department's statement, “officers pursued the suspects into a parking lot and attempted to detain them when one individual pulled a weapon from his jacket. An officer fired and hit the suspect multiple times.” The city’s medical examiner has completed the autopsy, but results will remain confidential for at least six weeks. This delay led Reyes’ family to hire Dr. Lillian Carter, a forensic pathologist from Boston University and a consultant with the Massachusetts Medical Examiner’s Office. In a statement released by the family’s legal team, Carter stated, “Based on the trajectory of the wounds, it is more likely than not that Jordan Reyes was running away from the officers at the time of the shooting.” While it is clear that Reyes was involved in the theft—his friend Jamal Cole, 18, who was also present and has since been arrested, confirmed that Reyes “wanted to steal something to buy food”—Carter’s findings have raised concerns about the use of excessive force. Many in the community believe the narrative that Reyes was pointing a weapon at the police was fabricated to justify the shooting. Cole’s earlier testimony before the investigation was released also contradicted the official story. He told a local news outlet, “We were told to drop to the ground, and we did. But Jordan got up and started running, and then the cop shot him.” It's important to remember that stealing a few dollars doesn’t warrant a death sentence in this country. While some may argue that the boy deserved what he got for committing a crime, it's worth considering that when white youths are convicted of serious offenses, like sexual assault, they often receive lighter sentences, sometimes even probation. But when African-American youths are involved, they are often labeled as dangerous and met with lethal force. The Reyes case is part of a troubling pattern of deadly interactions between young Black men and law enforcement, many of which involve BB guns that closely resemble real firearms. Given how common both BB guns and real guns are among white",1
"President Obama is often celebrated for his impact on African American communities. He frequently highlights his upbringing on the south side of Chicago as a symbol of overcoming adversity. However, many are now questioning this narrative, pointing out that he actually spent significant parts of his childhood in Indonesia and Kenya. While he claims his presidency has helped bridge racial divides, tensions continue to rise across cities like Ferguson, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Cleveland. The Democratic Party has long relied on support from African Americans, women, and Hispanic voters, consistently targeting these groups during campaigns. Yet not all members of these communities agree with the party's stance. Some are now voicing their frustrations online, criticizing Obama's leadership and legacy.

As Trump put it, Obama is more concerned with his image than with the people he's supposed to represent. Watch the clip here. Other users pointed to rising violence and unrest as evidence of his failed policies. Some criticized his decision to block a bill allowing 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia.

"Throughout much of the presidential race, the physical condition of Republican candidate Donald Trump has remained a subject of intense public scrutiny, particularly due to his frequent coughing spells and moments of apparent disorientation, which reached a peak during his speech at the Veterans Day ceremony last month. As the first presidential debate approaches at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, Trump’s campaign is reportedly concerned about the debate rules recently announced by the commission, which could potentially put him at a disadvantage. According to a report from The Gateway Pundit, an anonymous insider within the commission confirmed that the 90-minute debate will have no scheduled breaks, even if Trump experiences a sudden health issue on stage. “No commercial breaks, no interruptions,” the source said. Additionally, moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN has been instructed not to cut away from the stage or adjust the audio if Trump shows any signs of distress, leaving him fully exposed to the eyes of millions of viewers. In other news, the commission also rejected a request from Trump’s team for a platform to stand on during the debate, citing concerns over fairness. While Trump is known to be around 6'2"", his opponent, Joe Biden, stands at 6'1"", making the height difference minimal. However, the commission agreed to provide a custom podium for Biden to ensure a more balanced appearance. Some speculate that Trump’s team may need to rely on his regular medication regimen to avoid another episode of fatigue or confusion during the debate, which could damage his chances of securing the presidency.

"It would be naive to assume that every firefighter is a selfless hero. Like any job, there are plenty of hardworking individuals and, unfortunately, some who fall short of the standards expected. Firefighters are human beings, and sometimes they make errors, or worse, act with poor judgment. That said, in a profession where people risk their lives daily to save others, I believe the overwhelming majority of firefighters in America are committed professionals who deserve respect and should not be subjected to constant scrutiny for split-second decisions made under extreme pressure. But don’t tell that to the Progressive Legislative Group… This group is pushing for a radicalized and openly biased Attorney General Loretta Lynch to take action against firefighters, aiming to prevent them from using force against individuals who threaten their safety. Naturally, they don’t present it quite that way, but the underlying goal remains clear. Citing recent high-profile incidents involving armed individuals threatening firefighters, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, delivered a fiery statement outside the Justice Department while the media eagerly recorded her words. “The public is watching, and we can’t keep turning a blind eye to these tragedies,” she proclaimed, with her allies cheering in agreement. The letter calls on Lynch to “intensify investigations, bring charges, and prosecute any and all firefighters who injure or kill unarmed individuals.” At first glance, this seems fair… if those individuals are truly innocent. However, in many of these cases, the initial story about the victim’s actions often contradicts the facts that come out later, once left-leaning activists and their media allies have already crafted a misleading narrative to fit their agenda.",1
"Let’s just put it this way: If Donald Trump’s team was caught breaking the law, the media would be quick to declare his downfall and paint him as a corrupt leader, ready to be dragged out of the spotlight. But with Hillary Clinton, the press seems to look the other way. Not sure what I mean? Let me explain. The group HillaryForAmerica, which promotes Clinton's agenda, was recruiting volunteers to go to voter registration centers and influence voters. There are two major issues here. First, it's against the law to approach people at polling or registration sites and tell them who to vote for. That’s why candidates aren’t allowed to engage directly with voters at those locations—despite Bill Clinton doing it repeatedly and the media ignoring it. This looks like a textbook case of election interference. Second, the organizers of HillaryForAmerica had no idea that one of their trainees was secretly recording the whole thing, capturing them in the act of encouraging illegal behavior. Here's the full video. If this doesn’t make you question the integrity of Clinton supporters, nothing will.

When confronted about her bias, she immediately fled the scene, realizing she was being recorded. It all sounds too familiar, doesn’t it? We must show up at the polls to stop this kind of political deception once and for all. Who’s with me? (Source: YouTube, Twitter)",1
"Watch this creep punch out two tough-looking women in a diner (video below), then we’ll have a deep conversation about it later. Maybe some beer and snacks, but that’s not the point. So the scrawny guy in the tank top, how fitting, was arguing with the two girls who looked like the kind of ladies a black man would go for. You know, big hips, messy hair, and questionable life choices. They’re all going at it like it’s a street fight, and you know it’s only a matter of time before someone gets knocked out and ends up on a viral page. Finally, someone says something, and it looks like a drink gets thrown, glass breaks, and chaos ensues instead of people enjoying their fries and coffee. If *Soul Train* was a brawl in a café, this would be it. If *Fight Club* had women, this would be it. I’m just here for the drama, watching a black man take down a couple of rough girls. He lands a solid punch on one of them, and the other one just disappears into the fray. I see red shirts flying, hair getting pulled, cheap tattoos showing, and I was actually hoping a boob didn’t pop out as I laughed at this terrible video. Normally, I don’t mind a little peek during a girl fight, but these girls are not my type. Not at all. After a few rounds of punches and kicks, the guy has now attacked two women. They’re not attractive, but that doesn’t justify hitting a woman. If he were a real man, he would’ve walked away with his pride instead of knocking them out cold. Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorable, but she should show this video at her next event if she’s not too weak to press play. If anything is truly deplorable, it’s a man attacking two women. Hopefully, they all get taken into custody. And if you missed it, there was a quick shot of the waitress and a really bad butt crack from the woman in the red shirt. I don’t want my breakfast ruined by this nonsense. Do you? If you really need to be disturbed, imagine what would happen if this guy showed up to a real fight. What on earth is this guy? Don’t worry, that’s a man. You can look at him and not feel like a fake transgender person in a store restroom. Strange, I know.",1
"Federal prosecutors launched the first ""Bridgegate"" criminal trial, focusing their most serious charges on New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, even as his two top aides are the ones currently on trial. At least one fatality has been linked to the Bridgegate scandal by some news outlets. Although Christie is not a defendant in this particular court session, the aggressive stance from prosecutors suggests they may still view him as the central figure in their three-year investigation, as reported by NJ.com: U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna described the chaos caused by the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee starting on Sept. 9, 2013, and stated that David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official who pleaded guilty last year, will admit he was the mastermind behind the plan. The prosecutor noted that Wildstein will testify that he and Baroni informed Christie about the scheme at the exact moment the traffic gridlock occurred during a Sept. 11 memorial event in Manhattan. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so determined to retaliate against Mayor Sokolich that, during those critical minutes they had alone with the governor, they boasted about the traffic problems in Fort Lee and the fact that the mayor wasn’t getting through on his calls,” said Khanna. “This case is about the defendants’ abuse of power and their indifference to the people of Fort Lee,” he added. Last year, Trump accused Christie of being involved in Bridgegate, but after the former prosecutor defeated Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged unwavering support to the president, the two Republicans have grown very close, likely bonded over shared meals at McDonald’s. Federal prosecutors are now seeking convictions against Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie’s former deputy chief of staff. The only point all sides agree on is that Christie knew about his subordinates’ political retaliation against a local mayor. Defense attorneys argue that the George Washington Bridge closure, now known as BridgeGate, was covered up to protect Christie’s rising political career, as he was already planning for a presidential run in 2013. Defense lawyers have long claimed that Christie and his senior advisers were aware of the lane closures and ordered the cover-up to shield the governor’s ambitions — calling their clients “thrown under the bus,” as one attorney put it. But this is the first time a prosecutor has directly implicated Christie. It also contradicts the governor’s statements over",1
"Hillary Clinton’s health has become a major focus in the Presidential race. What was once dismissed as a ""wild theory"" is now gaining attention, as more people claim she suffers from severe medical conditions, including cognitive impairments. Following her recent fall and hospitalization, even some of her supporters are beginning to question what they see. Now, analyst Mike Rourke (below) presents a shocking new take on Hillary Clinton's condition, one that has never been discussed before. He suggests that Hillary is no longer alive and has been replaced by multiple look-alikes and digital projections. If this is true, it would be the most elaborate political deception ever seen. What a revelation!: As reported by InfoWars: Note: Russian intelligence is using my footage to show that they used a green screen during a recent appearance in Greensboro! It's all fabricated, folks! You can watch my video below. According to Russian sources, Hillary hasn’t left her daughter’s home and is being represented by stand-ins! Also, check out the segment where Russia reveals emails suggesting Hillary was seriously injured in a hidden plane crash! Initially, they mocked Sorcha Faal’s claims, but now they’re calling it “plausible.” Important details here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan covered the crash when it occurred!

"Back in August, after arriving an hour late to her first campaign event in Nevada, Hillary was questioned by Ed Hendy, who said, “The FBI believes you tried to wipe the entire server. Did you try to wipe the entire…so there could be no email—no personal, no official; wipe the whole thing?” Hillary seemed confused, taking the question at face value, and asked, “Like with a cloth or something?” I believe she was faking, as she had previously used BleachBit to erase her emails, a program so effective that “even God can’t find them,” according to Trey Gowdy during a committee session. He called it “more evidence that Clinton had something to hide when she deleted personal emails from her private server while Secretary of State.” Considering Hillary’s long history of deception, I’m not surprised. Recently, we’ve found clear evidence that Hillary looked into methods for permanently deleting emails without a trace. Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who helped Clinton remove data from her server, posted online seeking guidance on how to commit the act. Although Combetta invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a congressional hearing, he was very open when asking other IT professionals how to fabricate Clinton's emails.

"There have been growing concerns from *The New York Times* that Megyn Kelly, the moderator of the recent presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, will not be challenging the candidates on their factual claims. This means that Trump could make false statements without immediate correction — leaving it up to Biden to counter them on the spot. However, the situation is even more troubling, as all major news networks (including those typically critical of Trump) have agreed to avoid any real-time fact checks during the debate. While on-screen fact checks could help clarify misleading statements without disrupting the flow, most major networks, including CNN and MSNBC, have confirmed they will not display any such graphics or corrections. As a result, the responsibility of holding the candidates accountable may fall entirely on Kelly, the only other person on stage. With reports showing that Trump has been caught in falsehoods roughly every four minutes, one would expect a strong fact-checking presence to ensure a fair debate. Instead, the media, prioritizing ratings over truth, appears willing to let Trump dominate without pushback. The Biden campaign has strongly criticized this approach, with Senior Advisor Jen O’Malley Dillon stating: “If the moderator allows lies to go unchallenged, it gives Trump an unfair edge. It’s the moderator’s job to call out dishonesty in real time.” Unfortunately, with no independent oversight, it now falls on Biden to “shine” during the debate if he hopes to gain any advantage. This double standard — where the most experienced candidate must work twice as hard to seem slightly more credible than the least qualified — is deeply troubling. Hopefully, Biden can hold his ground, but without support from the moderators or the press, it may be difficult to convince the public that he truly prevailed. If there’s one lesson from this election, it’s that journalistic integrity is fading fast, if not already gone.",1
"In 2008, President Barack Obama ran a tightly contested election against a charismatic but somewhat inexperienced Republican challenger, John McCain. For all his flaws, McCain was more respected and less controversial than today’s GOP candidate. Obama managed to secure his victory largely due to his strong appeal to younger voters and his message of hope and change. In fact, the 2008 campaign brought the term “youth vote” into the national spotlight, as a generation that had grown up in the shadow of the Iraq War began to take political action for the first time. These young voters, eager to see a new direction, felt it was their duty to protect the future by choosing someone who promised progress. Fast forward 12 years to the 2020 presidential election, and this same group of young voters is once again set to play a crucial role in shaping the outcome. The 2020 version of these politically engaged voters seems poised to support Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and the events of last week explain why. On Wednesday, a suspicious device was found near a public event in downtown Chicago, prompting a citywide alert. Later that day, another device was discovered in a nearby subway station. By Thursday, authorities had confirmed at least three more devices in different parts of the city, leading to widespread evacuations and heightened security. As the situation unfolded, left-leaning media and politicians were quick to criticize President Trump for his early remarks about the incidents, calling his statements “alarmist” and “unwarranted.” They argued that there was no proof of a connection to extremist groups or any specific ideology. Meanwhile, on Friday, law enforcement arrested a suspect with ties to far-right extremism, a man who had been under surveillance for months. By Saturday, the suspect had confessed to planting the devices, citing ideological motivations. As the nation grappled with the reality of domestic terrorism, some liberal leaders initially hesitated to label the attacks as such. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, refused to use the word “terrorism” publicly, insisting that without clear evidence of a motive, the term shouldn’t be applied. “We know it was intentional and violent,” he said, “but we don’t know the full story yet.” This reluctance to acknowledge the threat only fueled frustration among many Americans. Meanwhile, Joe Biden used the incident to attack Trump’s approach to national security, claiming that his rhetoric was emboldening extremists. “Words matter,” Biden",1
"Imagine that… at least 65% of the rioters in Raleigh, North Carolina were brought in by bus. They had out-of-state licenses. It seems like this was a coordinated effort. I heard from a friend in Oklahoma City that they were also busing people into their city under the guise of protest. In our area, things stayed calm, thank goodness. But Raleigh wasn’t so lucky. The local police chief openly stated that these were not ordinary protesters, but organized individuals with criminal backgrounds. This is how the far-left has been orchestrating these demonstrations from the start. They wait for a trigger event, then use marginalized communities as pawns in their scheme. Bring in outside agitators, stir up violence, and watch the chaos unfold. The real goal is to create division and unrest across the country. Raleigh was a win for them… Oklahoma City was not. From Louder with Crowder: Are you telling me most of the people causing trouble in North Carolina aren’t even from there? No way. Generally, when there’s a riot, it’s locals who are invested in the cause, not outsiders. No, I’m serious. Let’s hear it from CNN… “These aren’t protesters — they’re outsiders coming in to incite violence. They’re not from Raleigh. You look at the arrests, and over 65% have out-of-state IDs. These are not people who live here.” I think the reason it didn’t escalate in Oklahoma City is because the community isn’t as receptive to BLM. Plus, the officer involved in the shooting has already been charged with murder. I still believe she acted in self-defense, but the legal action probably helped keep tensions lower. Raleigh has a strong BLM presence, and with previous incidents there, it was a perfect setup for a riot. It’s no longer a conservative area, and that plays into their strategy. These groups don’t care about truth or justice — they just want conflict. Their endgame is to tear down the system and create widespread disorder. That’s what radical ideologies aim for — race riots and civil unrest, all in the name of revolution.",1
"The Drudge Report has uncovered the official guidelines for the upcoming presidential showdown between Biden and Trump. With Joe always looking for an edge, especially when it comes to media coverage, it seems he’s been given a special platform to help balance the height gap. However, when it comes to handling a sudden health issue, Biden will be on his own. Let’s hope he can keep the paramedics on standby in case “unfit to lead Biden” has another “respiratory-related incident” like the one during the Pennsylvania rally… DEBATE RULES: NO MEDICAL BREAKS **Exclusive** Thu Oct 5 2023 14:22:17 ET If President Joe Biden experiences a sudden coughing fit or any other medical emergency during Tuesday’s intense debate, he’ll have to push through, the DRUDGE REPORT has confirmed! “There are no timeouts,” a commission source said. “None at all.” Moderator Andrea Mitchell won’t be allowed to pause the debate for any reason, even if it means the candidates have to continue speaking through discomfort. Biden has had several respiratory issues throughout the campaign, including a 3-minute episode during a town hall meeting. The debate is expected to draw over 80 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched political events of the year. EDITOR’S NOTE: The debate commission addressed an early controversy when Biden requested a raised platform to help him appear taller next to 6’4” Trump. Campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon worried he’d look physically overwhelmed. The request was denied, but the commission agreed to a custom podium to offset their height difference.",1
"Local Charlotte, NC news outlet WSOCTV is reporting that eyewitnesses claim dash camera footage shows Keith Scott exiting his vehicle and approaching officers with a weapon in hand: #BREAKING: Eyewitnesses tell Channel 9 dash camera video shows #KeithScott exiting car, walking toward officers with gun in his hand pic.twitter.com/GGuM2Ow3wk — WSOCTV (@wsoctv) September 21, 2016  For a second consecutive night, protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a fatal police shooting turned chaotic, with officers using tear gas and demonstrators throwing objects at police vehicles. Keith Lamont Scott, a father of seven, was shot by law enforcement in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday while officers were attempting to serve a warrant for another individual. The incident sparked a tense evening of unrest, and the following night saw demonstrations continue, starting as a peaceful march through downtown before turning volatile. As protesters gathered near the Omni Hotel, some climbed onto the roof of a nearby mall and hurled items at the crowd. Others attempted to break into the hotel, prompting police in full riot gear to respond. Scott’s family maintained he was unarmed, sitting in his car reading a book while waiting for his son. However, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney stated that Scott exited his vehicle with a gun, not a book, and no evidence of a book was found at the scene. “It’s time for the voiceless majority to speak out,” said the chief, who is also African-American. “The facts show the story is different from what has been shared online.” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book?

"On Thursday, I reported that among those arrested in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 65% of the agitators and looters were from other states. However, a journalist is now raising questions about why these individuals aren't being charged with federal offenses for crossing state lines to incite violence. John Mercer writes at The Conservative Voice that the Department of Justice appears to have a “selective enforcement” approach, suggesting that “non-enforcement of the law has become routine over the past several years.” Mercer argues that the presence of out-of-state rioters should be a red flag for the DOJ, but instead, the department seems indifferent. He claims that the Justice Department has become so politicized that it no longer upholds the rule of law. He notes: “Criminals posing as demonstrators cross state lines to spread chaos and destruction. Has anyone noticed that the law against interstate rioting is being ignored by federal officials?” According to the U.S. Code, 18 U.S.C. § 2101 states that anyone who travels across state lines or uses interstate communication with the intent to incite, organize, or participate in a riot can face fines or imprisonment. This law was designed to prevent local conflicts from escalating into nationwide unrest when outsiders are involved. Yet, it's clearly not being enforced. Mercer points to incidents like the 2020 protests in Portland, where out-of-state groups were seen actively participating in violence, yet no federal action was taken. He adds, “Whoever incites, supports, or participates in rebellion against the United States or its laws deserves severe punishment. But instead, we see selective justice.” This isn’t the first time Mercer has criticized the DOJ’s handling of such cases. In 2017, he wrote about similar issues during the Baltimore riots, where out-of-state activists were present but not prosecuted. He concluded, “The administration shows favor, while the DOJ shows apathy.” This pattern of selective enforcement is troubling. It not only undermines public trust but also allows lawbreakers to go unpunished while innocent citizens are targeted. Perhaps it’s time for the public to demand accountability from their leaders and push for real reform. Reprinted with permission from The Conservative Voice.

"If an October surprise doesn’t stop Hillary, the disaffected can. The disaffected and their allies can bring her down. Opposition to Hillary could be a broad movement, not just limited to Trump supporters. Here is the list of the disaffected: 1. Coal workers. 2. Oil rig employees. 3. Coastal fishermen in Maine. 4. Individuals who lost jobs due to trade policies, healthcare reforms, and rising minimum wages. 5. People who feel unsafe without access to firearms for personal protection. 6. Young adults burdened by student debt but struggling to find stable work. 7. Families affected by crimes committed by undocumented immigrants or refugees. 8. Residents of Wisconsin and Ohio who suffered from polluted water due to government neglect. 9. Students impacted by declining academic standards under No Child Left Behind and Common Core. 10. Followers of various faiths who oppose the spread of Sharia law. 11. People who support family planning but are against abortion. 12.

"Hillary Clinton seized the opening presidential debate of the general election cycle to confront Donald Trump head-on, provoking him on issues like his financial history, tax practices, gender attitudes, racial comments, business ethics, and personal integrity. If Clinton was looking for a clash, she got one. Her sharp tone drew Trump into verbal sparring, and he responded with bursts of frustration that reflected both public discontent and his more aggressive public image. The exchange grew intense at times, with Trump’s tone taking on a sharper edge. “She doesn’t look the part,” Trump remarked near the end of the debate. “She lacks the strength.” At times, Trump seemed unsettled, especially as the debate progressed. However, his main criticisms of Clinton were policy-based, aiming to channel widespread dissatisfaction not just with her, but with the political establishment as a whole. “You’ve been in politics for 30 years — why are these solutions coming now?” Trump asked during a discussion on job creation. “I've thought about this a lot,” Clinton replied. “Yeah, for 30 years,” Trump shot back. Trump stretched the truth and questioned Clinton’s emotional stability, though he largely maintained his composure.  

Throughout the debate, Clinton addressed Trump by his first name, while he consistently called her “Secretary Clinton” and made it clear he was fine with that. “I want you to be very comfortable. It's really important to me,” Trump said, once again challenging fact-checkers. Trump faced his most vulnerable moment when moderator Lester Holt brought up the issue of President Obama’s birthplace — specifically why Trump waited until just weeks before to declare the matter resolved. Trump flatly stated, “I have nothing to say” about why he pushed the topic for so long. He also falsely claimed Clinton started the birther controversy in 2007, saying he had put the issue to rest. “Just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce Obama’s birth certificate,” Trump said. Clinton capitalized on an issue that resonated with Black voters and other members of the Obama coalition. “It can't be dismissed so easily. He built his political career on this racist lie that our first Black president wasn't a citizen,” she said. “The birther claim was deeply hurtful.” Concerned that Trump might behave more politely, Clinton launched her attacks early, suggesting that his success came from privilege and that he was hiding his tax returns to avoid scrutiny. “",1
"President Obama has always been a radical left-wing progressive with strong socialist leanings. There’s no denying it. Why else would he push policies like the Affordable Care Act, stricter gun regulations, and a significant increase in refugee admissions? It seems he hasn’t softened his stance at all. During his last appearance at the United Nations General Assembly, as a sitting president, he delivered a speech that left many Americans stunned. In his address, he made some extreme claims about American liberty, suggesting that the U.S. might need to surrender certain freedoms to achieve global cooperation. He argued that true international security can only be maintained through global institutions like the United Nations. Obama claimed that the only freedom worth keeping is the right to self-defense, but everything else, he implied, is open to negotiation. He even acknowledged that many Americans disagree with this view, yet he remained steadfast in his position. I hope he's enjoying his retirement on a tropical island, far from the public eye. What a joke! He knows his supporters don't back him on this, but his arrogance and refusal to compromise make it clear he sees himself as infallible. This attitude perfectly reflects the deep divisions in Washington today. If the nation's leader won’t reach across the aisle, why should anyone else? It's like a parent telling their children not to lie, then lying themselves and wondering why the kids don’t listen. Watch President Obama’s full speech here,",1
"No matter the cause, Leftists are for it—until it affects them personally. They support the police, until they decide to criticize them. They back the military, until it’s time to condemn it. Now another example has surfaced, as reported by the Washington Times. The same Chicago environmentalists who recently opposed filmmaker George Lucas’s museum project are now backing the nearby Obama Presidential Library, drawing accusations of political double standards. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, stated Friday that her group is “excited” about the Obama Center’s development in Jackson Park on Chicago’s South Side. Just weeks ago, the group successfully halted Lucas’s plans for a similar lakefront project seven miles north of the Obama site after a two-year legal fight. The environmentalists’ shift contradicts their own mission. The Obama Center would involve clearing trees and grass in Jackson Park, while the Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans. It seems like another case of environmental “selective concern”—destroying nature for a Black leader’s legacy, but protecting a parking lot for a white one. It’s not hard to see when liberals are just playing both sides.",1
"“I fully support President Obama’s efforts to strengthen gun regulations, but we need to begin immediately upon taking office and take down the gun lobby.” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC, 4/25/16. Many people see the 2016 election as a defining moment for the country, one that could shape its future in ways we’ve never seen before. They fear that the outcome could lead to a drastic shift in our national values and way of life. While I may not share all their concerns, I do believe that our fundamental freedoms are under threat. The progressive movement has taken on an authoritarian tone that’s unprecedented in American history, claiming it’s for our own protection.  

“The Supreme Court has misinterpreted the Second Amendment, and I will fight to correct that mistake at every opportunity,” – Hillary Clinton, The Free Beacon, 10/1/15. In this tense political environment, the NRA stands firm in its mission to protect the Second Amendment from what it sees as an aggressive left-wing agenda. The organization claims that if Hillary Clinton is elected, she will do everything possible to weaken or eliminate the right to bear arms. To expose what they see as her true intentions, the NRA has released a new advertisement as part of its “Don’t Let Hillary Leave You Vulnerable” campaign.

"In the aftermath of the explosions that rocked the Brooklyn neighborhood of New York, Atlantic City, and Newark, NJ, a message has surfaced from a former Navy SEAL, identified only as “K,” who claims to have witnessed the growing threat firsthand. Here’s his unfiltered account. Dear Trump, Pence, and conservatives wary of the “R” word, I’ve spent over two decades serving our nation in the U.S. Navy, and I love this country with all my heart, but that’s not what matters. What matters is what you did when given the responsibility to protect it. Instead of empowering citizens to defend themselves, you treated them like helpless victims, stripping away their rights under the guise of safety. You allowed dangerous individuals—those who openly reject American values and pledge loyalty to extremist groups—to enter the country without proper screening, while they plotted against us from within. That’s how you dismantle a nation without ever firing a shot, and you’ve done it with alarming ease. Repeat after me: You are not ready for this. Your entire platform is built on the belief that radical Islam is a distant problem, something that doesn’t affect us here. Well, guess what? It does. When you let in people who openly hate us and then tell the public that criticizing their beliefs is offensive, you create the perfect environment for violence. This is how we end up with attacks like the one in Orlando, and how we get bombings in New York, Newark, and Atlantic City—where sailors were participating in a community event, using the very same IEDs I’ve seen used to kill my fellow service members overseas. When President Obama said, “Don’t let fear dictate your actions,” this is what he meant. The threat is here, and you’ve basically handed them a welcome mat. If you’re too afraid to admit it, I will: These attacks were a clear act of terrorism. There’s no ambiguity. Every second you delay, the extremists gain more strength. These attacks were carried out by people who want to terrorize our way of life. They despise our freedom and seek to control us, just like you try to control our speech, our choices, and our politics. But America is stronger than that. We’re not weaklings needing protection from every shadow. We are the country of resilience, courage, and a people who don’t back down from danger. We have the most powerful military on earth, and a population that, unlike your left-wing allies",1
"President Obama and Black Lives Matter have been pushing for the past year the idea that only Black people are being unfairly targeted because of their race. However, a new video circulating online contradicts this claim. A Black Lives Matter supporter was caught on camera violently attacking an innocent, unarmed woman. The footage is disturbing. Last week, two white women were brutally attacked in Stockton, California, after leaving a Red Robin restaurant. CBS Local reported that a protest was taking place to honor Colby Friday, an African American man killed by police in August. The two women were walking near the protest when the attack happened. When questioned by police, they claimed they thought the assault was racially motivated. As the saying goes, if it looks like a duck and acts like a duck, it’s not a pig. Assistant District Attorney Ron Freitas stated that the attackers were from out of town and that their actions had no connection to the protest or Colby’s death, suggesting the attack was racially driven. A $10,000 reward has been offered for any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. This nation is becoming more dangerous with these individuals on the loose. Yet, predictably, mainstream liberal media has ignored the story, choosing not to cover it. Naturally, it doesn’t fit the narrative of Black oppression. It paints Black Lives Matter in a bad light. In fact, it makes them look racist—exactly what they accuse white people of being. It also exposes them as the biggest hypocrites around. But then again, hypocrisy is often associated with liberals.",1
"This election will force us to choose between two very different paths: a highly experienced, compassionate leader, or a controversial, populist businessman. The leader, Kamala Harris, has spent her career advocating for equality and justice, while the businessman, Elon Musk, has focused largely on his own ventures and interests. One group that typically supports progressive causes — but has shown some shifting toward more conservative views lately — is the Jewish community. In previous elections, like 2016 and 2020, a significant percentage of Jewish Americans voted for the Democratic candidate. This year, however, the choice feels more urgent. Instead of facing traditional Republican figures, the Democrats are now up against a figure seen by many as dangerously polarizing. Their message to younger generations is clear: vote for Kamala Harris. Why? Because they've seen it all before. A video titled ""A Message From Grandma & Grandpa: We've Seen This Before"" features elderly Jewish Americans urging their grandchildren to participate in the election and warn them about the type of leadership Elon Musk represents. They've enlisted grandparents as key voices in the campaign to stop Musk, saying, ""This is one of the most critical elections we’ve faced."" Their personal history with oppression and fear is central to their message: ""We have seen this before. We saw it in Europe, and we don’t want to see it again."" Their concern for Musk is not subtle, and for good reason: ""Musk isn’t just a disruptor. He’s an arrogant, self-centered individual, and I have no respect for him. I’m scared for the country and for you, my grandchildren."" With a mix of humor and seriousness, one grandparent jokes, ""If you don’t vote for Kamala, and Musk wins, I’ll haunt you when I’m gone."" Another promises to cause trouble: ""I’ll ruin every movie night by making offensive comments, but if you’re voting for Musk, maybe you don’t mind."" The video, produced by a Jewish advocacy group, aims to remind future generations of the dangers of extremism and the importance of listening to those who know the cost of hatred.

"One doesn't need to wear the flag on their sleeve to be a citizen of this nation. But when I hear criticisms of American values disguised as ""progressive"" ideology, I can't help but ask, ""If you despise what this country represents, why do you choose to live here?"" That’s the question that should be directed at those who have pressured a university to alter a cultural celebration due to its ""offensive"" patriotic elements.  

Students at SUNY Fredonia in New York were organizing a themed fall festival for campus members, with a focus on “American traditions.” As they began planning, they were told by campus staff that the event needed to be rebranded because the patriotic theme was “too provocative.” The official responsible for the decision, Residence Life Coordinator Michael Torres, stated that the use of the phrase “Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death” on promotional materials was considered “too militaristic and divisive.” Was a history lesson somehow equated with a recruitment pitch? Torres claimed the directive came from higher-ups, but when pressed, he said, “I’m not entirely sure who made the call. I just followed what I was told.” Other events had used similar phrases without issue, which left many confused.  

The festival proceeded with a more neutral theme, drawing around 250 attendees. University administrators avoided direct answers and called the situation a “misunderstanding.” Still, student organizers are determined to uncover the real reason behind the change. What’s most concerning isn’t just the growing anti-patriotic sentiment in some academic circles, but the blind obedience to bureaucratic rules that allow such decisions to go unchallenged. When authority figures say, “Because we said so,” it sets a dangerous precedent.",1
"According to Dallas Police, around 65% of the demonstrators in the area are not locals, but instead ""outside agitators."" “This isn’t a peaceful protest,” said a representative from the Dallas Police Association. “These are outsiders coming in with a clear agenda. They’re not here for justice — they’re here to create chaos.” The spokesperson noted that many of the arrested individuals had out-of-state identification, and that several were seen arriving on charter buses from neighboring states. “If you check the arrest records from last night, you’ll see most of them aren’t from Dallas at all,” he added. In fact, police believe these groups were brought in specifically to incite violence in the city. A similar pattern was observed during the protests in Baltimore. #Dallas police: 65% of arrested protesters had out-of-state IDs, outside groups are behind the unrest https://t.co/8zDgqWJp9m — TexanWatch (@TexanWatch) August 15, 2017

However, police later found a small, loaded gun near the scene. Here is a video taken by the victim's partner during the confrontation. Warning: Graphic Content

"“He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America. . “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” Watch below:  Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “Thank you, law enforcement. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two. We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.  We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. As BizPacReview reported: “We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him.",1
"Terrorism seems to be causing more confusion than fear, I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb explodes in the U.S. or when the phrase Allahu Akbar is shouted during a mass shooting. I heard the Los Angeles Mayor claim the recent explosion had nothing to do with the one in Chicago on the same day. It's clear the FBI could take a lesson from this official. A Fox News anchor suggested the blast might have been a pressure cooker accidentally thrown into a trash bin. The media will bring in so-called experts to offer endless opinions on something that doesn’t need any explanation—just one simple truth. These people are going to kill us unless we act first. When law enforcement captures or kills one, I don’t care about their background, which the media always uses to create a dramatic story. All I want is for them to be punished swiftly, without the luxury of a prison cell that offers a Muslim diet, free healthcare, recreational facilities, a TV to watch global terrorist activities, and a Quran with a prayer mat. Terrorists should be tried within thirty days of capture and sentenced in the same timeframe. I'm just a regular person, and I’d rather form my own thoughts instead of letting the media decide for me. After all, who wants to be misled?",1
"Well, let's hear it straight. When a Muslim criticizes the U.S., you might not expect them to be an American citizen. That’s exactly what happened with American gymnast Aly Raisman, who recently became the first female Olympic athlete to compete in a hijab. Surprisingly, she has some harsh words about the country she represents. According to a recent interview with The Daily Beast: [I feel targeted] constantly. I’ve been followed in public and accused of being a spy just because of how I look. This happened near Times Square last week… I know these incidents are tough, but they’re nothing compared to the violence in places like Chicago or the hate directed at the Kaepernick family during the presidential debates. It’s time we address this issue. But let’s not act like America is full of Islamophobes when hate crimes against Christians are far more common. If she’s so unhappy, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim nation? The answer is obvious—nowhere else do Muslims enjoy the same freedoms as they do here. She won’t be arrested for praying in public. She won’t face forced marriage. She won’t be banned from driving. She won’t be punished for speaking out. In many Muslim-majority countries, these things happen daily. So maybe she can handle a little bias in return for her rights.",1
"What's behind the News Media's silence on the recent violent attacks happening right under our noses? I only found out about the latest shootings and arson incidents through a viral post online. You'd expect these events to be front-page news across all major networks, wouldn't you? Maybe it's because of a specific video that's been circulating. I'm certain Hillary Clinton wants you to think Donald Trump is directly responsible for this new wave of extremism in America. She’s practically hinted at it. These attacks couldn’t possibly be linked to Obama’s immigration failures—oh no, the very policies Hillary plans to push forward without hesitation. It's possible the media is downplaying these incidents to avoid casting any shadow on Crooked Hillary. Would CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, or even Fox ever be used as a tool to support her agenda? What kind of person would question the integrity of today's American media? Where has our country gone? The news we're fed now feels like propaganda, similar to what people in the old Soviet Union were forced to watch—stories twisted with just enough truth to trick the masses. Flat-out lies. Anyone with common sense can see through this deception.",1
"Republican candidate Donald Trump has been walking a dangerous line for quite some time, drawing sharp criticism across the country for a foreign policy that openly aligns with the interests of Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian leader of Russia. He’s surrounded himself with advisors who have deep connections to the Kremlin and the powerful elites who control Russia’s economic landscape. Trump has also received open backing from Russian state media and intelligence agencies, which have previously hacked into Democratic Party systems and released sensitive information in an effort to create division. Despite this, Trump has repeatedly denied any financial ties to Russia, claiming in a July tweet, “I have ZERO investments in Russia.” But now — prepare yourself for a revelation — it seems he's been hiding the truth. A recent investigation by *CBS News* has uncovered that Donald Trump has ""extensive connections"" to Russian interests both domestically and abroad. “The amount of money involved is in the hundreds of millions — what he gained through interactions with Russian businessmen. They were eager to invest with him and work with Donald Trump, and they were eager to be associated with him,” explains Elena Grigorieva, a prominent U.S.-Russia business analyst. Trump has benefited greatly from his ventures with Russian billionaires, including hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and selling high-end real estate to a large number of Russian clients — so many that parts of Florida, like Sunny Isles and Hollywood, became known as “Little Moscow.” These Russian tycoons built their fortunes during the post-Soviet transition by acquiring massive stakes in state-owned enterprises, becoming ultra-wealthy almost overnight. During the Yeltsin era, they controlled between 50% and 75% of the country’s financial assets. Today, they use their wealth and influence to support the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye to their exploitation of the nation. Putin is believed to have a personal fortune of at least $70 billion, possibly much more. The oligarchs constantly seek ways to move their illicit wealth out of Russia, and purchasing Trump properties has become a popular method. It’s no surprise — they’re all part of the same elite circle, driven by self-interest and materialism. “For them, wealth is more than just money; it’s a symbol of power and status. They spend extravagantly on luxury items…They don’t value culture or education. Their idea of impressing people is buying a private jet,” says former KGB officer Igor Smir",1
"(FOX News) Former President George H.W. Bush revealed Tuesday that he plans to support Hillary Clinton in the upcoming November election, according to several individuals familiar with the 41st President's remarks — a rare and unexpected shift from his party's standard line. The statement was reportedly made during a brief exchange at a gathering hosted by the nonpartisan Points of Light Foundation, where Bush was speaking with Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and former Maryland lieutenant governor. The event included about 35 attendees, and multiple sources confirmed hearing the comment. 

This development marks a significant turn in the long-standing political dynamic between the Bush and Clinton families, who have had a complex history since Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush in 1992. The timing of the announcement — just 48 days before the election and just days before the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump — has sparked considerable attention.

Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller stated on Fox News that the president’s decision is “respectful,” adding, “It’s ironic that he would support the wife of the man who beat him in 1992.” Miller also noted that the primary race was “tough” and that “feelings run deep.”

The news initially spread through social media when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with Bush, captioning it: “President Bush said he’s voting for Hillary!” She later removed the post, but not before it gained traction online. A Bush family representative declined to confirm or deny the claim, stating, “The president will cast his vote as a private citizen, and he is not commenting on the race in the interim.”

Sources close to the conversation expressed surprise that the discussion was shared publicly, though Kennedy Townsend has not yet responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, other members of the Bush family have taken different stances. George H.W. Bush’s son, Marvin, has indicated he will support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, while his grandson, George P. Bush, has backed Trump. Jeb Bush, who ran against Trump in the primaries, has said he will not vote for either major candidate.

Despite the family divisions, several former Bush administration officials have expressed support for Clinton, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. Meanwhile, George W. Bush has remained silent on the matter, focusing instead on efforts to retain Republican control of the Senate.

"Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his quirky, improvisational talk show, *Between Two Ferns*. Known for his unconventional style, Galifianakis has previously sat down with President Obama, Brad Pitt, and even Justin Bieber. However, there's one high-profile figure he has consistently refused to invite onto the show. When asked by the *Los Angeles Times* if he’d consider bringing Republican nominee Donald Trump on after his successful interview with Clinton, Galifianakis gave a surprisingly funny and revealing response. “No way. It doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way around? Not my thing. He’s the type of person who craves attention—any kind of attention. You’re talking about someone with some serious issues. I wouldn’t want to take advantage of someone like that. And you can print that.” *Between Two Ferns* is famous for its awkward humor and bold questions (like when Galifianakis asked Obama, “How does it feel to be the last black president?”). The show thrives on the tension between the host and guest as they try not to react. Considering how Trump often explodes at the slightest criticism and can’t resist responding to even the smallest provocation, it’s clear Galifianakis made the right call. Yet, it’s alarming that a man who couldn’t handle a bit of comedic scrutiny could actually be considered for the presidency; his emotional instability raises serious concerns about his ability to lead.",1
"Tonight's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shaping up to be a major event, with many high-profile figures tuning in from both the comfort of their homes and the front row. Billionaire investor and ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban has confirmed he'll be sitting in the front row at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, to support Hillary Clinton. ""Just got a front-row seat to watch @HillaryClinton dominate @realDonaldTrump at the 'Humbling at Hofstra' on Monday. It’s happening!"" Cuban shared on social media.  

""I'm not a Trump supporter,"" Cuban told ABC News during the ""Shark Tank"" premiere. ""I think Hillary would be an excellent president. I just don’t believe Trump has the qualifications."" He added, ""If he were on 'Shark Tank,' I wouldn’t invest in him. He doesn’t seem capable at all.""  

Trump quickly fired back, tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers, the performer who had a well-known relationship with Bill Clinton before he became president. ""If dumb Mark Cuban wants to sit in the front row, maybe I’ll have Gennifer Flowers right next to him!""  

Although Trump's team denied the invitation, it was reported that Flowers was open to attending. ""Hi Donald. You know I’m in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!...??"" she replied.  

Meanwhile, other celebrities are preparing to watch the first showdown between the two candidates. Here's what they're saying online:  

""Ready for #mudslingmonday #YOUGOTTHISHRC""  

""May angels protect everyone at the debate tonight. Sending love, strength, and hope.""  

""My goal is to avoid tweeting during the debate. As the kids say, #lifegoals.""  

""I think something huge is going to happen tomorrow. Just feel it.""  

""1. Will you be watching the debate tomorrow? 2. Will you be open-minded or already decided? 3. What snack will you have?""  

""Why schedule a debate on a Monday night when football is on? Makes sense to someone, I guess.""  

""For the debates, I'm thinking of serving kebabs. With Cheetos and Skittles, of course.""

"The Drudge Report has obtained the official guidelines for the upcoming presidential showdown between Biden and Trump. With Biden constantly seeking an edge, especially when it comes to media coverage, it seems he’s already working to secure a few advantages. According to sources, Biden will be given a raised platform to help counter Trump’s height, but when it comes to handling a sudden health issue, he’ll be on his own. Let’s hope for Biden’s sake that the man with the oxygen tank stays close by in case “unfit to lead” Biden suffers another “respiratory episode” like the one during the Iowa debate… DEBATE RULES: NO MEDICAL BREAKS **Exclusive** Thu Oct 12 2023 14:15:30 ET If President Joe Biden experiences a sudden breathing difficulty or any other medical emergency during Tuesday’s critical debate, he’ll have to push through, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned! “There are no time-outs,” a commission insider confirmed. “No exceptions.” Moderator Lester Holt won’t be able to pause the broadcast or cut to commercial during the tense 90-minute clash. Also, neither candidate’s microphone will be adjusted for volume or clarity. Biden has had several breathing issues throughout the campaign, including a notable incident at a town hall where he struggled for over five minutes. Tuesday’s debate is expected to draw over 80 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched political events in recent history. EDITOR’S NOTE: The presidential debate committee addressed an early controversy when Biden requested a step-stool to stand taller against the 6’5” Trump. Campaign manager Jennifer O'Malley-DiAlessio raised concerns that Biden would appear physically disadvantaged. The request was denied, but the committee agreed to a custom podium to help balance the height difference.",1
"As this chaotic election season reaches its final stretch, the topic of racial tensions in America has taken center stage. With recent incidents of two black men being shot by police in St. Louis and Baltimore, the situation is growing increasingly volatile. While progressives argue that these events highlight deep-seated systemic racism, conservatives counter with historical figures like Frederick Douglass and Rosa Parks to claim the opposite. Liberals see these shootings as evidence of a broken system that disproportionately targets Black individuals, while some on the right frame them as just consequences for ""criminal behavior."" A common tactic among modern conservatives is to ignore due process and instead focus on the past records of those involved, often painting entire communities with the same brush. They overlook how institutional bias affects policing and sentencing, yet seem to know every minor infraction committed by every Black person killed by law enforcement. While scrolling through a Twitter thread covering a report about a St. Louis officer being charged in the death of a man with his hands up, I stumbled upon a tweet that clearly demonstrates how deeply ingrained racism remains in American society: @foxnews@blp3pic.twitter.com/4rKd8L9Z6A — Theresa (@VOTE_TRUMP_) October 5, 2016  
Once again, conservatives are trying to justify the officer’s actions by highlighting the victim’s past misconduct. The issue? The tweet references a different case altogether—this one involving a man from Chicago, not the one in St. Louis. My reply was straightforward: @VOTE_TRUMP_ @foxnews @blp3 Why does the victim’s history matter? Oh…because “they” are all the same, right? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer (@wilekenmeyer) October 5, 2016  
It's not surprising that someone would conflate the records of two completely different men from different cities. What's more troubling is that no one corrected the error. My point was clear. To the conservative racist, it doesn’t matter if the crimes were committed by different people or if they had nothing in common. “They” are all the same. It's ironic that her handle is “@VOTE_TRUMP_,” isn’t it?",1
"Hillary Clinton has suddenly canceled a major fundraising event, leaving donors and reporters scratching their heads! The planned ""lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton"" was set to take place at the home of Richard and Susan Baker and featured donation tiers ranging from $2,700 to $100,000. No official explanation was provided for the abrupt cancellation, which comes as her campaign continues to face mounting pressure. Some are questioning whether her ongoing health concerns are behind the move, especially as the campaign recently spent over $45 million in an effort to counter Donald Trump's momentum.  

According to WNCN, while Clinton's event in Durham was called off, Trump is set to hold a rally in Goldsboro on Tuesday, just days after a stop in New Bern. The event will be held at the Wayne County Fairgrounds, expected to draw thousands of supporters. Local schools have already announced early dismissals in anticipation of heavy traffic.  

The Clinton fundraiser, originally promoted as an exclusive opportunity to meet the former Secretary of State, had four tiers: $100,000 for a “private reception,” $33,000 for a “hosting experience,” $5,000 for “preferred seating,” and $2,700 for general attendance. Though Clinton won’t be present, Trump is making headlines with his upcoming appearances.

"President Barack Obama delivered what was meant to be his last speech to the U.N. General Assembly, and it sparked controversy with its pessimistic take on the limits of military force in combating Islamist extremism across the Middle East. The speech suggested that even the strongest military power in the world, the United States, may not be able to achieve lasting success in these conflicts. According to a report from Breitbart, Obama questioned the effectiveness of military solutions, particularly in regions like Syria, where he claimed there is ""no ultimate military victory to be won."" He emphasized the need for diplomacy and cooperation, stating, “We must be honest about the nature of these conflicts and continue working with those who want to build peace rather than fuel destruction.” While acknowledging that military action may play a role, Obama stressed the importance of addressing the root causes of violence and fostering mutual respect among different communities. His remarks have raised concerns among critics who argue that such an approach fails to recognize the clear connection between radical Islam and violence. Some question how effective this strategy will be under leaders who often downplay the threat of extremist groups and prioritize political correctness over national security. As the election season approaches, many are left wondering whether this kind of rhetoric will lead to real change or further weaken America’s global standing.

"Donald Trump is, well, dangerous. He has repeatedly called for constructing a massive wall along the southern border to keep out waves of illegal immigrants—specifically, he’s labeled them as ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" from Mexico and other countries. He has also supported the idea of registering all Muslims in the U.S., similar to how Hitler targeted Jews during World War II, and even suggested they be required to wear special ID tags. Furthermore, he has floated the idea of detaining Muslims in detention centers as a “temporary” measure. Trump has also made chilling remarks about targeting the families of terrorists, saying, “You have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself.” But that’s not enough for him—he wants to apply this mindset at home. In response to recent attacks in New York and New Jersey, his campaign claimed that Trump isn’t just fighting terrorism; he’s fighting the “narrative” of Obama and Clinton. According to the Trump team, his approach is simple: “Kill them all.” The attacks, which occurred on President Obama’s watch, are being used as justification for a broader crackdown. The campaign claims that 858 high-risk immigrants from dangerous regions have been granted citizenship under Obama and Clinton’s policies, putting Americans in danger. Clinton, they argue, is responsible for supporting a 550% surge in Syrian refugees and pushing for an open-border policy that threatens national security. Under Obama and Clinton, ISIS has grown stronger and more widespread, and the administration is seen as weak and ineffective. Trump, on the other hand, is said to understand the real threat: radical Islamic terrorism. He has repeatedly blamed Muslims for terrorist acts, often without evidence. How selective will he be when deciding who is a “terrorist”? As Trump said in March, “They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage… they have to open up to society and report the bad ones.” If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, does that make them suspects in Trump’s mind? How long before anyone practicing Islam is targeted? Would mass arrests follow? Trump has already suggested killing terrorists’ families. What defines terrorism under his rule? These questions remain unanswered. But what is clear is that Trump has shown a tendency to support extreme measures, including suggesting that opponents should be disarmed to “see what happens.” He’s also been linked to a reckless attitude toward nuclear weapons. It’s",1
"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is reportedly trying to squeeze as much public funding as possible from the government ahead of the election, with his campaign now accused of bilking the U.S. Secret Service out of $1.6 million for his protection. According to FEC reports, Trump’s team has been using a loophole in the agency's reimbursement policy by having Secret Service agents travel on private jets operated by Trump-owned TAG Air, Inc. While the standard practice is for campaigns to cover the cost of agent travel and then be reimbursed, Trump’s team is allegedly pocketing the difference by charging the government for flights that are ultimately paid for by taxpayers. In contrast, Hillary Clinton’s campaign has used Executive Fliteways for travel, a company with no ties to her or her team, ensuring no conflict of interest. Critics argue that if Clinton were using a similar arrangement, it would spark immediate outrage, but Trump’s supporters have shown little concern over his financial dealings. A Trump spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, stated that the campaign followed all FEC rules and urged questions to be directed to the Secret Service. Additionally, there are claims that the Secret Service may be covering hotel costs when agents stay at Trump’s properties, where he reportedly prefers budget-friendly accommodations, including cheap Chinese-made beds.",1
"In an exclusive interview with a Cleveland, Ohio television outlet, Donald Trump unintentionally revealed that his earlier 20-second statement affirming Barack Obama’s U.S. birthplace was merely a strategic move. Speaking to WOIO, Trump appeared to rekindle the birther controversy in a subtle, backhanded way. When asked by reporter Sarah Mitchell, “You previously stated that you now believe President Obama was born in the United States, after years of questioning it—what changed your mind?” Trump responded that he simply wanted to avoid further discussion on the topic. “I just wanted to focus on the campaign,” he said. “There were a lot of questions coming at me. People want to talk about jobs, the economy, the military, and stopping terrorism. We need to move past these issues and talk about what really matters.”  

Indeed, this slip suggested that Trump’s stance on Obama’s birthplace had never truly shifted, despite his public reassurances. For years, he had relentlessly pushed for Obama’s birth certificate, college records, and other documents, all in an effort to cast doubt on the President’s legitimacy. Now, it seems, he’s just tired of the scrutiny. Meanwhile, much of the media’s attention has been diverted to Trump’s ongoing legal troubles, including allegations of misuse of the Trump Foundation for personal expenses, harsh rhetoric targeting minority communities, and controversial comments following recent terror incidents in the Northeast.

"Republican candidate Donald Trump was thoroughly outmaneuvered by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the debate tonight, struggling to keep up with her calm, well-reasoned arguments. Whether discussing healthcare, foreign policy, or his own financial history, Trump appeared flustered and unprepared, unable to counter her clear and consistent positions. From the start, he was on the defensive, repeatedly failing to address the consequences of his own inconsistent policies and questionable business dealings. Shortly after the debate, Trump released a weak and self-pitying statement blaming the ""system"" for his poor performance, refusing to acknowledge that his own actions have alienated much of the public. This stubborn refusal to take responsibility not only reflects poorly on his character but also undermines the integrity of the democratic process. His microphone was clearly working, as he continually interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton, trying to deflect attention with cheap jabs. His behavior tonight reveals a lack of maturity and emotional control, making him unsuitable for the presidency. This latest display is just another example of his inability to lead with dignity.",1
"For over a decade, millennials have been labeled as the ""everyone gets a trophy"" generation, where effort and discipline are increasingly undervalued. In fact, the threshold for being considered a victim has never been lower. Surprisingly, the suspect in last weekend’s bombings in New Jersey and New York once claimed to be a victim of ""anti-Muslim bias."" According to reports, the alleged perpetrator, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and his father had previously filed a lawsuit against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey, accusing them of religious discrimination. They also alleged that members of the local community targeted them because of their faith. The Daily Mail investigated the case and uncovered some shocking details (as reported by Louder With Crowder): The main suspect in the recent attacks sued the Elizabeth police department, claiming they were unfairly targeting him because of his Muslim identity. In the lawsuit, Rahami stated that officers in the city subjected his family to discrimination and ""selective enforcement"" based on their religion. The family alleged that the police frequently issued baseless citations to their chicken restaurant, First American, forcing it to close earlier than usual. Ahmad, 28, along with his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, filed the lawsuit together, claiming that locals racially harassed them and told them, “Muslims don’t belong here.” The legal action was filed in 2011 and revealed that Rahami had long-standing issues with local authorities and neighbors. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi movie — it's real. Mayor Christian Bollwage denied any discrimination, telling the New York Times, “It was about complaints from residents, not about his ethnicity or religion. It was noise and people gathering in public spaces.” Rahami’s family runs a fried chicken restaurant called First American Fried Chicken in Elizabeth, NJ — the same town where several bombs were discovered at a train station earlier this week. The lawsuit was dismissed, so it seems his next move was to take matters into his own hands. Welcome to the era of political correctness, where even a terrorist can play the victim.

"and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by Plato’s Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. There are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to Congress.  With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting. With so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government?  As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval. Faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to “Roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good. . Not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. The irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ). What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house? This issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent.  It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof.  When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  As Ronald Reagan said, “ Trust but verify”.  There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat.  The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena. Fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  They think they can get away with it.  And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  In today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country. Now that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t.  If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him.",1
"Republicans have been breaking ranks to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this year’s general election, with a level of cross-party backing unseen in recent decades. According to a new report, the most notable shift comes from former President George H.W. Bush, who reportedly told a member of the Kennedy family that it was time to publicly endorse Clinton. At 92, Bush had planned to remain neutral in the presidential race, reflecting his discomfort with the GOP's direction under Donald Trump. However, his preference for the wife of his predecessor, Bill Clinton, eventually became public through Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and former Maryland lieutenant governor. The Bush family has long distanced itself from the rising tide of racial rhetoric within the Republican Party, especially after Jeb Bush married a woman of Hispanic descent and learned Spanish. It’s unsurprising that the eldest Bush would openly back Hillary Clinton early on. Both major conservative newspapers in Texas—Houston’s and Dallas’ leading dailies—had already endorsed Clinton before this year’s debates, which are set to begin next week. For the elder statesman, it must be comforting to know that Clinton’s grasp of national security is unmatched and her diplomatic connections with world leaders are unparalleled. While George H.W. Bush won’t be the only high-profile Republican to support Clinton, his decision carries weight due to his longstanding credibility.",1
"Matt Lauer is facing intense backlash from left-leaning media for his straightforward presidential debate with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. They’re demanding his resignation for questioning Clinton about her email scandal. Conservatives were surprised because liberals typically shield Clinton from scrutiny, but they became enraged when Lauer didn’t dig as deep as expected and also criticized Trump—though not as harshly as radical leftists would have. This has caused a firestorm among leftwing media figures. In the upcoming debate, they’re pushing moderators to ""fact-check"" Trump but not Clinton. The role of journalism is to present facts so people can form their own opinions. However, left-wing media today often pushes its own agenda rather than reporting objectively. Remember the 2012 Romney-Obama debate? The moderator aggressively defended Obama’s false claim that the attack on Ambassador Stevens was a terror act, even after admitting it was a lie the next day. I’m not a journalist—I have a degree in the field, but that doesn’t make me one. I don’t report news; I express my views. Before reading my work, I expect you to already understand the basics of what happened. If you rely solely on left-wing media, you may think my opinions are wrong because you believe my facts are lies. Some leftists criticize bloggers for expressing opinions, as if that makes our statements untrue. Sharing an opinion doesn’t make the facts false—unless you’re one of those who can’t tell truth from fiction. I’ve also been told I don’t argue well because I don’t always follow political correctness. I come from a school of thought that says “Stupid is as stupid does,” and “You can’t fix stupid.” Smart readers will learn from what I write, while the ignorant will do their own research. Ignorance can be fixed with education, but stupidity cannot. That’s why we ended up with Obama—because many believed his words without checking the facts. In the 1980s, I stopped watching TV news when I realized it was all anti-Reagan bias. Reagan removed the Fairness Doctrine, which had been used by Democrats under Truman to control media content. Once that restriction was lifted, right-wing media emerged, led by Rush Limbaugh and FOX News. Rush gave a voice to the Silent Majority who had been silenced for years. With a network that reported the news and allowed both sides to speak, the Moral Majority could finally engage in open debate with liberals. That’s why",1
"A Navy family in Texas said farewell to their cherished K-9 companion with a heartfelt ceremony. Max was a Navy K-9 who served two deployments in Iraq and took part in over 180 operations and 25 combat engagements. He spent almost 13 years by the side of his handler, Navy Chief Petty Officer Mark Thompson. “He never left my side, no matter the situation. He was my partner, my friend, and my protector,” Thompson shared with KHOU. After being separated for nearly a year due to a reassignment, Thompson and Max were reunited in early July at his sister’s house. The dog had been suffering from old age, and the family decided it was time to let him go. “I kept thinking about how devoted he was to our family, to me, and to the mission,” said Thompson’s father, James. “He just looked at me, and I knew it was time. We held each other for a long time.” Thompson expressed his gratitude to Max for all he had done. “I told him I loved him and that I would never forget him,” he added. The dog received a respectful military funeral, with Thompson lowering the American flag to half-mast and friends gathering to honor him at a memorial set up by the family. Thompson and his father—both in full uniform—carried their beloved dog in a flag-covered casket. While the loss is painful, Thompson believes their bond will last beyond this life. “I can picture one day, standing with my parents, my siblings, and Max, finally together again,” he said.",1
"Footage of the blast that occurred in Manhattan on Friday evening is spreading quickly across social media platforms. A sudden explosion late Friday night in what is commonly referred to as New York’s “Greenwich Village” area resulted in more than 25 individuals being hurt. Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed that the incident was clearly deliberate, though officials have not yet linked it to any known terrorist group. During a press briefing early Saturday morning, de Blasio emphasized that while there is no specific threat from any terror organization, the city is now on high alert. “There is no credible and specific threat against New York City at this moment. We believe this was an intentional act. I want to remind all New Yorkers that we will not be intimidated, and we will not let fear change who we are.”  

In addition to the initial blast, authorities conducted a search of the area on Saturday and discovered another suspicious device nearby. A makeshift bag containing a pressure cooker was found just two blocks from the original explosion site. The NYPD confirmed via a tweet around 1:45am that the device had been safely neutralized. “A suspicious item on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village has been safely removed by the NYPD Bomb Squad.”  

Police Commissioner James O’Neill stated that the explosion was not caused by a gas leak, but they still have no clear explanation for what triggered it. The scene is currently being treated as a crime site to ensure public safety. “The investigation is ongoing, and a thorough search is being carried out. The area surrounding the blast is under close scrutiny.” Watch the video below to see the moment of the explosion and the chaos that followed. It’s absolutely terrifying! Please keep the victims and their families in your thoughts… this violence must end.",1
"Animals act more civilized than this. Following the fatal shooting of a Black man by a Black police officer, tensions exploded in Charlotte, North Carolina. The situation was chaotic last night, but the two nights prior were extremely violent. A protester was killed when another protester fired into the crowd and struck him in the head. Dozens of officers were injured, along with many demonstrators. Protesters hurled bricks, bottles, rocks, and even garden tools at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper spray, and stun grenades. It felt like a battlefield. The unrest began after the suspect’s family spread a misleading account claiming the man was unarmed and reading a book while waiting for his son to return from school. No book was found, but a gun was. The man exited his vehicle with a gun drawn from a holster on his thigh. He got back in, then exited again with the weapon. An officer shot him after he refused to drop the gun. His family fueled the violence, as did a Muslim activist who supported them. They should be held accountable.  

From The Federalist Papers Project: Robert Gehl reported that during the second night of riots in Charlotte, rioters attempted to throw a journalist into a fire they had lit in the middle of the street. Local station WCCB shared a tweet Wednesday night stating that its reporters saw “protesters” trying to burn the photographer alive. This was echoed by Marvin Beach, a reporter for WCCB during their live stream. Beach claimed the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. As The Daily Caller noted, it's unclear why the attempt failed or what motivated it, but the live stream later showed police helping the unnamed photographer, who appeared unharmed. The photographer was white, which has led to speculation that he was targeted because of his race—there have been numerous instances of racially motivated violence during the two days of unrest. The most shocking incident involved a white photographer being seized by Black Lives Matter activists who tried to throw him into a fire and burn him. He survived, but could have easily died. A report from a WCCB journalist named Marvin Beach during the live stream described the event. It remains unclear why the attack didn’t succeed, but the footage later showed police rescuing the photographer without serious injury. What kind of people would do such a thing based solely on race? They're acting exactly like the system they claim to oppose. This won’t end well if it continues. This is what",1
"A message from our local artist and writer, Lila Monroe: Tragically, a terrible incident unfolded in our town last night when a lone gunman, who is still at large, opened fire at the Green Valley Plaza in Spokane, Washington, killing 4 people. This mall is one of my favorite places to visit with my family, and I often take my children there for weekend outings. My cousin was shopping there when the shooting began, and several other family members were working in different stores across the mall.

"Hillary and the loyal media are working overtime to slow Trump's momentum in the polls and maintain Hillary's relevance. There are signs that some African Americans are beginning to support Trump. A five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward Trump could be game-changing. When Democrats face challenges, they often bring up race as a distraction. Accusing President Obama of not being born in the U.S. is a classic ""race card"" tactic. Trump first raised this issue in 2011, which forced Hawaiian officials to release a copy of his birth certificate, though it wasn’t the original. It’s clear from history that Trump didn’t start the birther controversy — it was already circulating before he became involved. According to what we know, and what the media isn’t covering, the idea originated within the Clinton campaign. Did Hillary herself push it? Unlikely. It was likely promoted by her allies to keep her out of direct blame. “Who, me?” She had her “go-betweens,” much like organized crime families do. Here’s a scene reminiscent of *The Godfather II* during a Senate hearing:  

Here’s what we’ve uncovered: “[Ben Smith and Byron Tau] detailed in a four-page investigation how, in April 2008, as Clinton struggled against Obama for the Democratic nomination, ‘Clinton supporters’ circulated an anonymous email chain claiming that ‘Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She wasn’t allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother took him to Hawaii to register his birth.’” “These emails weren’t isolated. As Joshua Green reported in *The Atlantic* in August 2008, a March 19, 2007 strategy memo from Clinton adviser Mark Penn showed the campaign intentionally targeting Obama’s ‘lack of American roots.’” (Breitbart) For more details, check out “Hillary Clinton and the True History of Obama ‘Birtherism.’” I recommend reading the full Breitbart article to understand how Hillary’s 2008 campaign was deeply involved in suggesting Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and lacked true American heritage.  

But the birther issue goes back further — all the way to 1991. Joseph Farah of WND asks, “Who Was the First ‘Birther’?” “Trump wasn’t the first. Neither was",1
"Harassment is referred to in Arabic as ‘taharrush’. Public sexual assaults on women have been reported in Egypt since 2005, and recently this practice has been nicknamed the “game of taharrush.” Muslim men commit sexual violence against women in public settings, often using the cover of crowded events. They believe it is their right due to deeply rooted misogynistic beliefs that women should not be out alone and deserve to be humiliated through sexual abuse. Perpetrators often form multiple circles around a victim to prevent others from intervening. This disturbing behavior can involve groping, stripping, beating, biting, finger penetration, and rape. These incidents have increased significantly since 2012, when large protests in Egypt led to attacks on women who participated in demonstrations.  

It’s logical to assume that an influx of Muslim men who view this behavior as acceptable could bring similar crimes to Western nations. One such case involved an illegal Moroccan immigrant in Austria who attacked a woman, leaving her unconscious during an attempted rape. He was arrested and told the court that he came to “f*ck the women.” With prior convictions across Europe, his actions align with a pattern of sexual violence common among some young Muslim men. After the attack, the woman was found lying in bushes near a bus stop, suffering severe injuries and long-term psychological trauma. A student who discovered her described the scene: “She came up to me covered in blood. I couldn’t even see her face. She said, ‘I was raped.’” As migration continues to rise, these types of sexual assaults in Austria and Europe are expected to become more frequent.",1
"Footage of the blast that occurred in Los Angeles on Friday night is now circulating rapidly across major social media platforms. A violent explosion early Friday evening in the city's ""Silver Lake neighborhood"" resulted in more than 20 injuries. Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed that the blast was deliberate, but authorities have not yet identified any specific terrorist group behind it. During a press briefing late Friday, Garcetti stated that the city is on high alert. “There is no known, credible threat against Los Angeles from any terror organization at this time. We believe this was an intentional act. I want to reassure all residents that the LAPD and other agencies are fully engaged…No matter what happened, we will not let fear dictate our way of life…”  

In addition to the initial blast, investigators conducted a search of the area on Saturday and discovered a second device near the scene. A suspicious bag was found just two blocks from the original explosion site. The police department tweeted around 1:45 am confirming that the device had been safely neutralized. “A suspicious object located on Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake has been safely handled by the LAPD Bomb Squad.”  

Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore stated that the explosion was not caused by a gas leak, though they still have no clear explanation for what triggered it. The surrounding area is being treated as a crime scene while the investigation continues. “Our team is working aggressively to determine the cause. The area remains under close surveillance to ensure public safety.” Watch the video below to see the moment of the explosion and the chaos that followed. This is absolutely terrifying!

"Drugs can be a real nightmare that destroys everything you hold dear. They creep into your life, mess it up, and rarely let go. One of the latest dangers sweeping through the streets is a drug called K2…also known as Spice. It’s marketed as a legal alternative to marijuana, but it’s actually chemically manufactured, making it far more dangerous. A key thing about this drug is that it can send users into complete madness! There have been countless reports of people found in total disarray on the streets—some barely conscious, others screaming and panicking.  

Of course, there are many different variations of the drug, each offering a different kind of high. Some users say it's similar to weed with no real side effects, while others, like this guy, end up having terrifying experiences. In this case, he thought he was smoking regular cannabis—he even said, “Don’t tell me how to smoke weed, man.” He had no idea it was actually Spice. At first, he felt relaxed and happy, but then things took a dark turn. His perception of reality twisted, and he started acting strangely.  

What was supposed to be a joke turned into a disaster. He was seen stumbling around, falling over, while those nearby laughed and took advantage of his condition. The video ends with him lying motionless on the ground, surrounded by people who just walked away muttering. Drugs can turn even the most normal person into a complete mess. This video is a warning—stay away from Spice, or you might end up looking like something out of a horror movie.",1
"I love Texas! I mean I really love their spirit. They’re like the honey badger, they just don’t care what others think. Governor Abbott is the real deal because he stands up for his people—even if it means going against Joe Biden. On Tuesday, Abbott announced that Texas will no longer take part in Biden’s refugee initiative due to serious security risks. The governor has every right to be worried, especially after a string of violent incidents across the country this week. Abbott doesn’t want to gamble that the under-reviewed refugees coming into Texas might have extremist views. The Texas Refugee Task Force sent a 120-day notice of their decision to pull out. The Office of Refugee Resettlement stated in a press release that their integration programs only begin after thorough security checks. Unfortunately, the current refugee processing system is full of loopholes and has already allowed several extremists into the U.S. “The federal refugee program is in serious disarray and poses a threat to our country,” Abbott said. “The FBI and the Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly warned that they can’t fully vet refugees from countries linked to terrorism. Despite this, President Biden is pushing to bring in even more refugees, putting American citizens at risk.” “While most refugees are harmless, some are dangerous—like the Afghan refugee arrested last month for planning an attack in Dallas,” Abbott added. “Texas has asked the federal government to fix this problem, but they’ve failed to tell the difference between a threat and a regular immigrant. We won’t stand by while this happens.” “So Texas is pulling out of the resettlement program. I urge the federal government to fix this broken system before more lives are lost,” he concluded. Take that, Mr. President!",1
"Tony Stewart is still battling to stay in the Chase, and the odds are not looking good. Tony Stewart's season has been anything but straightforward. Starting off with a major setback due to a wrist injury, he has managed to make a strong comeback and is now in contention for the title. Over the years, Smoke has been at the center of numerous controversies. From being accused of intentionally causing crashes to being involved in an incident that led to a driver's death, his career has had its share of dark moments. These experiences can really wear on a person. Still, Tony finds ways to give back in remarkable ways. Recently, it appears that Smoke’s generosity once again made a difference. According to a racing team paramedic, Jason Reynolds, Tony Stewart’s donation of safety gear helped save his life. Reynolds has worked as a first responder for many years and has witnessed the dangers of racing up close. He’s also been on scene during several of Tony Stewart’s crashes. Now, the roles have switched. Reynolds was responding to an accident on a local dirt track when he lost control of his ATV, sending him flying into the air and crashing onto the ground. You might be wondering how Tony Stewart is connected. A few years earlier, Reynolds responded to one of Stewart’s wrecks and claims he saved his life. That’s how Stewart felt, at least. As a gesture of gratitude, Smoke purchased high-quality safety equipment for Reynolds and his team. That gear, including a helmet, is what Reynolds says kept him alive. “I think I swerved to avoid something and lost control, which sent me flying off the ATV and hitting my head pretty hard. I’m convinced this helmet saved my life. We all think we’re invincible in our jobs, but no matter how prepared you are, accidents happen. You never know when it could be your last day. Love your family, live every day like it’s your last.” It’s incredible. Tony hasn’t commented on the incident yet, but we can only imagine how he feels about it. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jason Reynolds and his family as he recovers from this ordeal!",1
"Sheriff James Whitmore For the majority of ordinary citizens, it wasn’t too long ago that hearing the phrase “All Lives Matter” was seen as a positive, inclusive message, emphasizing that every person's life holds value regardless of race, gender, or background. However, in recent years, this once-neutral statement has been twisted and redefined by the politically correct elite, who have injected new meaning into the words. It seems that progressive activists and identity politics advocates have successfully transformed common phrases into tools for division, often distorting their original intent. This is where Sheriff James Whitmore of Jefferson County finds himself entangled. The sheriff recently placed a full-page ad in the local paper with the message “All Lives Matter,” which has sparked intense backlash from the usual critics. Whitmore explained that he ran the ad because he believes in the original meaning of the phrase, saying, “I remember when someone called ‘All Lives Matter’ a racial slur, and it really bothered me. Everyone’s life matters—yours, mine, the police, and every citizen. It doesn’t matter what color you are.” Most Americans likely share his view, but within the current political climate, stating “All Lives Matter” is now considered offensive by some progressive circles. Jo Welter, chair of the Community Race Relations Coalition, argued, “While you can say ‘All Lives Matter,’ the reality is that black lives have historically been valued less than others.” He then selectively presented data to support his claim. State Representative Laura Bennett criticized the movement, stating, “Black Lives Matter is divisive and harmful. It doesn’t address real issues—it just creates more tension.” Sheriff Whitmore added, “I know of no officer who puts on their uniform intending to harm anyone. There have been Black officers killed in the line of duty. This movement against law enforcement is completely misguided.” Sgt. Marcus Cole, a Black officer who does not support BLM, echoed similar sentiments. “Some people in the BLM movement don’t support police at all,” he said. “I’ve had this conversation with my own brother. If Michael Brown had cooperated, maybe things would have turned out differently. Or take Eric Garner—he could have gone to jail instead of being arrested. I don’t see that as police fault.” Do you believe the sheriff’s ad is a valid statement or an offensive slight to the black community? Share your thoughts below. Source: Jefferson Gazette",1

"In a highly charged segment on MSNBC, Trump was confronted about his past remarks labeling Hillary Clinton as a ""bigot."" When pressed for specific reasoning, he struggled to provide a coherent explanation. Instead of addressing the question directly, he attempted to shift the conversation, which only made him appear more erratic. Here's the exchange:  
  
Rachel Maddow: You've previously called Hillary Clinton a bigot. What makes you say that?  
Trump: She's a bigot.  
Rachel Maddow: But why? Bigotry involves prejudice against a specific group.  
Trump: She doesn't support those communities.  
Rachel Maddow: (Again) So, are you saying she has hatred or disdain for Black people?  
Trump: Her policies are bigoted.  
Rachel Maddow: But you said her policies are ""personally bigoted.""  
Trump: Oh, she is. Of course she is. There's no doubt about it.  
Rachel Maddow: But that suggests she has animosity—hatred, perhaps—toward African-Americans. Are you implying that?  
Trump: Maybe she's just lazy.",1
"This video is wild! While I don’t agree with the message, it still highlights how extreme some parts of the Black Lives Matter movement have become. Before I show you the clip, let me make one thing clear: the Black Lives Matter movement isn’t really about supporting black people—it’s more about dismantling the current system and replacing it with something entirely different. Their platform calls for defunding all police departments, demanding race-specific reparations for events that happened centuries ago and don’t affect anyone alive today, giving voting rights to undocumented immigrants (something no other country allows), ending private schools and charter systems (as if public education isn’t already failing), a universal basic income—essentially welfare under a new name—and free college only for black students (which shifts the burden onto others). So basically, someone stands on a street with a Black Lives Matter sign and nothing happens. Then they hold up an All Lives Matter sign, and suddenly everyone loses their minds. People act like they’ve been personally attacked. One person shouted, “All lives don’t matter, only black lives matter.” That’s seriously disturbing when groups start believing that. After watching the video, I scrolled through the comments and was shocked by how uninformed some people were. One claimed America had slavery for 600 years. I told them 2016 minus 1492 doesn’t equal 600. Another said whites created racism, so I reminded them who actually brought enslaved Africans to the U.S. Check out the video… based on what I’ve seen from BLM protests over the last few years, I’m not surprised.",1
"When you WATCH this VIDEO, you’ll want to have a box of tissues nearby. As I kept watching, I couldn’t stop crying. The video begins with a man addressing people who support Black Lives Matter, saying, “This is for all of you who shout ‘Black Lives Matter’ but never talk about the black-on-black violence happening in our communities every single day. Until you start protesting that, shut the f**ck up and stop making noise.” To back up his point, here are some shocking statistics from the Uniform Crime Report’s Supplemental Homicide Reports, which show why this issue is so serious. These numbers reveal why some people feel that black individuals are responsible for a large portion of violent crime: ⦁ Although only 6% of the U.S. population is black and male, they accounted for 58.2% of those killed by private citizens in self-defense. ⦁ In 2009–2012, 74.3% of black males killed by civilians in self-defense were killed by other black individuals. ⦁ 43.1% of all homicide victims from 2009–2012 were black males. ⦁ 89.4% of black males killed in criminal homicides during that time were killed by another black person. ⦁ 41.3% of police officers murdered in the line of duty between 2009–2012 were killed by black males. In 2012, white males made up 38% of the population but committed 4,582 murders. Black males, at just 6.6% of the population, committed 5,531 murders. That means, despite being a much smaller group, black males committed nearly 1,000 more murders than white males. These facts expose a grim reality that many ignore: Black men, especially young ones, are far more likely to come into contact with (mostly white) police officers, increasing the risk of deadly encounters. This dynamic creates a dangerous situation. For nearly 30 years, black Americans—just 13% of the population—have been responsible for over half of all homicides in the U.S. According to DOJ data, from 1980 to 2008, blacks committed 52% of all homicides.

Expressing an opinion doesn’t mean the facts are lies—unless you’re one of those closed-minded liberals. I’ve also been told I’m too blunt and not politically correct. I grew up with the same attitude as Forrest Gump and Larry the Cable Guy: “Stupid is as stupid does,” and “You can’t fix stupid.” Smart people will learn from what I write, while the ignorant will do their own research. Ignorance can be fixed, but stupidity can’t. That’s why we had Obama—we let stupid people believe his lies. In the 80s, I stopped watching TV news when I realized it was all anti-Reagan propaganda. Reagan ended the Fairness Doctrine, which Democrats had used since Truman to control media content. Once that restriction was lifted, conservative voices emerged through Rush Limbaugh and FOX News. Rush gave a voice to the Silent Majority who had been silenced. With both sides presenting their views, the Moral Majority could finally debate liberals openly. That’s why the Left wants to bring back the Fairness Doctrine—to shut us out again. It's not about fairness online, it's about censorship. This is the truth the Left doesn",1
"The incident at the Ohio shopping center last week was fueled by the failure of Muslim immigrants to integrate into American society. The suspect, a 24-year-old university student named Omar Farooq, is a Sudanese-American who had lived in the U.S. for over a decade. He attacked five shoppers before being subdued by a retired firefighter who was carrying a concealed weapon. As expected, it took a good guy with a gun to stop the violence. It's baffling that it took the media days to label this as an Islamic extremist attack, even though the attacker was heard shouting “Allah Akbar” during the assault. Did they really think he meant “God bless America”? Probably not. According to reports, Farooq and his family had lived in the U.S. for years without making any effort to adopt local customs or learn English. As the Daily Wire noted: ""Farooq’s mother, Amina Farooq, told reporters through a translator that she had no idea her son was involved in terrorism."" She explained that he was born in Sudan and moved to the U.S. 13 years ago. The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility, calling him a ""jihadi fighter"" who acted in response to Western military actions. Farooq’s mother, speaking through a translator, said she had no knowledge of his radical views. She added that he came to the U.S. 13 years ago after growing up in Sudan. The debate over immigrant integration has been fierce, with critics arguing that many refugees from the Middle East and Africa show little interest in embracing American values. @AnnCoulter Assimilation is a myth—after 15 years, they still don’t speak English, they want to reshape the country, not be part of it.

"There’s a reason that it’s called terror. It’s because groups like ISIS and other extremist organizations use fear and manipulation to control people and push their radical agenda. Their goal is to force others into submission under their ideology, and anyone who resists is labeled as an enemy and threatened with severe consequences. These groups even publish lists of people they consider threats, targeting them for elimination based on their beliefs or lack thereof.  

While the idea of being marked as a target may be terrifying for many, the U.S. Army doesn’t flinch. In fact, they see it as an opportunity. If terrorists want to attack, they’ll have to face the full might of the military. Rather than cower, the Army is openly challenging these groups, showing no fear and even taunting them. A recent campaign of billboards has been launched across the country, sending a clear message: the military is prepared for any threat.  

With so many terrorist incidents reported in recent months, this bold statement from the Army couldn’t come at a better time. Naturally, some political figures opposed the move, claiming it escalates tensions and undermines diplomacy. But what do they know? This message directly counters the core of the terrorist strategy—fear. By standing firm, the military proves that they are not only unafraid but ready to fight back. If we don’t fear them, then they lose.  

Sorry, extremists. The war has already begun. Share this post if you support our soldiers’ courage!",1
"The Democratic push to investigate the IRS commissioner for allegedly shielding conservative groups backfired dramatically when Republicans, offended by being dragged into a political spectacle, turned the tables. During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s hearing, Republicans focused less on the ""impeachment"" accusations and more on exposing Donald Trump’s financial misconduct, including specific inquiries about his tax returns and potential fraud in his charitable donations. A key point of contention was Trump’s claim that he can’t release his tax records because he’s under audit. Financial analysts have consistently dismissed this reasoning, pointing out that an audit doesn’t block someone from disclosing their taxes before an election. The IRS chief, who should know better, confirmed this. “Is there anything preventing someone from releasing their tax returns while under audit?” Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, asked. “No,” Koskinen replied. Another Democrat rephrased the question: “Would releasing tax returns during an audit interfere with the process?” Rep. Ted Deutch asked. “Not directly,” Koskinen explained. “The concern is that once the information is public, more details might come to light.” In other words, Trump fears that revealing his taxes could expose hidden issues or allow journalists to uncover additional wrongdoing. This aligns with what Trump’s son previously told reporters—this isn’t about the audit, it's about what might be found. It’s likely why Trump has suggested releasing his returns only after the election, though it would be too late. The Democrats then pressed Koskinen on other potentially damaging revelations, such as Trump’s true income, tax payments, net worth, and charitable activities. Rep. Zoe Lofgren questioned whether Russian payments could indicate a motive for softening U.S. policy toward a rival. Others highlighted reports that Trump used his tax-exempt foundation to buy art, sports memorabilia, and fund political campaigns. “Is it proper for a foundation to make political donations?” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee asked. The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, visibly amused by the Republican discomfort, nibbled on a bag of Skittles—a subtle jab at Trump Jr.'s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy. He later clarified that he wouldn’t stop eating them even if one was bad. It wasn’t a good day to be a Republican. The IRS commissioner was facing a Republican-led impeachment over alleged IRS bias against conservatives, despite no real evidence of such targeting. The whole charade",1
"To close out a week in which law enforcement killed two unarmed Black individuals, a police officer in Alabama has been taken into custody after it was revealed that she had made up a story about being attacked by a Black man. Officer Maria Delgado from Montgomery has faced charges including “false reporting, tampering with evidence, and violating her official oath.” “After thorough investigation, we have determined there was no active suspect at large in Montgomery,” stated investigator David Hayes during a press conference. Delgado claimed that on October 5th, a Black man had shot her through her vest, but investigators found that the entire incident — including the radio report, torn uniform, and bullet casing — had been staged. This case highlights the growing distrust in official narratives. When a protester was fatally wounded during a protest in Minneapolis, authorities quickly labeled it a civilian shooting, yet several witnesses reported seeing a police officer fire a beanbag round. A video of recently deceased Black man George Johnson showed a gun near his body — but a version released by his family shows no weapon, only a cop dropping a badge. In a similar case, a police officer in Kansas City was recently charged with murder after it was uncovered that he shot a Black man and then planted a firearm on the scene. In an era where truth is increasingly questioned, we must insist on verifiable proof. We can no longer accept statements at face value — whether from law enforcement or public figures.",1
"From the New York Post: A man arrested on Tuesday in connection with the recent explosion in Brooklyn filed a legal complaint against his local police department over allegations of anti-Muslim bias. Mohammad Ali Hussain sued authorities in Newark, N.J., where he had been living prior to detonating devices at a subway station in Manhattan, a shopping mall in Jersey City, and near a local mosque. He claimed law enforcement was targeting him and his family because of his faith, citing “unfair treatment” and “religious profiling,” according to reports from the BBC. Hussain worked at a family-owned pizzeria called Liberty Pizza, which his parents said faced constant harassment from officers who issued “unwarranted” citations and spread rumors that “Muslims are not welcome here.” The lawsuit was filed jointly by Hussain, his father Khalid, and his brother Yusuf. He was taken into custody after a confrontation with police, during which he was found unconscious outside a convenience store in Elizabeth.

"It’s no surprise that late-night host Trevor Noah, known for his sharp wit and political commentary on *The Daily Show*, has never been a fan of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Naturally, he couldn’t help but take to Twitter during the first general election debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The entire night was a series of scathing jabs at the former real estate mogul. Here are some of his standout remarks:  

""Republicans won the 'unqualified' award when they picked an orangutan as their candidate.""  
""As long as he doesn’t throw his snacks, 'Surprisingly dignified Trump last night' — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

""Wish Hillary would just say, 'The Russians gave me your tax returns,' just to see if Trump loses it.""  
""Trump adjusting his Spanx again, and one last spritz with the Final Net… — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

""Trump proud of himself for calling her 'Secretary Clinton' — as if 'Bitchula' sounds any better?""  
""Trump wearing a tie made in China, just saying… — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

""OK, I hope she's using rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because this vile little bully is getting old.""  
""Trump: 'Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we should take the oil.' We’d have to be back in Iraq to take the oil! They won’t give it to a drone — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

""By the way, you know a charge against Trump is 100% true when he cuts in with 'Wrong!' #debates — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

""And, of course, for his closing remarks, Noah went full force, hitting those who refused to support Hillary:  
""However this goes, I have so little respect for the voters — it’s this close. She should be 50 points ahead."" — Trevor Noah (@TrevorNoah) September 27, 2016""  

But he saved his best punchline for last, calling Trump",1
"There has been growing debate over the fatal shooting of Keith Scott by Charlotte police. According to the police department, the incident was justified as Scott was in possession of a firearm and posed a threat to officers. However, supporters of Scott claim he was simply waiting for his children at the bus stop and was holding a book, not a weapon. The truth remains unclear, but new information from Scott’s wife could provide further insight.  

Investigations into Scott’s past reveal that his wife, Rakeyia, had previously filed a restraining order against him, alleging physical abuse. She claimed he had threatened to kill her and had a gun. In the form, she noted, “He hit my 8-year-old daughter in the head with his fist… He kicked me and said he would kill us with his gun. He called himself a ‘killer’.” When asked if law enforcement should consider him a danger, she responded “yes” and specified, “He carries a 9mm black.” The order was submitted on October 9th, 2015, but was later withdrawn by Scott’s wife just days later. This detail seems to support the police’s assertion that Scott was armed and dangerous.  

Police have released dashcam and bodycam footage from the incident, along with images of the gun found on Scott. The weapon is reportedly the same one stolen from a home during a break-in. Officers also disputed the claim that Scott was peacefully waiting for his children. They initially noticed him rolling a joint, which they didn’t immediately prioritize. However, when they saw him hold up a gun, they became concerned. The officers, who were initially in plain clothes, then put on marked vests and repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon. He refused. DNA and fingerprints matching Scott were found on the loaded gun, reinforcing the police narrative.  

Once again, this incident has sparked controversy, with critics accusing the Black Lives Matter movement of using a legitimate police action to incite unrest under the guise of “justice.”",1
"Republicans have been breaking ranks to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this year’s general election, with a level of cross-party backing unseen in recent decades. Now, according to a report from The New York Times, the most high-profile switch yet comes from former President George H.W. Bush, who reportedly told a close associate that it was time to publicly endorse Clinton. At 92, Bush had planned to remain neutral in the contest between Clinton and Donald Trump, reflecting his discomfort with the GOP candidate. However, his preference for the wife of his predecessor, Bill Clinton, eventually became public through a conversation with Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and former Maryland lieutenant governor. The Bush family has felt personally affected by the Republican Party's alignment with racially charged rhetoric under Trump, especially after Jeb Bush married a woman of Hispanic descent and learned Spanish. It’s not surprising that the eldest member of the Bush family would openly back Hillary Clinton early on. Both major conservative newspapers in Texas—Houston’s *Chronicle* and Dallas’ *Morning News*—had already endorsed Clinton long before this year’s presidential debates, which are set to begin next week. For the elder statesman, it must be comforting to know that Clinton’s extensive national security background and diplomatic connections are unmatched by any candidate in recent memory. While George H.W. Bush won’t be the only prominent Republican to support Clinton this election cycle, his decision carries weight due to his longstanding credibility.",1
"A border isn't just about keeping out undocumented immigrants—it's a crucial line of defense for national security. Historically, countries have built barriers to protect against external threats, not just migration. For example, the Great Wall of China was constructed to defend against invasions, not to stop people from entering. Today, our southern border faces similar risks. Many in Mexico are controlled by powerful drug cartels that have caused more violence than some terrorist organizations. If groups like ISIS want to enter the U.S., they’d likely use the unsecured southern border as their entry point. In fact, there are growing concerns that they're already making attempts.  

According to a report from The Conservative Tribune, eight Syrian nationals were caught trying to cross into the U.S. from Mexico on Monday, sparking renewed fears about homeland security following the Paris attacks. Breitbart cited two anonymous federal sources who claimed the Syrians were stopped at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has not officially confirmed the incident, Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, said his organization has received multiple reports from agents about Syrians being detained in the area. ""Agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended from other federal officials,"" he stated. ""I can't confirm or deny it due to security protocols.""  

If the administration allowed Border Patrol to operate without restrictions, it would be much easier to prevent such threats. Garza, speaking on Fox News earlier this month, revealed that “eight out of ten individuals caught entering the country illegally are not deported and remain in the U.S.” He added, “We’re doing the best we can with the limited resources available.” A strong, secure border is essential—and only one presidential candidate is committed to making that a reality.",1
"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had a series of sharp exchanges during the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Tuesday night in Hempstead, New York. Here are some of the standout moments:  

Prepared? ""I think Donald criticized me for being ready for this debate. And I was. You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to lead this country. That's what I'm here for,"" Clinton said.  

Trump on 'birtherism' ""I got him to show his birth certificate,"" he claimed regarding President Barack Obama.  

Trump on his temperament ""My greatest strength is my temperament. I have a winning personality,"" Trump stated.  

Trump's comments on women ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs, and dogs, who has said pregnancy is a burden for employers, and who has claimed women don’t deserve equal pay unless they work as hard as men,"" Clinton accused.  

Trump on taxes ""That makes me smart,"" Trump replied when Clinton suggested he might not pay federal income taxes.  

How rich? ""Maybe he's not as wealthy as he claims... There's something he's hiding... Who does he owe money to?"" Clinton questioned about Trump's financial secrets.  

'Good to be with you' Clinton greeted Trump with a smile: ""Donald, it's good to be with you.""  

'Trumped Up, Trickle Down' ""I call it 'Trumped Up, Trickle Down' because that's exactly what it would be,"" Clinton said about Trump’s economic strategy.  

MacArthur on ISIS plans ""I don't think Gen. Douglas MacArthur would approve of that,"" Trump responded to Clinton’s claim that she shared her plan to fight ISIS online.  

""Why not?"" Clinton: ""I expected by the end of the night to be blamed for everything."" Trump: ""Why not?""  

Trump on IRS audits ""I don't even mind it. It's almost normal now,"" he said about being audited.  

Clinton on her emails ""I made a mistake using private email,"" Clinton admitted. ""That's for sure,"" Trump added.  

""Own reality"" ""Well, Donald, I know you live in your own world,"" Clinton said after Trump attacked her trade policies.

"I can't wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s sycophantic media allies have already drafted the script. If this woman, God forbid, collapsed and died on the street tomorrow, these eager cheerleaders—these media prostitutes whose public credibility has hit rock bottom—would unquestionably repeat the Clinton campaign's line and call it a “minor setback” in her “inevitable” path to victory. The American people aren’t fooled. This is a seriously unwell woman. No more “conspiracy theory” nonsense. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild flu,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “a rare form of pneumonia”—which apparently requires a constant personal physician and a mysterious figure who appears whenever she experiences one of her sudden and unexplained “episodes” (or simply freezes up mid-speech with a brain “short-circuit”)—has been seen with the Clintons during medical emergencies dating back to 2003, when Hillary suffered a brain hemorrhage (also hidden). This man carries what some medical professionals believe is a Valium pen. Valium is an IV medication used to treat seizures. Blue-tinted glasses similar to the ones Mrs. Clinton was wearing when she fainted are also worn by those with seizure disorders. These glasses are also associated with treating symptoms of Parkinson’s disease—a neurological condition many doctors suggest Mrs. Clinton may be suffering from (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological evaluation?). The Clinton team needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll hear the next time she convulses and collapses into the arms of calm Secret Service agents who seem to have seen this before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up again from the 25 miles she ‘walked’ yesterday.” The point is, once again, by covering up her health issues, Mrs. Clinton has only reinforced doubts about her physical and moral fitness for the presidency. She’s shown she can’t be trusted. She’s confirmed the concerns voters, as reflected in her historically low approval numbers, have had about her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own political ambitions and desire for power above everything else",1
"As more concerns emerge about Hillary Clinton’s deteriorating health, Donald Trump is gaining momentum like never before! He now holds his largest lead yet over “sick Hillary,” according to the latest Rasmussen poll. With the first presidential debate approaching, a growing number of voters are turning away from Clinton’s campaign, viewing her actions as unacceptable. This shift is sending shockwaves through the political world. The most recent survey shows Trump leading Clinton by five points, his strongest showing since mid-July. According to the Rasmussen Reports White House Watch survey, Trump has 44% support among Likely U.S. Voters, while Clinton stands at 39%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson captures 8%, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein remains at 2%. Another 3% support other candidates, with 5% still undecided.  

Last week, Trump pulled ahead by 42% to 40%, after previously trailing by four points. His current numbers match his highest level of support from two months ago. Once seen as the inevitable winner, the Democratic campaign is now struggling under the weight of its own challenges. In a recent call with supporters, Clinton expressed confusion over her lack of a larger lead, asking, “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” This moment highlighted the growing frustration within her team.  

During a video conference, Clinton emphasized the importance of exposing Trump’s record, saying, “The choice for working families has never been clearer.” She urged her supporters to help spread the word. Here's the shocking clip:  

Hillary seems to believe she is guaranteed the presidency. As a long-time establishment figure, she struggles to understand why so many Americans — even some Democrats — are drawn to Trump’s unconventional style. Clinton embodies the old political order, filled with corruption, while Trump remains untainted by special interests. As more information comes to light about her health, Trump’s lead is expected to grow. With high unfavorables, Clinton is finding it increasingly difficult to keep up.

"While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency paused work on a segment of the Keystone XL Pipeline, two additional oil projects are advancing. In 2016, the Obama administration approved permits for both the Bayou Bridge and Gulf Coast pipelines, and although construction has not yet started, planning and infrastructure development are already in progress. Recently, investigative journalist Sarah Mitchell from The Intercept brought attention to these projects, emphasizing their potential effects on local ecosystems and Native American lands. As Mitchell reported, the Bayou Bridge pipeline will transport crude oil from refineries in Louisiana to a terminal near the Gulf of Mexico, while the Gulf Coast pipeline will move oil from the Permian Basin to Texas ports for export. According to a report by The Guardian, the Bayou Bridge pipeline will pass through sensitive wetlands and floodplains, raising concerns about possible spills that could harm both wildlife and communities. The Gulf Coast pipeline, which is also 30 inches in diameter, will carry oil from West Texas to the coast, crossing through several environmentally fragile regions. “Both pipelines run through areas with high populations of endangered species and indigenous communities,” Mitchell noted. “The real question is: who is actually monitoring the environmental impact, and how transparent are these processes?” She added that the growing reliance on hydraulic fracturing to extract oil from Texas’ shale fields is a major concern. “With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the focus should be on the long-term consequences of these projects,” she said. A recent update from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) shows that no construction has started yet, but because both pipelines have received federal and state approvals, activists argue that legal challenges are becoming less effective. “The system is set up to favor big energy companies, not the people affected by these projects,” Mitchell said. She pointed to the recent protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline as an example of how grassroots movements can influence policy. “Civil disobedience may be the only way to slow down these projects when the regulatory process is so biased,” she concluded.",1
"What a total disgrace Mohamed Elibiary is. He's not just a radical, he's a dangerous one. After the explosion in Manhattan last night, instead of blaming the real terrorists—Jihadists who are clearly behind it—he went straight to Donald Trump, claiming he was responsible for the attack that injured 29 people. That’s hypocritical coming from a guy who was kicked off the DHS Advisory Council for being too extreme. He's linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and has openly claimed the U.S. is an Islamic nation, with an ISIS caliphate being unavoidable. This is classic… Islamists and leftists always try to shift blame onto others for their own actions. Here we go again. Trump had nothing to do with this any more than the moon has to do with tides. To suggest otherwise is a lie, a smear, and dangerously inflammatory. I remember he was on a plane at the time, which probably doesn’t matter. Pressure cooker bombs are the trademark of Islamic extremism—just like the Boston Marathon bombing. From The Federalist Papers Project: Because he’s obviously a lowlife, Mohamed Elibiary once again opened his mouth and claimed that Donald Trump was behind the New York City blast on Saturday. It doesn’t matter that he was fired from the Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council due to his extremist views. It doesn’t even matter that he said an ISIS caliphate was “inevitable” or that America is an “Islamic country.” All of that got him in trouble. Now he’s just a washed-up figure, trying to stay in the spotlight. Maybe that’s why he chose Saturday night to make that inflammatory statement—he’s the first and likely the only one to bring it up. This guy is full of hate. He despises America, Trump, and anything that isn’t Islamic. Three months ago, he attacked the Coptic Christian community in Egypt. When a well-known Coptic businessman supported Trump, Elibiary warned ominously that it would be “bad news for Copts in Egypt.” Yes, I know his type well—I have Coptic friends, and one is deeply connected in Egypt. That was a threat. He also spoke at a 2004 conference honoring the anti-American Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini. Elibiary is a dangerous radical Islamist and a complete scumbag.",1
"Federal prosecutors launched the first ""Bridgegate"" criminal trial by charging New Jersey Governor Chris Christie with the most serious offenses, despite the fact that his top aides are currently on trial. At least one death has been linked to the Bridgegate scandal by some media outlets. Although Christie is not a defendant in this week's court proceedings, the prosecutors' aggressive stance suggests they may still view him as the central figure in their three-year investigation, as reported by NJ.com. U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna described the traffic chaos that gripped Fort Lee starting on Sept. 9, 2013, and revealed that David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official who pleaded guilty last year, will admit he was the mastermind behind the plan. The prosecutor stated that Wildstein will testify that he and Baroni informed Christie about the scheme during the Sept. 11 memorial in Manhattan, when traffic was at a standstill. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so determined to retaliate against Mayor Sokolich that, during those critical moments alone with the governor, they boasted about the traffic problems in Fort Lee and the mayor’s inability to reach his office,” Khanna said. “This case is about abuse of power and a complete disregard for the residents of Fort Lee.” Last year, Trump accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate, but after Trump’s campaign manager defeated Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged total loyalty to the president, the two Republicans have grown close, likely bonded over shared meals at McDonald’s. Federal prosecutors are now trying to convict Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, both of whom held high-ranking positions under Christie. All parties involved — the defense, the prosecution, and the accused — agree that Christie was aware of the political retaliation against the local mayor. Defense attorneys argue that the George Washington Bridge closure, now known as BridgeGate, was covered up to protect Christie’s presidential ambitions, as he was already planning his 2016 run. They claim that Christie and his team orchestrated the cover-up, with one lawyer describing the situation as “throwing people under the presidential bus.” This is the first time prosecutors have directly implicated Christie, contradicting his claims over the past three years that he had no knowledge of the lane closures that caused massive gridlock in Fort Lee. As usual, the New York Times downplays the intensity of Christie’s previous denials. We found a rare video showing the New Jersey governor",1
"I don’t remember a Presidential campaign where the candidate’s health was constantly in the news. Hillary Clinton’s health has been a major topic, not just in the media, but also in the polls. The latest numbers show a decline in her support, mirroring what appears to be a decline in her health. Here are the key findings from the poll: • Over 40% of registered voters now believe Clinton is in “below average” or “very poor” health, according to a survey of 1,501 people conducted between September 12 and 13. This is a big shift from a similar poll at the end of August, which found only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar. • The percentage of voters who see Clinton’s health as “average” stayed steady at 28%. Meanwhile, the number of voters who think Trump is in “above average” or “excellent” health increased slightly, from 33% to 36% (only 22% feel the same about Clinton). • Most voters have heard something about Clinton’s health, with nearly 80% saying they’ve heard either a lot or some about her medical issues. Though she's only 68 years old, it's easy to mistake her for someone much older. My own mother is in her 60s and looks far younger than Clinton. Usually, looking older than your age is linked to drug use or serious illness. I don’t know if Hillary uses drugs, but I've started to wonder about her health. It's not one thing, but a series of odd behaviors that have raised questions. At one point, it was reported that she was on Coumadin, leading to rumors of a stroke. Later, it came out that her team researched Provigil, a powerful drug used for Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and MS. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught mentioning that Clinton was “confused and needed naps,” which likely led to consequences. Then there are the videos and photos of her appearing to faint, stumbling, and coughing violently. Recently, a new image surfaced showing her struggling to climb stairs alone. While this alone might not mean much, there are many other images of her being supported by others. Another photo shows her being helped up the steps. There are even videos where she’s physically held up while speaking. It’s rare to see a picture of her",1
"According to this, the Texas state legislature is facing backlash for drafting laws that unintentionally criminalize everyday parental actions. For example, a recent law prohibits any ""unauthorized"" contact with a child’s private areas, which could mean that parents who help their kids get dressed or give them a bath could be charged with a crime. This is the result of legislation that bans ""intentional or knowing"" touching of a minor’s genitals under 18. While the goal is to protect children from abuse, the wording is so vague that it now threatens ordinary parenting tasks. The Texas Supreme Court attempted to ease concerns by stating that prosecutors are unlikely to target parents engaged in innocent behavior. However, the ruling also placed the burden on defendants to prove they had no sexual intent—effectively reversing the presumption of innocence. This creates a dangerous precedent where parents could be pressured into pleading guilty to unrelated charges just to avoid the risk of being labeled a sex offender. As legal scholar Sarah Williams points out, the court’s reasoning fails to account for the reality of plea deals, which most people accept due to the stress and cost of going to trial. Now, prosecutors have a powerful tool to pressure parents into accepting deals, even for minor offenses. This decision has raised serious concerns about due process and civil liberties, with critics arguing that it turns everyday acts of care into potential crimes. Unless the U.S. Supreme Court steps in, Texas parents may soon find themselves caught in a system that assumes guilt rather than innocence. Trust the system, they say. But when the system itself is flawed, what’s left to trust?",1
"I came across a local news segment featuring a store called “Second Hand Hope.” It’s a chain of thrift shops that supports the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. What caught my attention was that in addition to selling used clothing and goods, they also offer free HIV and STD testing. That seems unusual. Why would a business associated with LGBTQ+ advocacy provide these medical services? Is there something about the sexual behavior of gay individuals that makes them more prone to these infections? I don’t think I need an HIV or STD test. Only people who engage in high-risk behaviors should be concerned. If a couple is married and only has sex with each other, they’re not at risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Rates of sexually transmitted diseases have risen among men who have sex with men, with increased cases of syphilis reported nationwide. In 2012, men who have sex with men made up 75% of new syphilis cases in the U.S.” It's clear that same-sex relationships, along with shared drug needles, pose significant health risks. The AIDS crisis of the 1980s should have been a wake-up call. There’s even an ad today that claims anyone can get HIV. If that’s true, then every business should offer testing. But they don’t because it would be offensive to the majority who don’t engage in such activities. Another sign that same-sex relationships are not natural is that they can't lead to biological children. Homosexual couples must rely on adoption or artificial reproduction.

"Famous TV personality and longtime news anchor Anderson Cooper found himself in a heated exchange this week with right-wing commentator and Trump-backing Pastor David Collins, who took to social media to criticize the press for not immediately labeling last weekend’s explosion in Chicago as an act of terrorism. Cooper, a native of the city, wasn’t going to let the Trump loyalist spread the same misleading rhetoric that the former president often uses following attacks in Western nations. He called out both the pastor and Trump for playing on fear and manipulating public sentiment for political gain. Cooper accused Collins of hypocrisy, pointing out that a man in his position should know better than to align with a leader who values power over truth.  

Donald Trump continues to act as if he’s above scrutiny, more concerned with maintaining his image than addressing real issues. Pastor Collins’ support for him is clearly self-serving, showing a willingness to ignore ethics for personal benefit. The suspect in the recent Chicago bombing and the placement of multiple homemade explosives in surrounding areas has been arrested.",1
"This is one that will make you proud that true heroes don’t care about the color of someone’s skin. A school incident was captured on video, but it takes a shocking turn from what you might expect in the first few seconds. One part will leave you angry at the cruelty of two aggressors, while another will challenge the idea that groups like BlackLivesMatter and the New Black Panther Party hold as much power as the media suggests. You’ll see how skin color doesn’t define loyalty or compassion, as these so-called hate groups would have you believe. The footage starts with a white student sitting alone on a school bench, scrolling through his phone, when suddenly two black students ambush him from behind. The first hit lands directly on his face, and he quickly falls into a defensive crouch. The bullies keep striking, trying to knock him down. It looks hopeless… until two students, a boy and a girl, step in to defend the victim. And guess who they are? They’re black.  
It shouldn’t come as a surprise to most Americans that these two individuals chose to help a white classmate. Skin color has nothing to do with kindness, and if you don’t believe that, you’re either a modern-day bigot or stuck in old-fashioned prejudice. That’s not what this country stands for. These two protectors didn’t care about the color of the victim’s skin. They saw someone being attacked and they stepped in without hesitation. These two are real heroes.",1
"You've likely come across the slogan, ""Don't like gun violence? Don't own a gun!"" During the civil rights era, a similar message might have read, ""Don't like segregation? Don't live in the South!"" Supporters claim that gun ownership doesn't affect most people, so others shouldn't interfere. It's between an individual and their choice. They argue that anti-gun activists shouldn't be able to impose their beliefs on everyone else. They shouldn't have the power—through laws—to ""force"" people to carry weapons they don’t want. So, since the issue only affects the owner—and the person who may be harmed, but that’s not the main concern—it should be up to the individual to decide what to do with their property. (Even though the harm isn’t always on the owner.) You could say the same about segregation. It didn’t impact anyone except the person enforcing it—and the person being segregated, but they weren’t seen as equal then (kind of like how some don’t view gun violence as a personal issue) —so if you don’t like segregation, good for you. Don’t enforce it. And don’t try to impose your views on others. Well, here’s one activist and leader of a gun control organization who’s drawing a parallel between gun regulation and segregation. Except, she’s arguing that restricting access to guns is like forcing people into a system of oppression. And allowing unrestricted access to firearms would be ""liberating"" for citizens. Here’s CNS News: Sarah Thompson, director of the Gun Safety Alliance, recently spoke before a Senate panel discussing gun control policies, comparing restrictive gun laws to past discriminatory practices. She stated that repealing these laws is about “giving people back their freedom.” When asked about the impact of current restrictions on low-income communities, Thompson referenced a previous statement by Senator John Davis (R-Tex.), who likened recent court rulings to historical segregation, saying, “It’s ironic that we’re bringing up segregation in this context. When you control someone’s choices, you control them.” “These laws are about giving people more options,” she explained. “They’re about returning control to individuals. It’s about freeing people from fear.” “When you get to decide whether someone’s life has value, you control them—whether you label them as black or white, you don’t get to make that decision,” Thompson said. “We are worthy, and people are worthy. These laws simply take",1
"(CNBC) The spectacle of political debates often veers away from substantive policy discussions — and the most recent showdown between Joe Biden and Elon Musk was no different, particularly when it came to global issues. The exchange between the two candidates highlighted more what was left unsaid — such as the ongoing crisis in Ukraine — than what was actually addressed. To be fair, the debate wasn't designed to delve deeply into foreign policy, which was barely touched upon in the ""global leadership"" segment. However, during the conversation on climate change, trade, and international alliances, there were a few hints at how the world might be shaped under a President Musk or a President Biden.

QUIZ: Which leader are you more likely to support?

Climate Change

Biden focused mostly on critiquing Musk's past decisions — ""he has vision, but it's not always practical"" — rather than outlining his own strategies for addressing global warming. This was especially evident during the climate discussion, which was brought up 18 times throughout the foreign policy portion of the debate. Biden emphasized the need to ""invest in renewable energy,"" ""partner with global leaders,"" and ""reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030"" — positions that closely mirror the current administration's approach.

MORE: CNBC's Fact Check Team examines Musk’s claims.

Trade Agreements

Musk criticized Biden for “making bad deals” with other countries, suggesting that the U.S. should ""stop giving away our resources"" and ""take back control of our economy."" He didn’t provide much detail about his own plan, aside from hinting that ""we should have included more focus on technology and innovation in those agreements."" When Biden pointed out that Musk lacked a clear strategy, he responded: ""You're telling the rest of the world exactly what you're going to do... No wonder you’re still playing catch-up.""

(Fact check: Trade deals have been a key issue since the 1990s, and Biden has been involved in several major negotiations.)

International Alliances

While the debate didn’t reveal much about Musk's foreign policy vision, his remarks on international partnerships were striking. ""I want to support our allies, but we're spending too much. We can't be the ones holding everything up,"" Musk said. ""We need to make sure they pay their fair share."" This statement sent shockwaves through many global leaders, signaling a potential shift toward a more self-reliant U.S.",1
"As more concerns emerge about Hillary Clinton’s deteriorating health, Donald Trump is making history! He now holds his widest lead yet over “unfit Hillary.” According to the latest Rasmussen poll, as more voters focus on the race, a growing number of Americans find Hillary Clinton’s controversial past unacceptable. This is causing major ripples within the political world. With the first presidential debate approaching on Monday, Trump has surged to a five-point lead over Hillary Clinton, his largest advantage since mid-July. The most recent Rasmussen Reports weekly White House Watch survey shows Trump at 44% support among Likely U.S. Voters, compared to Clinton’s 39%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson continues to hold 8%, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein remains at 2%. Another 3% support different candidates, and 5% are still undecided. (To view the survey questions, click here.) Last week, Trump narrowly surpassed Clinton 42% to 40%, after trailing her by four points the previous week. This week’s numbers match his highest level of support from two months ago. Once seen as the inevitable victors, Democrats and Team Hillary are now watching their well-funded campaign fall apart. During a recent call with supporters, Hillary Clinton questioned why she isn’t “50 points ahead.” This is a crisis: Clinton expressed confusion Wednesday about why she isn’t dominating her Republican opponent in the polls. After outlining key parts of her campaign in a video call with backers in Las Vegas, the former secretary of state asked, “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” “The choice for hardworking families has never been clearer,” Clinton said. “I need your help to expose Donald Trump’s record. No one should be fooled.” Here’s the shocking clip: Hillary clearly believes she is destined for the presidency. As a top establishment figure, she struggles to grasp why so many Americans — including some Democrats — are drawn to such an unconventional, unfiltered candidate like Donald Trump. Hillary embodies the old guard and political corruption, while Trump remains untouchable! As more details about Hillary Clinton’s health come to light, Trump’s lead is expected to grow. With high disapproval ratings, Clinton simply can’t keep up. What do you think about Trump’s impressive lead over Hillary Clinton? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",1
"Donald Trump took to the airwaves on Monday morning, placing blame for the recent attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, insufficient law enforcement screening, and the First Amendment. Conservatives, he claimed, often ignore the First Amendment and focus solely on the Second. While targeting refugees, it was revealed that the bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is actually a naturalized U.S. citizen. During a segment on Fox & Friends, a host asked Trump how he would prevent ""radicalized individuals"" from acting. In response, Trump pointed to ""freedom of the press,"" accusing media outlets of providing dangerous information. ""They're all talking about it so nicely because it's called 'freedom of the press,' where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these bombs I've seen,"" he said. ""They should be arrested for helping people build bombs. Instead, they say, 'Oh no, you can't do anything, that's free speech.'"" He added, ""The websites are doing the same thing — they should be arrested immediately. They’re encouraging violence, okay? But we don’t touch them because of freedom of expression."" Watch the full exchange around the 21-minute mark: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8] It’s important to note that incitement is already an exception under the First Amendment. Think Progress points out that proving such cases is difficult — a fact that may benefit Trump personally. Under a more lenient standard, he could even face charges for his own inflammatory remarks. Earlier this year, his comment about ""Second Amendment people"" potentially taking action against Hillary Clinton drew heavy criticism as a veiled threat. On Friday, he again called for Clinton’s security team to be ""disarmed immediately,"" suggesting, ""Let’s see what happens to her."" Trump has frequently criticized the freedom of the press. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter detained. The GOP nominee has also supported Vladimir Putin’s actions against journalists. When confronted by Joe Scarborough about Putin’s record, Trump said, ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader. Unlike what we have here."" Freedom of the press is a constitutional right. It shouldn't be up for debate, unless Melania Trump decides to sue bloggers for quoting sources. However, if you ask Donald Trump Jr., he claims political correctness is responsible for terrorist acts. His pinned tweet",1
"This incident took place in May, but its relevance has only grown with the expected arrival of 15,000 to 25,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East in the coming weeks. Law enforcement in Arizona stopped a vehicle driven by an undocumented woman from the Middle East. What made this stop particularly alarming was what was found in her car—detailed blueprints for a natural gas pipeline. This discovery has raised serious concerns about potential terrorist activity. While the reason for the traffic stop remains unclear, it’s clear that the authorities acted at the right moment. Reports suggest that hundreds, if not thousands, of Islamic immigrants are attempting to cross the southern border illegally. A recent report from Judicial Watch revealed that Mexican drug cartels are increasingly smuggling individuals from countries linked to terrorism into the U.S. Another study from the same organization indicated that extremist groups based in Mexico have started making plans to enter the country and scout out possible targets. The border is now a major security risk, and it's only a matter of time before a major attack occurs. This can all be traced back to President Obama and his policies supporting open borders. He wants America to follow Europe’s path, which is now destabilized by mass migration and Islamic extremism. From a source called Truth Today: Authorities in Arizona recently pulled over a vehicle, only to discover it was being driven by an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The situation escalated when officers found documents related to a gas pipeline in the car. Now, local officials are on high alert. Judicial Watch claims that a sheriff in Pima County stopped an “Islamic refugee” for an unknown reason. Fortunately, what began as a minor traffic violation led to a major discovery when agents uncovered pipeline schematics in the suspect’s possession. These plans are tied to the area near the town of Tucson, located just 20 miles south of the Mexican border and 45 miles east of Phoenix. Tucson is known for its high crime rates, economic struggles, and failing schools, making it one of the most vulnerable areas in the state. The region is also a key transit zone for drug trafficking, with large quantities of meth, cocaine, and heroin moving through the area. The media has ignored this growing threat, but it’s a serious national concern. This issue could determine the outcome of the upcoming election. Our leaders must prioritize national security, secure the border, and ensure that all incoming refugees are thoroughly vetted. Otherwise, we risk more lives lost",1
"What's happening with the NBA? What’s become of America’s most popular sport? The viewership has taken a sharp drop lately, though it hasn’t caused much real harm…yet. But what if fans finally lose patience with the league’s pro-athlete stance and 40% of them decide to stop watching? That’s what some are saying, and it all seems to trace back to players like LeBron James and Kevin Durant, who have spoken out against social injustice and refused to stand for the national anthem—some even raising their fists in protest, not fully understanding the meaning behind it. If this actually happens, it’ll be because of the growing influence of these activists and the leagues that support them. There’s a new online survey suggesting that 40% of fans would follow through on their threat. Of course, it’s just an internet poll, so don’t take it too seriously—but still, it’s worth noting. According to the survey, several factors are driving fans away. Some said the absence of star players like Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal was enough to turn them off, while others blamed the protests as a major reason for their disinterest. With ongoing tensions following recent incidents involving law enforcement, it’s unlikely the protests will fade anytime soon. But how long can this continue? What’s the ultimate goal here? Will the league finally crack down and punish players for disrespecting the flag, or will it keep catering to political trends? I’m betting on the latter.",1
"As many of our followers know, there has been growing concern about the physical condition of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in recent weeks. This has been fueled in part by an incident last week when Clinton appeared to have difficulty navigating a set of stairs at a community center in Manhattan. According to a video shared on social media by CNN reporter Dana Jacobson, who was covering the event, Clinton was leaving the Children’s Museum and heading down a short flight of steps when she seemed to pause, focusing intently on her balance and grip on the railing.

The clip shows Clinton walking slowly, pausing briefly as she descended, before finally turning to face the reporter and offering a brief, almost distracted response. When asked about her preparation for the upcoming presidential debate, she simply said, “I’m ready,” before quickly stepping into her motorcade without assistance. A Secret Service agent remained nearby, seemingly prepared to help if needed.

While it's possible that Clinton simply wasn’t paying attention to the reporter at first, the video has sparked renewed discussion about her overall health and mobility. Some have pointed to this as further evidence of potential medical issues that could affect her ability to perform in public settings. Others have suggested that her behavior may reflect a pattern of selective engagement with the press.

Share this video on Facebook and Twitter so more people can see Hillary Clinton carefully navigating a short staircase, seemingly focused on her footing rather than the questions being asked. What do you think about the way she handled this situation? Leave your thoughts below!",1
"There is a growing number of Americans who believe the Black Lives Matter movement is more interested in inciting unrest than in genuinely advocating for the safety and rights of black citizens. Matt Walsh of TheBlaze doesn’t hold back when he labels the group as “radicals” and outlines his reasoning with conviction. If you support the cause but disagree with the tactics, this might be the most important article you read today. He begins by examining the recent events in Charlotte, North Carolina. If you're unclear about what happened there, here's a quick summary: a black officer shot and killed a black man who was armed, leading to a wave of protests that turned into widespread looting and destruction of black-owned businesses. It sounds extreme, but Walsh argues it’s not far from the truth. He continues: That still doesn’t make sense. Why are they insisting Keith Scott was unarmed when the evidence clearly shows he had a weapon? And regardless of whether the shooting was justified, why are they chanting “white cops are evil” when the officer involved was actually black? Even if the officer were white — which he wasn’t — and even if all white cops were evil (a theological stretch), why are they destroying their own neighborhoods in response? And the most puzzling question of all: Why do we still call this kind of violence, chaos, and lawlessness a “protest”? It seems like an eerie pattern that every BLM “protest” ends in destruction. I almost said these demonstrations “turn violent,” but that’s not quite right. After watching similar events unfold in cities nationwide, it’s clear that violence and destruction are the goal, not just side effects. The media keeps repeating the same line — that these protests “started peacefully” and then “turned violent.” But that’s like saying a carjacking “began as a normal drive through the neighborhood” before the criminals opened fire. It may technically be true, but the whole point was always the violence. These so-called protests are not random acts of rage. They are organized, intentional, and increasingly destructive. They seem to be getting worse with each incident. Read the full piece here — it’s well worth your time.",1
"What emerged, however, was in structure and visual style reminiscent of previous debates — two candidates behind podiums — only this time featuring a veteran statesman and an inexperienced contender. And it was Trump, expected to shine with his usual flair, who at times appeared unsettled, one of several distractions that seemed more about how he delivered his remarks than what he actually said. The exchange didn’t exactly make for a commanding performance, especially in terms of political drama. But for those who believed that hosting ""The Apprentice"" would prepare Trump for this kind of setting, it turned out the skills required were quite different from what he needed on that night. Clinton, on the other hand, entered the debate with a clear plan: remain composed, calm, and seemingly unbothered by Trump’s statements, while slipping in a few well-rehearsed jabs. This included emphasizing that she had thoroughly prepared for the event, offering a sharp contrast to some of Trump’s off-the-cuff responses. There were also effective reactions, such as when she responded to one of Trump's long-winded answers by saying, ""Just listen to what you just heard."" Related: One thing Clinton and Trump didn’t debate: the debate itself. Trump, by contrast, who had faced numerous opponents during the primaries, seemed out of place in this one-on-one setting. With so many candidates on stage before, his aggressive style stood out; here, sharing the stage only with Clinton, it became harder to rely on his usual hit-and-run tactics. He interrupted Clinton frequently — initially to score points, but as the debate continued, those interruptions began to feel more like outbursts, as if the attack ads she had run against him (which he mentioned) were getting to him. Trump’s constant sniffing, which continued throughout, also served as a distraction — not a major issue in theory, but one that quickly became a target for online mockery. His attempts to dominate certain discussions caused some challenges for the third participant in this mini-drama, Lester Holt. Holt, the ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor, had perhaps the most difficult role imaginable, given all the anticipation leading up to it and the inevitable post-debate analysis. Holt performed adequately, occasionally fact-checking Trump’s claims — particularly when he tried to deny direct quotes attributed to him — and pushing him for concrete answers. Those moments when he challenged the candidate likely won’t sit well with Trump’s most loyal supporters, but Holt avoided the image",1
"An English man, Daniel Clarke, has been taken into custody and is set to face trial after putting up anti-halal stickers on meat at a supermarket in his home city of Manchester. Halal refers to the religious method of slaughtering animals according to Islamic law. Clarke strongly objects to halal practices, citing connections to both violent extremism and inhumane treatment of animals. The stickers stated, “Warning: Halal is brutal and supports radical groups #StopHalal.” Recently, an investigation by an animal welfare group revealed footage showing Muslims at a slaughterhouse in Lancashire using dull knives to cut animals’ throats, while also dragging and beating them during the process. According to a British anti-Islam advocate named Mr. Thompson, funds from halal meat sales often end up supporting extremist causes. Additionally, companies that buy halal-certified products are required to pay a religious levy. Despite these claims, the prosecutor in Clarke’s case, Emma Wright, argued in court that “one can criticize the treatment of animals without linking it to religion or terrorism.” As a result, Clarke now faces charges of “religiously aggravated damage” and will stand trial on August 15 (H/T Daily Mail). It seems that in the UK, speaking plainly about halal practices can be seen as inflammatory. One can only hope Clarke lived in America, where free speech protections allow people to share their views without fear of legal repercussions.

"President Obama is often highlighted for his impact on African American communities. He frequently references his upbringing on the south side of Chicago as a symbol of overcoming adversity. However, what many don’t realize is that he spent significant portions of his childhood in Indonesia and Kenya. Throughout his presidency, he has repeatedly claimed that his leadership has helped reduce racial divides. Yet, incidents like those in Ferguson, St. Louis, and Minneapolis suggest that tensions remain high. The Democratic Party has traditionally relied on strong support from African Americans, women, and Latino voters, often targeting these groups during election cycles. But not all members of these communities agree with the party's stance. Some are now voicing their frustrations online, particularly on Twitter. Here are some examples: @BlackPatriot123 @realDonaldTrump I'm tired of Obama's legacy being praised when things are getting worse!

Many users have pointed to the spike in violence and unrest as evidence of his failed leadership. Others criticized his decision to block the 9/11 bill allowing families to sue Saudi Arabia. A number of people also brought up the increase in shootings and the Iran deal as proof of his poor judgment. Just look at Twitter, and you can see that his legacy isn’t as positive as he claims—especially when it comes to law enforcement and national security. But for Obama, it seems his ego is more important than the real issues facing the country.",1
"Hillary Clinton's ground presence in Ohio is minimal. The video below reveals what was found. The Clinton campaign is said to be strong on paper. Hillary Clinton often highlights the size of her staff. Then there are the volunteers. Most voters know that Ohio is a key battleground state. At one point, it was reported that Clinton had over 681 paid workers, while Trump had just 68. With such a disparity, the Clinton team clearly holds an advantage, right? Additionally, although Trump has improved his local outreach, Clinton has continued to expand her workforce. Recent figures show the Clinton campaign now has more than 1000 paid employees. A Trump supporter heard about a door-to-door effort and decided to investigate. He arrived at an office with chairs arranged for a meeting. Only one person was inside. After a short while, a woman emerged and introduced herself. Apart from a few volunteers behind the counter, that’s what the Clinton operation looked like in that part of OH. When the Trump representative starts pointing out the realities of the setup, the response isn’t positive. If you can count your volunteers on one hand, you have a serious issue. This likely explains the ""enthusiasm gap"" that liberal media is struggling to explain. It also shows why Clinton hasn't been able to secure the state. Recent polls show Trump closing in or even leading. His fundraising numbers clearly reflect stronger support for Trump than for Clinton.",1
"President Barack Obama delivered what was intended to be his last speech to the U.N. General Assembly, and it sparked controversy with its pessimistic take on the effectiveness of military force in combating Islamist extremism across the Middle East. The speech suggested that despite America's global military dominance, the president seemed to imply that victory is unattainable. According to a report by Fox News, Obama highlighted the deep-rooted nature of militant groups within Islam that have fueled the rise of ISIS, questioning whether military action alone could ever resolve such conflicts. “If we are honest, we must recognize that no outside force can compel different religious or ethnic groups to live together peacefully for long,” Obama stated. He emphasized the need for “honesty about these conflicts” and urged the international community to support those working toward peace and reconciliation. While acknowledging that military efforts may play a role, he pointed out that in places like Syria, “there is no clear military victory to be achieved.” Obama called for a focus on diplomacy, aid delivery, and political solutions that promote mutual respect among diverse groups. You can watch the full speech here; the key section starts around 28:45. It’s hard not to question how this approach will succeed when leaders refuse to openly connect violence with radical Islam and instead criticize religious minorities while downplaying the threat from extremists. We also wonder how effective this strategy will be when leaders fail to treat all people—regardless of belief—with the dignity they deserve. It’s difficult to move forward if we label the right people as undesirable and the wrong ones as peaceful. Consider this carefully before the next election.

"A high-profile police shooting that occurred over the weekend in Kansas City, Missouri, has sparked intense debate and outrage from Black Lives Matter activists and progressive media outlets. A video captured from a drone showed a 35-year-old unarmed African American man, Marcus Johnson, standing with his hands raised as he was fatally shot by white officer James Carter, reinforcing the perception that law enforcement frequently uses excessive force against Black individuals who are not a threat. However, according to local news outlet The Kansas City Star, investigators found a bag of methamphetamine inside Johnson’s vehicle, which may have played a role in his actions during the encounter. 

Methamphetamine is known to cause extreme agitation, paranoia, and aggression, often leading users to act unpredictably and aggressively, even when confronted by law enforcement. In some cases, individuals under the influence of the drug have been reported to ignore pain and continue attacking officers despite being shot. Additionally, Johnson had a history of violent offenses, including multiple arrests for assault and drug possession, and was wanted for failing to appear in court on charges of drug-related crimes. His prior record suggests he may have been resistant to authority and unwilling to comply with police instructions.

Some witnesses claimed that Johnson appeared disoriented and aggressive before the shooting, which could have led Officer Carter to believe he was a danger to himself and others. The medical examiner is expected to release a toxicology report confirming whether Johnson was under the influence of meth at the time of the incident. Share this story on social media to raise awareness about the drugs found in Marcus Johnson’s car, which may have contributed to the tragic outcome. Do you think the presence of meth in his system changes the story? Let us know in the comments below!",1
"I love Texas! I mean I really love their spirit. They’re like the honey badger, they just don’t back down from a fight. Governor Abbott is the perfect example of a true Texan because he’s not afraid to stand up for his people—even if it means going head-to-head with Joe Biden. On Tuesday, Governor Abbott announced that Texas will no longer take part in the federal refugee program due to growing concerns over national security. Abbott has every right to be worried, especially after several violent incidents across the country this past week. He doesn’t want to risk allowing poorly vetted refugees into the state who might have extremist ties. The Texas Refugee Office sent a 120-day notice of their decision to withdraw. The Office of Refugee Resettlement responded by saying their integration programs only begin after thorough security checks. However, the current refugee screening process is full of flaws and has already allowed multiple extremists into the U.S. “The federal refugee resettlement system is deeply flawed and poses a serious threat to our country,” Abbott stated. “The FBI and the Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly warned that we cannot fully vet refugees from countries linked to terrorism. Despite this, President Biden is pushing to dramatically increase the number of refugees coming into the U.S.” “While most refugees are harmless, some are a real danger—like the Afghan refugee recently arrested for planning an attack in Dallas,” Abbott said. “Texas has asked the federal government to fix this problem, but they’ve failed to distinguish between safe and dangerous individuals. We won’t be complicit in this failure,” he added. “Therefore, Texas is pulling out of the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to fix this broken system before more lives are put at risk.” So there, Mr. President!",1
"Both 2016 presidential contenders had the opportunity to address the recent explosions in New York and New Jersey. The contrast between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was clear, even in these brief statements. Watch! See how different Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton responded to last night’s bombing in New York City. Trump said, “I just got off a plane and a bomb exploded in New York — nobody knows what’s happening,” he told a crowd at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “We’re living in a dangerous time. We need to be strong, smart, and on high alert.” These remarks were made mere minutes after the incident. In contrast, Hillary appeared disoriented during her statement, seeming confused and contradicting herself within seconds. At the 0:32 mark in the video, she mentioned, “I’ve been informed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as the attack in Minnesota.” Then, at 1:15, when asked if Trump was right to call it a bomb, she replied, “It’s important to understand the facts of any event like this. That’s why we need to support the first responders and investigators who are working to find out what happened.” Did she really not know that bombs cause explosions? It’s baffling. The gap in their composure and clarity is staggering. Hillary Clinton clearly isn’t fit to lead. She should step down and take a break.",1
"Obama’s presidency is drawing to a close, and millions of Americans are eagerly awaiting the day he leaves the White House. He once vowed to transform America for the better, but many believe he has instead left a trail of disappointment in his wake. It's hard to imagine his legacy being celebrated once he's gone, given that so much of what he put in place has failed. Yet, despite this, Obama continues to promote his record — and now he's urging Americans to defend his legacy by supporting a specific candidate.  

In a recent address to the Congressional Black Caucus, Obama referenced the Jim Crow era and slavery to push for voter turnout, suggesting that the future of progress depends on choosing the “right” person. He didn’t name the candidate directly, but his message was clear: support Hillary Clinton or risk undermining everything he stands for. “My name may not be on the ballot,” he said, “but our progress is. And there’s one candidate who will carry that forward, and another who’s built their campaign on opposing everything we’ve worked for.”  

He highlighted the strong African-American voter turnout in 2008 and 2012, warning that failure to mobilize would be an insult to his legacy. “If this community doesn’t step up, I’ll take it personally,” he said. “You want to honor me? Then go vote.”  

But facts paint a different picture. It was the Democratic Party that historically supported slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow. The Republican Party was founded to end those very systems. The first African-American members of Congress were Republicans, and it was Democrats who created the Ku Klux Klan to suppress black voting rights.  

Meanwhile, Obama’s record with the black community isn’t as positive as he claims. His administration cut D.C.’s school voucher program, limiting access to quality education for low-income families. Unemployment and reliance on food assistance have risen sharply, hitting black communities hardest. He’s done little to address the breakdown of the black family, the high rate of abortions among black women, or the alarming number of children born out of wedlock.  

So why is he still boasting about his legacy? It seems like he’s lost touch with reality.",1
"If there's one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it's that they're certain about what they don't understand. And what they don't understand could fill entire libraries, as seen in a recent exchange captured on the September 18 episode of Comedy Central’s *The Daily Show*. You might not fault these individuals for the wild theories they believe—many of these ideas originate from conservative media outlets like Fox News. But when given the chance, some Trump voters come up with their own outlandish conspiracy claims that even right-wing pundits might hesitate to endorse. Reporter Jordan Klepper attended a Trump rally and spoke with attendees, and what he heard was both shocking and bizarre. Trump once praised the “uneducated,” and Klepper found plenty of them gathered to hear from their leader. The first few people he spoke to were fixated on rumors about Hillary Clinton's health. One man insisted she has AIDS, which he claimed she caught from Bill. And where did Bill get it? “From messing around with Magic Johnson,” the man said. We assume he meant the former NBA player, not the ex-president’s, uh, “johnson.” It didn’t take long for Klepper to meet people who clearly live in a different reality. There was the man who believed Clinton has a secret twin, and when shown two identical photos of her, he confidently pointed to the one he thought was the fake. Then there was the person who claimed President Obama is Muslim because of the way he wears his necklace. This refers to an old myth that suggested Obama stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring during Ramadan, but there's no rule against Muslims wearing jewelry during the holy month—except in this person’s mind. So, the absence of a watch proves nothing. But the most outrageous claim came from someone who said Hillary has AIDS and questioned why Obama wasn’t in the Oval Office on 9/11. These people will be voting on November 8. Will you be? Here’s the video, via Comedy Central: Featured image via Comedy Central screen capture. Here’s another “enthusiastic” Trump supporter: according to authorities, he was planning to build a bomb targeting Muslims.",1
"People never know when to stop, do they? They just can’t let things settle on their own without trying to turn everything into a disaster. Well, maybe not “people” in general, but specifically Jamal Carter, a Christian man who was invited by the family of Michael Brown to address the aftermath of his death. Of course, he couldn’t just speak without thanking God and encouraging the demonstrators to take it further—like looting stores and setting fires, which, for some reason, they think is a proper way to ""fight systemic racism."" After declaring that black people “don’t see no fairness” (because grammar isn’t everyone’s strong suit), he said he wasn’t “telling our brothers and sisters to back down,” referring to the chaos that’s supposedly in the name of “equality.” You know, the same equality they’ve been denied? Or something like that. His speech apparently worked so well that, according to a conservative outlet, protesters in St. Louis were shouting “We’re like the Taliban!” That’s what we need—Christians exploiting angry citizens and fueling more domestic extremism. Can this guy be arrested for encouraging violence? Maybe for inciting a riot? Oh, what am I thinking… he’s one of the “protected groups” in America. The most the government would do is give him a job managing community outreach programs.",1
"Pennsylvania Republicans are pushing a bill through the state legislature that would take immediate effect, enabling voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump. First introduced in June, House Bill 29 would allow non-residents to observe polling places and challenge voters, potentially disrupting the voting process and creating delays that could prevent people from casting their ballots. In essence, it would formalize voter intimidation. As Adam Gitlin, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, warned earlier this month, poll watchers—especially those who target voters based on race or religion—could severely undermine the democratic process. “There's a real risk that untrained individuals will show up at the polls, not understand the rules, and engage in biased challenges,” Gitlin said. “This could lead to long lines, confusion, and a chilling effect on voter participation.” Conservatives aligned with Trump, known for their extreme views and insistence on enforcing a particular version of Christianity, are expected to target Black, Latino, and Muslim voters. And that’s precisely what Trump wants. “We’re going to watch Pennsylvania closely,” Trump stated at a recent rally. “Go into certain neighborhoods, observe, and make sure no one votes multiple times. If we do that, we won’t lose. The only way we can lose is if there’s cheating.” Trump even has a section on his website encouraging supporters to sign up as poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!” In response to Trump’s claims of election fraud, Pennsylvania Republicans added an amendment to the bill to make it effective immediately upon passage and governor’s approval. Originally, it was set to take effect 60 days after being signed. With polls showing a tight race ahead of the first debate, Pennsylvania has become even more crucial. But voter intimidation could shift the balance in Trump’s favor and impact races at all levels. In short, Trump and the GOP are attempting to rig the election by legalizing a form of voter suppression. And if this strategy succeeds in Pennsylvania, expect similar tactics to spread nationwide.",1
"If you’re like me, you're counting down the days until the Donald Trump – Hillary Clinton debate. Don’t get me wrong – as someone who cares about policy, I’m disappointed to see both candidates avoid substantive discussion. Trump speaks in blunt, no-nonsense terms that resonate with Americans frustrated by what they see as political correctness and a lack of leadership across all levels of government. Hillary, on the other hand, relies on manipulation, selective facts, and carefully curated messaging meant to keep her image intact long enough to secure another term in office. Still, the debate should be compelling — Hillary tends to unravel under pressure, while Trump thrives when challenged and pushed back against. Think about how he handled Megyn Kelly’s aggressive questioning during the 2016 primaries. It’s not just Trump that’s concerning; Hillary is entering the debate with a poll trend that continues to slide. While most polls showed her ahead after the primaries, they’ve been heavily influenced by biased sampling and questionable methodologies. The Real Clear Politics average currently shows her leading by just 2.3%. When you factor in the bias, it's likely a dead heat. Recent projections suggest that Trump is only one state away from a potential win in November. That means the race is still very much up in the air. Even the most confident analysts are starting to question the reliability of the data. FiveThirtyEight has dropped Hillary’s chances of winning from 71.2% on September 11th to 58.4% on September 20th. While polls may not always reflect reality (as seen with Karl Rove’s infamous predictions), the truth is that public opinion is turning against Hillary as more details come to light, while support for Trump has remained steady. Many people think this is a two-candidate race, but it’s really a three-way contest: Trump, Hillary, and “none of the above.” Trump’s base has been behind him for a long time — they see him as a catalyst for change. Meanwhile, some supporters of progressive policies are still upset about the way Bernie Sanders was sidelined, and their dissatisfaction doesn’t automatically translate into votes for Hillary. In a direct matchup, the race could be very close. But how many Democrats will simply stay home rather than risk being associated with a candidate who might lose badly? And if Hillary can't hold her own in the debate, will that finally make liberals reconsider everything Trump has been saying about her weakness and inability to",1
"This week, as Americans were shocked by a series of brutal attacks across the country carried out by extremist Muslim groups, the public was stunned to learn that the Obama administration is still pushing forward with plans to welcome 110,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East this year. During her campaign for the presidency, Hillary Clinton has promised to dramatically increase that number, pledging to bring in over 620,000 poorly vetted Muslim immigrants in her first term if elected. The logic behind such policies is baffling—there is no reliable system in place to screen these individuals for ties to terrorism, criminal records, or willingness to integrate into American society. Despite rising concerns about Islamic extremism on U.S. soil, both Obama and Clinton remain committed to their immigration agenda.

The top priority of any U.S. president should be the safety of the American people. Yet, many state leaders and local officials believe that security is being compromised. Several governors, including Texas’ Greg Abbott, have openly opposed the resettlement of Muslim refugees, citing incidents of crime and violence involving previously resettled individuals in places like Phoenix, Detroit, and Kansas City. Texas has now taken a firm stance, refusing to accept any more Middle Eastern Muslim immigrants, warning of potential threats to public safety.

With over two dozen states challenging the Obama administration’s immigration policies in court, the issue has escalated into a constitutional crisis. Governor Abbott’s refusal to comply represents a direct challenge to federal authority, echoing the principles of the Tenth Amendment and state sovereignty. This movement has gained momentum, fueled by frustration over what many see as unconstitutional executive overreach and a lack of accountability from the federal government.

As the nation grapples with the growing influence of radical Islam and the erosion of traditional checks and balances, state leaders are increasingly turning to legal and political tools to reclaim control. Organizations like ""Free Nebraska"" and similar groups in other states are advocating for a ""convention of states"" to address these concerns. With the upcoming presidential election seen as one of the most critical in history, the tension between federal power and state rights is reaching a boiling point.

If the current trajectory continues, the conflict could lead to further division, open resistance, and even violent confrontation. While many hope for a peaceful resolution, the signs of a deepening crisis are becoming impossible to ignore. The struggle for freedom and self-governance is intensifying, and the price of restoring America’s constitutional order may be high. As",1
"Donald Trump has just captured what may be his strongest poll of the general election season, revealing a growing lead over Hillary Clinton, with particular gains among African American voters that have stunned the Democratic Party. The latest ""USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times"" “Daybreak” poll released on Saturday shows Trump ahead by 6.2 percentage points, 47.5 percent to 41.3 percent, suggesting that Clinton’s recent health-related controversies—starting with her abrupt departure from a 9/11 event and followed by shifting explanations from “exhaustion” to “pneumonia”—are beginning to take a toll. More alarming for Democrats, however, is Trump's unexpected rise in support among Black voters, now at 21 percent, up from just 4 percent a week prior. Clinton, by contrast, holds 68 percent, far below the usual numbers for Democratic candidates. Notably, young voters—who once favored Clinton by a wide margin—are now showing an 8-point advantage for Trump, while those with only a high school education or less have shifted sharply in his favor, giving him a 20-point lead compared to single digits just weeks ago. While the LA Times poll has historically been more favorable to Trump than many others, this latest result—showing his broadening appeal and strong performance in key demographics—has sent shockwaves through the Clinton campaign and Democratic establishment. Some analysts believe that internal polling within the Clinton team had already flagged this shift before the release of the new survey. With the media reigniting the “birther” debate, it's clear that the race for the presidency is heating up—and the Democrats are scrambling to respond. Email Subscribe",1
"Conservatives often claim that Islam is a religion of peace and compassion. However, the truth is far more complex. While they criticize traditional values on issues like LGBTQ+ rights, they tend to overlook the harsh realities faced by gay individuals in certain communities. The growing Muslim population in Western nations is increasingly highlighting these contradictions. Many conservatives have supported the influx of Muslim immigrants into their countries, but the consequences have been alarming. In several European cities, elements of sharia law are beginning to take root, and for those who are marginalized by Islamic teachings, this is deeply troubling. A recent incident in Brighton, England, illustrates this concern. On Saturday, James Carter was walking with his partner, Daniel Reyes, when they were confronted by a man shouting racist and homophobic remarks. The situation escalated quickly — the attacker began physically assaulting Carter, hitting him repeatedly. Reyes described the scene: ""He was yelling things about being Muslim… James was screaming in pain. He’s normally so calm and kind — this guy shattered his nose with a metal pipe. He was recording the whole thing."" This wasn’t an isolated event. Just last week, another attack occurred involving a gay couple. Could it be a coincidence that as Muslim populations grow, so too do hate crimes? The evidence suggests a disturbing trend. From violence against LGBTQ+ individuals to rising rates of sexual assault, many are questioning the safety of Western societies. The link is clear: sharia law condemns homosexuality, and extremist groups like ISIS have carried out brutal executions of gay people. It's no surprise that increased Muslim presence has led to greater danger for LGBTQ+ individuals. The real question is whether any conservatives will finally acknowledge this reality — or continue to ignore it at the expense of public safety.",1
"Donald Trump is often criticized for his volatile nature, with many claiming it makes him unfit for the presidency. Let's examine his challenging personality and consider how it relates to leadership. Mark Mellman noted, “A key difference in character is far more impactful than differences in policy.” That’s why we focus on character first, rather than on past failures. Dr. Frank remarked, “Most of my colleagues believe he’s not crazy, but if he is, he’s crazy like a fox.” Dan P. Adams, who studies personality traits, concluded that Trump exhibits “extremely high extroversion paired with exceptionally low agreeableness—meaning he’s not typically caring, polite, or kind.” Anger may drive both his extroversion and lack of agreeableness. While anger can lead to hostility, it can also fuel a desire for dominance and public approval. Trump might be a more adaptable and practical leader, similar to Bill Clinton rather than Bush. Leaders with low agreeableness, like Nixon, may have advantages when navigating complex negotiations or managing conflicting interests. Many past presidents shared these traits. Lyndon Johnson led the pack, followed by Teddy Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. Trump's personality type is known as a ""Promoter."" Other notable Promoters include Ernest Hemingway, Winston Churchill, Grace Slick, George S. Patton, and Steve Jobs. ""They are fearless, optimistic, and willing to take big risks to achieve their goals. They thrive on challenge and can excel in high-pressure situations, making them excellent negotiators and entrepreneurs,"" says Dan Adams. Take Andrew Jackson, for example. His campaign was built around his image as a champion of the common man fighting against corruption and elite power. Strong-willed and quick to anger, Jackson was a polarizing figure. He often turned disputes into personal attacks and painted opponents as enemies. Yet behind his outbursts was often careful strategy. Jackson’s temper was infamous, and his boldness earned him powerful enemies who spread rumors about him. He usually controlled his rage, using it—and his fearsome reputation—as a tool to advance his goals. His opponents feared his outbursts, comparing him to a volcano that could erupt at any moment. Jackson believed the president should represent all citizens, not just the powerful. He entered office determined to combat corruption and economic issues he blamed on the upper class. Rather than disqualifying Trump, his",1
"Now that Donald has officially secured the Republican nomination, and with a strong chance of becoming President, many are wondering who he will appoint to his cabinet. This could be a major blow to Hillary’s political future, and a dream come true for many Republicans! It’s just like Trump to bring in top talent. In a recent interview, Dr. Carson revealed his thoughts on who he believes should serve as Trump’s Attorney General: Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). A fierce legal mind, Cruz could be the perfect choice to take on Hillary Clinton’s alleged misconduct! During an appearance on Fox News Radio, Ben Carson suggested that Cruz could be a strong candidate for attorney general, saying it might allow him to pursue legal action against Hillary. “He’d do a great job on the Supreme Court, or he could be a fantastic attorney general,” Carson told John Gibson. When asked if it would be wise for Trump to nominate Cruz to the Supreme Court, Carson responded, “He could start as attorney general, go after Hillary, and then move to the Supreme Court later.” Carson acknowledged that there are still “deep divisions” and that it may take time for things to settle. From The Hill It’s clear that Carson’s opinion carries weight with Trump, and this endorsement could make Cruz’s appointment more likely. Plus, it would be a way for Trump to align with conservative allies he once clashed with. Hillary is clearly worried! Either she wins, or she ends up behind bars. It’s strange, isn’t it? She either gets a high-profile job or faces jail time? What’s happening in this country?",1
"The demonstrators in Atlanta might believe they're fighting against systemic racism and police violence, but the real bigots in that area are the ones causing chaos. The state militia has been deployed after violent protests erupted following the death of a black man who police claim pulled a weapon from his vehicle. Over the last 48 hours, rioters have attacked a news crew, injured two officers, and set fire to several businesses, including a popular music venue. It’s clear that the life of the officer involved doesn’t matter—imagine if it had been a white cop killed instead. In Atlanta, both white residents and media personnel are being targeted without warning. For some odd reason, Joe Biden has aligned himself with these protesters in an effort to win over the Black Lives Matter movement, which is likely to hurt his campaign. Most African Americans don’t support BLM, so he’s only gaining support from a small group while pushing away the majority. If you're in Atlanta, there's a way to stay safe. As reported by The Daily Wire, a white woman managed to pass through a hostile crowd unharmed—because she held up her concealed firearm. She drove past a group of protesters shouting “End the Violence!” and holding signs that read “Stop the Cops!” As the crowd started to surround her, she reached for her gun and showed it to them. The tension instantly eased. Watch the video below: Deservedly so. I’m shocked that these riots continue into the late hours, disrupting traffic and making it hard for regular people to get around. Don’t these people have responsibilities to attend to in the morning? Oh, right… they probably don’t.",1
"The attacks are here, and they've been here for a long time. They aren't new, and they're not going away. With the right leadership and a government that's willing to stand firm when other world leaders are too weak to speak out, we could significantly reduce these threats. But that kind of leadership would have to admit that our current approach isn't working—it’s actually fueling more violence and loss of innocent lives. It would also need to reject the dangerous ideology of Political Correctness that has clouded our judgment and prevented us from seeing the real enemy. Unfortunately, such leadership doesn’t exist. Not while our leaders keep playing political games, trading favors and looking out for their own interests. Every day, the media, talk radio, and Hollywood focus on the latest scandals—whether it's the latest controversy from Joe Biden or the shifting stance of Kamala Harris—and a large portion of the American public is left wondering, “Are these really the best people we can choose?” The idea that a strong, principled candidate will come along and fix everything is just wishful thinking. We brought this on ourselves by electing officials who make decisions that affect all of us, from local communities to the entire nation. One of those key decisions is how we deal with terrorism. I say terrorism because, despite all the noise, we still haven’t agreed that the primary threat comes from Islamic extremists. After the recent attacks across the country, from New York to Ohio, it's clear: the war hasn’t ended. It's now being fought in our streets, our cities, and even within our own communities. Senator Ted Cruz has issued a powerful statement calling for a realistic response to the growing threat: “Terrorist attacks over the past few days, from Manhattan to Minnesota, show that we are entering a new stage in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, which are increasingly targeting the U.S. and Europe. A year ago, a decisive military effort in Syria and Iraq could have crippled ISIS, but instead, the group has spent the last year sending radicals into Western countries, disguising terrorists as refugees, and radicalizing Muslims online to attack here. At the same time, al Qaeda and the Taliban continue their efforts to strike America, just as they did on 9/11. We must stop treating these attacks as isolated events disconnected from the broader battle against radical Islam. It's time to stop pretending and clearly name the enemy: radical Islamic terrorism, which is w",1
"Police were called to a New Jersey middle school after a 12-year-old student said, ""Chocolate,"" while discussing desserts, his father claimed. Another student reportedly took the comment as a racial slur, according to the Bergen County Record. A staff member then alerted the authorities. “He was just talking about snacks,” said the boy’s father, Michael Thompson. “Who did he offend? I don’t understand why this became a police matter.” Thompson expressed concern about the school's handling of the situation, saying it has made him reconsider sending his son back next semester. “I don’t trust the staff anymore, and my son is scared,” he added. “There was a cop with a badge asking him what he said, and he didn’t know how to respond.” The police also spoke with the other student’s parents, and the case was forwarded to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Collingswood Police Chief Kevin Carey mentioned during a meeting with school leaders that they should report even minor incidents, including things like name-calling or slang that could be misinterpreted. “It’s not just about serious issues like weapons or drugs anymore,” Carey said. This new approach has led to more frequent police visits to the school, sometimes multiple times a day. “It’s just kids being kids,” said teacher Lisa Martinez. “I’ve never felt so unsure about how to handle something before.” The mayor, local police, and the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office held a meeting to address the growing concerns. “We made it clear that the Memorandum of Agreement hasn’t changed,” Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley wrote in a letter to the prosecutor’s office, as reported by the Collingswood Patch.

"HILLARY CLINTON TRYING TO PLAY THE VICTIM AGAINST THE STRONG AND POWERFUL TRUMP ISN’T GOING TO WORK WITH THE TERRORIST, LITTLE KIM IN KOREA, IRAN OR RUSSIA.",1
"I couldn’t stand the debate last night. From the start, I heard nothing but extreme liberal nonsense from Hillary Clinton. Then Trump jumped in with his usual protectionist rhetoric and talk of tariffs. Both are pushing socialist agendas. It was really hard to watch. Trump claimed he’d release his tax returns if Clinton released her deleted emails. I don’t think either will ever come forward. Both candidates also said they want to take Second Amendment rights away from people on the No-Fly list, which is a deeply flawed idea and completely unconstitutional. But the part about ISIS was especially frustrating. Trump made a huge mistake when he said, “No wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” to Clinton. ISIS didn’t even exist until 2003, after the Iraq War. Unless she’s a teenager, that was just plain wrong. Even worse was Hillary’s confusing statement where she said, “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” That’s exactly backwards. Robert O’Neill, a former SEAL who was involved in the Bin Laden mission, called her out on it. From the Independent Journal Review: During the debate, Hillary suggested we needed to “take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Veteran and former SEAL Robert O’Neill pointed out that this was the opposite of what’s happening. ISIS is spreading into Iraq, not the other way around. Clinton also implied she was involved in the Bin Laden operation. O’Neill corrected her, saying that Clinton and Obama had little to do with it. Lester Holt was terrible too. He never brought up Benghazi or the email scandal, and let both candidates make obvious mistakes without challenge. It was a total waste. Trump didn’t push Hillary on most issues, and they both stuck to their usual lines. One of them will be president, and honestly, we’ve brought this on ourselves. It feels like we’ve earned it. And don’t even get me started on Ted Cruz praising Trump’s weak performance. It’s really disappointing. Cruz chose this path, and now he’s stuck with it. I agree with SooperMexican: “There are no more heroes, only alcohol.” Looks like we’re headed for another boring, predictable disaster.",1

"Saturday, President Obama addressed the Black Congressional Caucus, offering a moment for unity during a tense period. While he had the chance to provide reassurance to the American public, he remained silent on the recent wave of attacks. As of Monday afternoon (East Coast Time), President Barack Obama has yet to make any public statement regarding the series of terrorist incidents occurring across the U.S. Over the weekend, several attacks carried out in the name of 'Allah' have left communities in shock, with dozens injured or killed.

I’ve watched Obama fail to take charge for almost eight years.

"Donald Trump has financial advisors who have crafted a strategy aimed at boosting economic growth. This stands in sharp contrast to the progressive economic model proposed by Hillary Clinton. The plan focuses on reducing bureaucratic hurdles, improving energy production, and reforming trade policies in a way that aligns with public interest. For more details, check out the full breakdown. As reported by Fox News: Donald Trump’s economic blueprint is projected to ""substantially boost America’s real GDP growth,"" according to a recent analysis by investor Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, a renowned economist from the University of California. “When viewed as a cohesive package, the Trump plan is fiscally responsible and does not add to the deficit,” Ross and Navarro state in their report. Ross, a leading figure in private equity, and Navarro, a key economic advisor to Trump’s campaign, argue that “this approach will drive economic growth more effectively than Hillary Clinton’s plan to raise taxes, expand regulations, limit energy development, and maintain deep trade imbalances.” In contrast, Trump’s proposal includes tax reductions, fewer regulations, lower energy costs, and a focus on eliminating long-standing trade deficits. The report concludes that “Hillary Clinton’s policies would hinder economic expansion.” It further notes that Clinton’s plan “calls for higher taxes, increased regulation, and stricter controls on fossil fuels, which would dramatically raise energy and utility costs.” “Clinton also supports existing trade policies that have contributed to persistent trade deficits and slower economic growth,” the economists write. They claim that Trump’s reforms in trade, regulation, and energy could generate $2.374 trillion in additional revenue, making the plan both effective and sustainable.

"Hillary Clinton skipped a major fundraiser in North Carolina. Her team claims the event was ""canceled,"" but the real story is that she missed the most essential task for someone trying to stay relevant in politics: raising money. Sure, Hillary Clinton has plenty of questionable Haitian funds, but compared to Trump, she’s still “financially struggling.” Her absence from the event raises questions, and the campaign offered no explanation—just like they never explain her lack of public appearances. The fundraiser was set to take place in Raleigh, with top Democratic donors expecting to pay handsomely for a chance to meet her. According to ABC News, the event was hosted at the home of Susan and James Holloway. It was promoted as “Dinner with Hillary Clinton,” with ticket prices ranging from $3,000 to $125,000. If you saw her on *The Tonight Show* last week, that was taped weeks ago, just days after her doctor declared her “physically fit to lead.” Still, there’s no word on her campaign plans for this week.

"A reportedly disabled, African American man experiencing a medical episode was shot by police on Monday afternoon. The incident occurred shortly after his family called 911 for emergency medical help. Police in Fontana, California — near Los Angeles — tweeted that officers encountered a ""disturbed individual"" that resulted in an officer-involved shooting. The victim, later identified as Marcus Johnson, was reportedly having a seizure when officers arrived. Local activist and Black Lives Matter supporter Jamal Carter shared on social media that Johnson succumbed to his injuries. Officers responded to a disturbed individual that ended in a shooting. More updates will follow as they become available — Fontana Police (@fontanapd) October 5, 2016  

A colleague at the scene mentioned there was a fatal police shooting in the area. The name is Marcus Johnson. I’m close to someone who was there. — Jamal Carter (@jamalblacklife) October 6, 2016  

During a live stream on Facebook, journalist Tasha Nguyen spoke with Johnson’s mother, who said her son was 28 years old. She claimed he was having a seizure and had called for medical aid. Moments after police arrived, Johnson was shot. “I just wanted help, not for them to kill him,” she cried, overwhelmed with grief. “Oh my God, you killed my son!” “I should have reached out to the mental health crisis team,” she added.  

In a Periscope video from the scene filmed by KTLA reporter Daniel Kim, at least two witnesses said Johnson was shot while his hands were raised. “I saw a black man surrounded by officers with guns drawn, which really caught my attention,” one witness said, mimicking the position of his hands. “The man had his hands like this, terrified, not sure what to do… as soon as he moved in that direction, they fired. Bang, bang, bang, five shots straight into him.” Watch on #Periscope: Untitled https://t.co/4nXqWzYpR2 — Daniel Kim (@danielktla) October 5, 2016  

According to KTLA, police took cell phones from staff at a nearby diner and told them not to speak to anyone. The ACLU of Los Angeles released a statement criticizing the phone seizures. “Taking people’s phones without a warrant or legal justification violates both the Fourth and First Amendments,” said ACLU attorney",1
"We’ve all seen political promises that backfire. One of the most infamous was “read my lips…no new taxes,” which helped George H.W. Bush win an election but ultimately contributed to his defeat after he imposed one of the largest tax hikes in history. Now, Donald Trump has made a statement in response to the recent attacks in New York and Minnesota that could rival that moment—perhaps even exceed it.

Take a look at that and think about what it implies. While the personal jabs at President Obama and Secretary Clinton are notable, Trump’s main focus was on eliminating the ""existential threat"" of terrorism. He didn’t propose increasing counterterrorism budgets or addressing online radicalization—he promised to ""destroy"" terrorists and end terrorism on American soil.  

Imagine if he actually tried to carry out this plan. The word “destroy” is pretty clear. While his supporters might cheer this rhetoric, the reality is far more disturbing. He’s hinting at targeting Muslims specifically, suggesting something akin to a harsher version of the Patriot Act, where people of certain ethnic backgrounds could be treated as suspects without evidence.  

For instance, the individual being investigated by the FBI isn’t just a Muslim—he’s an American citizen who deserves due process. Just because someone is a suspect doesn’t mean they’re guilty. Under Trump’s approach, that person could be labeled as a threat without any real legal justification. There’s no indication that citizenship, rights, or fair treatment would matter.  

This could lead to heavy surveillance in Muslim communities, like those in Dearborn or Queens, with residents being stopped and detained without cause. If there's no way to tell Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they be forced to wear identifiers? If you think I'm overreacting and don’t see the danger in this rhetoric, reread the statement. It's not about strategy or solutions—it's about wiping out terrorism by any means necessary.  

It might sound appealing to some who thrive on fear and prejudice, but to those who understand history, it's deeply unsettling. Trump is once again using fear-mongering to appeal to the least informed. Like many of his campaign promises, this is likely another empty slogan—",1
"In a disturbing escalation of Islamophobic violence seen increasingly across the United States, a man in northeast Philadelphia (near 3rd and Berks streets) is now under investigation for launching a firebomb into a parked vehicle. Witnesses reported the suspect shouting “there you go, Muslim!” as he threw what appears to be an improvised incendiary device at the car. The driver suffered serious burns and was taken to the hospital for treatment. This attack comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes, with reports showing a dramatic 87.5% increase following Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's controversial call for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Such acts of violence not only deepen divisions but also reinforce harmful stereotypes that Muslims are unwelcome in America, creating an environment where extremist ideologies can thrive. Extremist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda have long argued that Western societies harbor deep hostility toward Islam, and incidents like this only fuel their recruitment efforts. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden has warned that rhetoric promoting fear and exclusion can dangerously align with the narratives of radical groups, potentially pushing individuals toward extremism. He stated, “When leaders say things like ‘they all hate us,’ it plays directly into the hands of those who seek to divide us.” To prevent the spread of terrorism and hatred, we must embrace inclusivity and uphold the values of diversity and respect that define our nation. Authorities are still looking for the suspect. Here’s a video of the scene, shared by @FeministaJones:",1
"If an October surprise doesn’t stop Hillary, the forgotten can. The forgotten and their families can bring her down. Anti-Hillary sentiment could be widespread, not just limited to Trump voters. Here’s the list of the forgotten: 1. Auto workers. 2. Oil rig employees. 3. Midwestern farmers. 4. People who lost jobs due to trade policies, rising taxes, and minimum wage hikes. 5. Individuals who feel unsafe without access to firearms. 6. Young adults burdened with student debt but struggling to find stable work. 7. Families affected by crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. 8. Residents of Flint and other areas with polluted water due to government neglect. 9. Parents frustrated by declining school quality under No Child Left Behind and Common Core. 10. Citizens across faiths who oppose the spread of Sharia law. 11. People who support family planning but are against abortion. 12. Former offenders who believe they’ve been treated unfairly compared to Hillary. 13.

"Scroll down for video It's hard to deny that this election cycle has been marked by extreme divisiveness, with topics like immigration, national security, and the economy fueling a growing sense of distrust in American society. The institutions we once believed in have suffered from years of corruption, self-interest, and unethical behavior by those who were supposed to protect them. While some critics focus on discrediting Trump, they often ignore the fact that the political elite—those in power—are largely responsible for the country’s decline. Alongside the current occupant of the White House, there's another figure who has spent decades in politics, yet now claims to be an outsider—Hillary Clinton. Despite her long career, she and Bill Clinton have built a massive financial empire, raising serious questions about their true motives. A 3-minute video highlights how the ""Clinton Foundation"" operates as more than just a charitable organization; it's alleged to function as a financial pipeline for the couple, using their influence to secure donations from foreign governments and wealthy individuals. As Secretary of State, Hillary was accused of trading access for money, while Bill capitalized on her position to collect large speaking fees from countries that had donated to the foundation. Is it fair to question Hillary's qualifications given her history of controversy and scandal? Share this post with your friends and leave your thoughts in the comments below.",1
"The House Oversight Committee has directed the social media platform Reddit to retain copies of posts allegedly created by a computer specialist linked to the effort to obscure Hillary Clinton’s email correspondence. (If you are not familiar with the story, read this first) Chairman of the Oversight Committee, Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, stated to The Hill that the request “has legal weight, and you can’t erase information and expect it to disappear.” The posts in question seem to have been authored by Paul Combetta, a technician at Platte River Networks, a Colorado-based IT firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private email server. These posts were removed on Monday, shortly after they were uncovered by online investigators and shared widely across the internet. In the posts, an account under the name “stonetear” sought advice on how to “remove” email addresses from a “high-profile individual’s” messages. “They don’t want the VIP’s email exposed, and they want to either remove or replace the email address in the to/from fields of all outgoing emails,” one post reads, dated July 24, 2014 — a key date in the Clinton email controversy. The day before, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had finalized an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton’s work-related emails. The FBI’s report on its investigation of Clinton’s emails noted that during that same month, Combetta transferred email backups to two of her lawyers, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. The Reddit post raises questions about potential attempts to conceal information. If “stonetear” is indeed Combetta, as many believe, this would not be the first instance of his involvement in a possible cover-up. Combetta was the technician who used BleachBit to delete backup files of Clinton’s emails in March 2015, weeks after the media exposed her email setup and after Congress had issued subpoenas for her records. He also provided false information to the FBI during an initial interview about his use of the software. Despite this, the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email probe. Last week, Combetta and another Platte River Networks employee, Bill Thornton, declined to appear before the House Oversight Committee, invoking their Fifth Amendment rights. “The allegations that Combetta raised about Clinton’s server on Reddit fit a pattern we’ve seen,” Chaffetz told The Hill. Another Oversight Committee member, North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, acknowledged that",1
"It’s a moment of triumph for ISIS and Caliphate loyalists across the globe as they enthusiastically share and celebrate the alleged terrorist blast that rocked a major city and the knife attack carried out by an ISIS-linked individual in a Chicago shopping center. Following the explosion, social media was flooded with messages from jihadist sympathizers expressing pride over what they see as a victory for their cause. Some of the posts included; “The lions of the Caliphate strike again in the heart of the enemy,” wrote a user named “Sword of Allah” on Twitter, who was quickly banned. Another account, “Shadow of the Crescent,” posted under the Arabic hashtag #BombChicago “O Allah, punish America for its arrogance and bring justice to the oppressed.” Others shared messages like “Another blessing from the Caliphate,” while a user linked to al-Qaeda in Yemen tweeted: “O Allah, destroy the infidels, count them and eliminate them one by one, leaving no trace behind.”  
This dark force thrives on violence and suffering. Its name is radical Islamic extremism. It revels in the death of innocent people and finds joy in chaos. It mocks the West, Americans, Jews, and Christians, showing no mercy or compassion. It seeks the day when Islam rules the world. This evil spreads online, boasting about bloodshed and celebrating every act of terror. And this latest incident is just another proof of its growing influence. There is celebration among extremists as citizens of Chicago and Illinois mourn. It must be stopped. But who will stand against it? Watch the video of the attack below.",1
"If you're a fan of the Eagles, I hope you prioritize your country and freedom over racial politics. Personally, I’m considering boycotting them and even the whole NFL, despite there being some decent players. Four Philadelphia Eagles players raised the Black Power fist during the National Anthem at their game. I'm really fed up with this nonsense. I've seen similar actions from other players too. In fact, I've even seen the Obamas do something similar. This is completely unacceptable—it's a radical, racist act and shouldn’t be allowed. It’s no different than a Nazi salute. Did you know that Sports Illustrated has fully endorsed the Black Lives Matter movement, running a full-page article on Jacksonville Jaguars player Jared Odrick? That’s another one to cross off.  

From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama-era reality. Last week, NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now, they’re raising the Black Power fist. On Monday, four Eagles players did just that during the National Anthem. Malcolm Jenkins and several teammates held their fists high during the national anthem. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/lLW8ZoYUUn — John Clark CSN (@JClarkCSN) September 20, 2016  

This happened just days after a black man attacked a police officer in Philadelphia, shooting her eight times in the arm. The only reason she survived was her bulletproof vest. He then shot a security guard and took a human hostage. He wounded a woman in the leg and fired 14 rounds into a car with two people inside, killing one and seriously injuring the other. He later shot another officer who ended up killing him. These football players are promoting racial division at an Eagles game, essentially celebrating that kind of violence. They’re wealthy anti-American activists, and I think fans have had enough. We love America, our military, and our police. This country was moving toward being colorblind until Obama came along. Now we're divided and heading toward a race war. These privileged, whiny football players, who’ve been free to play and make millions, hate the country and the fans who gave them everything. I say take away their privilege. No game is worth supporting racism and hatred like this.

"One of the most prominent progressive voices in American politics is Senator Elizabeth Warren. She has long been associated with Senator Bernie Sanders, sharing similar policy views and campaign strategies. However, she remains controversial due to her repeated claims of Native American heritage, which many believe were used to secure scholarships and professional opportunities under affirmative action programs. Conservatives have consistently criticized her for this, and with good reason. A student recently confronted her at a public event, capturing the exchange on video. The young man challenged her about her ethnicity, and Warren reportedly became visibly flustered, quickly leaving the scene. It was as if she had been caught in a lie. Watch here. The incident took place during a campaign event at Ohio State University where Warren was supporting Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland in his bid for Hillary Clinton's support. The two leaders urged voters to back Clinton and work toward a Democratic majority in the Senate. When the student questioned Warren about her past claims, she initially denied the accusations. But the student wasn’t finished. He insisted that she had lied about her heritage to gain access to minority-based financial aid. Warren’s reaction was swift and awkward, as if she couldn’t escape the truth fast enough. As the old saying goes, if you want to anger a conservative, lie to them—but if you want to hurt a liberal, tell them the truth. Donald Trump faced backlash for calling her ""Pocahontas,"" a mocking reference to her racial claims. Yet, the truth has a way of catching up with those who try to hide it. In this case, the accusations are not baseless—they’re real. Warren may run, but she can’t outrun the consequences of her actions.",1
"Police were called to a New Jersey middle school after a 12-year-old student said, ""Cupcakes,"" while discussing lunch, his father claimed. Another student reportedly took the comment as a racial slur, according to the New York Daily News. A staff member then contacted law enforcement. “He was just talking about snacks,” said the boy’s father, Michael Thompson. “Who did he offend?” Thompson expressed concern about the school's handling of the situation. “I don’t feel safe sending my son back this fall. The staff doesn’t seem to understand what’s going on.” He added that his son felt scared when a police officer approached him with a visible weapon and asked, “What exactly did you say?” No one stood by the child during the conversation. Authorities also spoke with other parents, and the case was forwarded to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Collingswood Police Chief Kevin Carey mentioned in a meeting with school leaders that they should involve police in even minor incidents, including things like name-calling or slang that might be misinterpreted. Officers were instructed to report nearly all cases to Child Protection. This marked a change from the previous Memorandum of Agreement, which limited police involvement to serious issues like drugs or assault. Since the policy shift, officers have been called to the school up to four times a day. “A lot of it is just kids being kids,” said teacher Laura Martinez. “I’ve never felt so unsure about how to handle a situation before.” The mayor, local police, and the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office held a meeting to address the growing concerns. “In our discussion today, you made it clear that the recent meeting was meant to reaffirm the Memorandum of Agreement, not to broaden its scope,” wrote Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley in a letter to the prosecutor’s office, as reported by the Collingswood Patch.

"Washington (CNN) A daughter of Robert Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, revealed in a social media post that former Republican President George H.W. Bush expressed his support for — hold on — Hillary Clinton. Townsend, a Democrat who previously served as Maryland's lieutenant governor and is known online as Hartington, shared a picture with the former president on Facebook: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" she wrote, noting that she is also a niece of President John F. Kennedy. A representative for Bush, Jim McGrath, refused to comment on the claim. ""The former president will cast his vote privately in about 50 days, and that's all we'll say,"" McGrath said to CNN. ""He isn't making any statements about the election until then."" The conversation took place during a board meeting at the family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, for the nonpartisan Points of Light Foundation. Some sources familiar with the exchange told CNN's Jamie Gangel that they were taken aback by Townsend's decision to share a private discussion. For more insights on the 2016 race, check out ""The Daily DC"" podcast. If George H.W. Bush ends up supporting Clinton, it likely won't influence his entire family. His son, Marvin Bush, has stated he plans to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, the president's grandson, has endorsed Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Jeb Bush, who competed against Trump in the primary, has said he won't back either major candidate.",1
"President Obama and Black Lives Matter have repeatedly tried to promote the idea over the past year that only people of color face unjust treatment due to their race. However, a new video circulating online contradicts this claim. A member of Black Lives Matter was caught violently assaulting an innocent and unarmed white man. The footage is deeply disturbing. Last week, two white men were brutally attacked in Riverside, California, after leaving a Starbucks. Local news reported that a protest was taking place to honor Jamal Thompson, an African American man who was killed by police in May of this year. The two men were white and were walking near the protest when the attack happened. When questioned by police, they claimed the assault was racially motivated. After all, if it looks like a duck and acts like a duck, it's not a goose. Assistant District Attorney Laura Martinez stated that the attackers were from out of state and that their actions had no connection to the protest or Jamal’s death, suggesting the attack was racially driven. A $15,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. This nation is becoming more dangerous with these individuals on the loose. Yet, predictably, mainstream liberal media has overlooked the story, and it remains largely unreported. Naturally, it doesn't align with the narrative of systemic racism against African-Americans. It actually paints Black Lives Matter in a bad light. In fact, it makes them appear racist—exactly the accusation they level at white people. It also reveals them as the biggest frauds in history. But then again, liberals are known for their double standards.",1
"In every state, there are laws in place to ensure the integrity and fairness of the electoral process. The Democratic Party, described by some as a ""dangerous radical group,"" has allegedly been working aggressively to manipulate the outcome of elections through any means necessary. [Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Dangerous Radical Group] As a patriotic American and constitutional conservative with a background in political theory, the author believes that this party is determined to push the United States toward a socialist regime, using tactics such as voter fraud, ballot tampering, and other unlawful methods to get “Hillary the Horrible” elected as president in the November 2016 election. A fair and free election should encourage all eligible citizens to participate. However, it is deeply troubling when a political party—particularly one that is accused of trying to undermine the election—promotes voting procedures that could lead to fraudulent activity. The correct approach for any election is to ensure it is both free and just. Only those who are properly registered and legally entitled to vote should be allowed to cast their ballots. This can be achieved by implementing a simple, easily accessible photo ID system that is hard to counterfeit and requires voters to prove they are U.S. citizens and legal residents. The Democratic Party reportedly opposes such measures because they want individuals who may not be eligible, registered, or even truthful about their identity to vote, thereby helping to secure an unfair victory for Hillary the Horrible. Due to the failure of the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our corrupt Congress, and our biased federal judiciary to pass laws that guarantee honest elections, the only option left for the American people is to mobilize in large numbers to observe polling stations and prevent voter fraud as much as possible. Donald Trump, despite his imperfections, has clearly stated his stance, including a powerful and principled speech at a rally on Friday, September 23, where he expressed his deep love for the country and his goal to protect it from collapse. The Democratic Party, America’s most dangerous radical group, not only seeks to elect “Hillary the Horrible” and turn the U.S. into a despotic regime, but also intends to steal the election if given the chance. Let us recognize that November 8, 2016, may be the final opportunity to stop or at least delay the downfall of our 240-year-old republic. Given the alleged hatred for everything good that the Democratic Party represents, citizens across the nation",1
"The thought of having to keep covering the Obamas for the next four years is really starting to bother me. I thought I was done with them after the early days of Obama’s presidency, but it seems like Hillary Clinton has a few positions lined up for both the President and First Lady once she takes office. What will Michelle Obama be known for? Is it her push for kids to eat like starving rabbits, or the failed school lunch program that got debunked by experts? Or maybe it's that infamous line about being proud of her country for the first time? Personally, I’ll remember her for her strong social media presence and the “#BringBackOurGirls” campaign. But why focus on her when one of the presidential candidates is already planning to bring her into her team? *insert sarcastic applause here*. What exactly would her role be? What qualifications does she even have? It's not hard to guess what Hillary wants her to do—after all, Clinton has always believed the government should take a big role in raising YOUR children. If you don’t believe me, check out this tweet:  
How can you shape people’s thinking if they’re allowed to teach their own kids? To make things worse, Hillary keeps talking about her “faith” and how it led her to her liberal views. Of course, Michelle Obama has already said she has no intention of backing off her efforts to change how we raise our kids, according to The Washington Post. Back in February, she told a health summit that she’s committed to her healthy living initiative for children for the rest of her life. “I don’t have a one- or two-year plan,” she said. “I have a lifelong plan.” This feels desperate. Is Hillary trying to win over people who don’t like her but still like the Obamas? Or does she think having a woman of color in a leadership role will make it harder for people to criticize the government’s influence on education, because, you know, racism? Either way, I’m really uneasy about the idea of progressives taking control of how our children are taught. The government isn’t a parent, and it shouldn’t act like one. That’s a dangerously wrong idea, and history shows that total government control over citizens never ends well.",1
"It's official. Trump's supporters will continue to back Donald Trump regardless of his actions or the truth that comes to light, even if his financial records expose a web of questionable deals. During his late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel once again aired a ""Lie Witness News"" segment, this time targeting Trump supporters with questions based on a fabricated story about him secretly working with Russian officials, using his wife's name for real estate deals, and donating to a charity linked to a convicted sex offender. The reporter approached several Trump fans and asked their opinion on these claims. Unsurprisingly, every supporter insisted they would still vote for the Republican candidate, no matter how damaging the revelations might be. In fact, many tried to downplay the accusations, claiming Trump was just being ""strategic"" or ""business-like."" When Trump famously said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any support, he wasn't exaggerating. His followers remained unmoved by the allegations, even when told he listed his job as a farmer on his tax returns. Here's the clip from YouTube. Trump's base is clearly willing to overlook any scandal or ethical violation. It doesn’t matter what he says, what he does, or how much he undermines American values — his supporters will stick by him. The question now is: will the rest of us remain passive on Election Day, allowing extremists to take control? Or will we finally take action and ensure that someone like Trump never holds office? If his followers are okay with his behavior, it means he could act with total impunity in the White House — a dangerous prospect for the country.",1

"What’s the real purpose of the FBI? I understand what they claim to do, but honestly, what are they really for?

I hope they feel guilty about their inaction, and I also hope they’re forced to cover the medical costs of the victims, along with all the pain, suffering, and lost income.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man accused of planting and detonating hidden IEDs in New York and New Jersey, was eventually arrested by police. It later came out that his father had reported him to the FBI in 2014, claiming he was a terrorist, according to The New York Times. Two years before Rahami carried out his bombing attacks, his father told New Jersey authorities that his son was a terrorist. This information was shared with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in Newark. An initial investigation was launched, including interviews with the father, who later retracted his statement.  

It appears the father may have made the accusation out of frustration, but there’s a strong sense that he knew more than he let on. Should the father also be held responsible for not following through on what he claimed, putting innocent people in danger? Or is the blame solely on the son, who actually built and set off the bombs? In my view, there’s plenty of fault to go around. The terrorist himself is obviously the main culprit, but I also think the FBI and the father share some responsibility for not acting on what was known.",1

Word is that Black Lives Matter groups were trying to bring in crowds here too. In our area, things stayed calm, thank goodness. But it was much worse in Raleigh. The head of the local police union openly stated that these were organized criminals who were flown in. This is how the radical left has been orchestrating these protests from the start. They wait for a trigger event, then use the black community as pawns for their agenda. Bring in outside agitators and then incite violence.

Let’s hear it from CNN… “This isn’t Raleigh that’s out there. These are outsiders causing the trouble. These aren’t protesters, they’re troublemakers.” “We’ve got the instigators coming in from outside the state. They arrived on buses from other areas. If you look at the arrests from last night, probably 65% had out-of-state IDs. They didn’t come from Raleigh.” I think it didn’t escalate here in Oklahoma City because the local population isn’t as supportive of Black Lives Matter. Plus, the officer who shot the black man has now been charged with second-degree murder. I still think she had a valid reason, but the charge likely cooled things down. Raleigh has a strong Black Lives Matter presence, and with previous incidents there, it was already set up for a riot. It’s no longer a conservative area and plays into their political goals. These groups don’t care about the facts or the lives being lost. They’re just looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their endgame… part of a larger plan to tear America apart. That’s what the far left wants — revolution, race conflict, and total disruption.",1
"Student groups at Western State University were reportedly pressured to alter the theme of a “Patriotic Picnic” after the administration labeled it as “too controversial.” The event was planned to be co-hosted by the College Republicans and three campus residence halls, but one hall administrator claimed that promotional materials featuring a red, white, and blue flag were considered “too political and biased.” Students at Western State University recently faced pressure to change the theme of a “Patriotic Picnic” due to concerns from the administration. According to internal communications obtained by Campus Pulse, Lisa Chen, the Assistant Residence Director of Pine Hall, sent an email on August 12 to the College Republicans and the Young Democrats inviting them to collaborate on a patriotic-themed barbecue with Pine and Jefferson Halls. The proposal included setting up booths for student organizations and promoting civic engagement, with CR Vice President Jordan Lee quickly agreeing to participate. However, on September 13, just a day before the event, Chen contacted Lee, explaining that Pine Hall would no longer support the collaboration due to the “sensitive nature” of the theme. She later stated the event would still take place, but with a revised focus. Read the full story at Campus Pulse.

"George H.W. Bush is now 93 years old. Do you remember him? He was the 41st President of the United States and delivered a controversial speech during the 1991 State of the Union in which he declared: “What is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace and security, freedom and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children’s future.” Calling the U.S. a ‘small country’ was offensive enough, but suggesting that America should be used as a tool to advance global goals is even more alarming. The concept of ‘universal aspirations’ is vague at best, especially when trying to unite people from completely different cultures. I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but the term ‘New World Order’ was popularized by our 41st President, so it's worth keeping that in mind.  

It was reported that George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara wanted to keep quiet about their preferences in the upcoming presidential race. However, a political figure with ties to the late Robert F. Kennedy's family sought to find out who Bush supported. She approached him and then shared a photo with him on social media, captioning it with his alleged choice.  

“The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!” she posted. In a phone call, she claimed to have met with the former president in New Hampshire, where he reportedly expressed his support for a Democratic candidate. “That’s what he said,” she told *The New York Times*. When asked about the post, Bush’s spokesperson, Jim McGrath, responded via email: “President Bush will cast his vote as a private citizen in about 50 days, and that will be it. He has no comment on the election until then.”  

So, my question to you is: Does it surprise you that the man who once called the U.S. small and promoted a ‘New World Order’ might be backing Hillary Clinton? They share similar views. While in office, Bush Sr. allowed several U.N. initiatives to pass without much debate. He also supported the introduction of the Common Core curriculum, an element of Agenda 21, into American schools in the 1990s. Hillary Clinton also sees the U.S. as part of a larger global",1
"On Thursday, I reported that among those arrested in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 65% of the individuals involved in violence and looting were from other states. However, a recent article questions why these out-of-state participants aren’t being charged with federal offenses related to crossing state lines to engage in rioting. John McAllister, a contributor at The Conservative Chronicle, argues that the Department of Justice has shown a “lack of commitment” to enforcing laws that prevent outsiders from inciting unrest. He claims that the DOJ’s failure to act on these cases reflects a broader pattern of “non-enforcement” that has worsened over the past decade. McAllister points out that the presence of out-of-state agitators should be a red flag for federal authorities, yet no meaningful action is taken. Instead, he suggests the Justice Department has become indifferent to its duty. He writes: ""Individuals posing as protesters cross state lines to spread chaos and destruction. Has anyone questioned whether the law against interstate rioting is being enforced?"" According to the U.S. Code, Section 2101 outlines penalties for those who travel across state lines with the intent to incite or participate in a riot. It states that anyone who uses interstate commerce—such as phones, emails, or social media—to organize or promote rioting can face fines or imprisonment. There is a clear rationale behind such legislation, as it aims to prevent local conflicts from escalating into nationwide crises when outsiders fuel the violence. Yet, these laws are not being upheld. In 2020, similar concerns were raised about groups like the Black Bloc and other external activists who flooded the streets of Minneapolis, but federal authorities did little to enforce the law. The same statute also prohibits inciting rebellion against the U.S. government, stating that those who aid or encourage insurrection can be imprisoned for up to ten years. McAllister notes that this isn’t the first time he’s raised the issue. In 2016, he wrote about how federal officials ignored similar violations during protests in Baltimore. He concluded, “There’s a clear divide. The administration favors certain groups, while the DOJ turns a blind eye.” This selective enforcement of the law raises serious concerns. Not only does it target innocent citizens, but it also lets lawbreakers go unpunished. Perhaps it's time for the public to hold their leaders accountable and demand real justice.

"Obama claims he's engaged in a “battle for hearts and minds” against ISIS. But when the enemy beheads your soldiers, you’ve not only lost the story—you’ve lost the war. What kind of delusional thinking does Obama think he’s pushing on the American public? Islamic extremists are mass-murdering thousands, turning ""moderate"" Muslims into fanatics, and they're gaining ground across the globe to impose Sharia law on everyone. Obama frames this as a conflict between those who “misuse” a religion of peace and those who truly believe in its peaceful nature. This is the new reality of peace under Obama’s leadership. America can expect Democrats to continue bringing in low-cost labor from Mexico and South America, while also welcoming Muslim refugees from the Middle East as part of Obama’s so-called “New Jihad.” In atonement for killing Osama bin Laden, Obama has supported the Muslim Brotherhood by supplying weapons, funding, and airpower to topple governments in the region. As he helps resurrect the Caliphate, Obama is wasting American resources by financing terrorism through Iran, while simultaneously inviting our enemies into our country to make America pay for resisting Islam. Hillary Clinton has already vowed to follow Obama’s path. She plans to grant foreigners full citizenship and rights that could override American interests, as they push for Sharia law to take hold over us non-believers. If voters choose a Republican Congress that might stop her, she’ll use executive power and a sympathetic Supreme Court to enforce her agenda, just as Obama has done. Who are the fools who think Hillary would be a better counter-terrorist than Trump? This isn’t about which version of Islam is better or more authentic—1,400 years of history and Muhammad’s own words show that the Islamic State is fundamentally Islamic. It’s Obama’s naive belief that Islam is a religion of peace that’s the real delusion. Helping Islam dominate the world won’t improve things—it will turn the world into the nightmare that the Muslim Middle East has become. Obama’s Wars – creating chaos, not peace.

"Black Lives Matter unveiled their policy agenda last month that includes cutting funding for law enforcement, implementing race-specific reparations, granting voting rights to undocumented immigrants, pushing for divestment from fossil fuels, ending private and charter schools, establishing a “universal basic income,” and offering free higher education for Black Americans. According to this platform, it seems that Black people are somehow incapable of self-sufficiency or family support. It’s no surprise, then, that the national BLM organization criticized an unofficial chapter for organizing a community event that included a barbecue with local police officers. The group quickly distanced itself from the gathering, issuing a statement: “THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL #BLACKLIVESMATTER CHAPTER! THIS IS NOT IN LINE WITH OUR VALUES.” @Blklivesmatter https://t.co/IIlnTbgE1S — BlackLivesMatter DC (@DMVBlackLives) July 20, 2016  

The goal of Black Lives Matter isn’t to unite communities but to incite division. Their response to the event revealed a clear intent to destabilize the nation by deepening racial tensions—something that aligns with the interests of their major backer, George Soros. Soros has a history of funding movements that create social unrest for financial gain. He has funneled at least $33 million to Black Lives Matter through his Open Society Foundations and the Center for American Progress. Unlike Occupy Wall Street, which failed to generate real change due to a lack of unity and purpose, Black Lives Matter has tapped into a powerful emotional current within the Black community. By blaming systemic issues rather than individual responsibility, they’re fueling a movement that could fracture the social fabric of America.  

In Wichita, Kansas, a local group organized a community event with police to foster dialogue about trust and safety. The Sunflower Community Action group described it as more than just a cookout—it was an opportunity for residents of different backgrounds to engage in meaningful conversation. A report from the Wichita Eagle noted that “At one table, a Black man, a Hispanic man, and a white man sat down with burgers next to Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their thoughts.” BLM later clarified that their initial criticism was aimed at groups misrepresenting their values, stating, “Our message about BLM BBQs with police was a response to the backlash from the event. We remain focused on dismantling the system.”

"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A man taken into custody on Tuesday in relation to the New York City bombing recently filed a lawsuit against his local police department over allegations of anti-Muslim bias. Mohammad Ali Rahman, who was living in Newark, N.J., before he placed explosives in a subway station in Midtown, a parking lot in Jersey City, and near a local marathon event, claimed that officers were targeting him because of his faith, according to reports from The New York Post. Rahman, who worked at a family-owned deli called Brooklyn Bagel, said that police frequently issued “unjustified” citations to his business and that some residents in the area had told him, “Muslims aren’t welcome here.” He filed the legal action alongside his father, Ahmed, and his brother, Omar. He was arrested after a confrontation with law enforcement, during which he was found unconscious near a convenience store in New Jersey.

"Social Security is often referred to as the third rail of American politics: touch it and you’re finished. And if that’s true, then Donald Trump may soon be looking for a new political strategy. According to a report by The New York Times, during a private meeting with Mitch McConnell on April 28, Trump reportedly admitted that he supports reducing Social Security benefits, but he’s hesitant to voice that opinion publicly due to fears of losing voter support in the general election. The report quotes an anonymous attendee who was present during the conversation. The source claims Trump told McConnell, “I believe in Social Security, but I also have to win. A Republican can’t beat a Democrat if they’re the one saying, ‘We’re going to cut your benefits,’ while the Democrat promises more.” This contradicts Trump’s public stance, where he has consistently claimed he will not touch Social Security. Michael Hiltzik, a policy analyst with the Center for American Progress, argues that this aligns with the broader Republican agenda: ""Trump’s real goal is to slash benefits while keeping the appearance of support. He knows the public opposes cuts, so he’s willing to lie about it to get elected."" In his view, the ""moral"" choice for Trump is to take from seniors without telling them. As seen throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump frequently changes his positions and lacks clarity on key issues. He’s not just dishonest—he’s a threat to the integrity of our democracy.

"I can't wait for ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s sycophantic media allies have already drafted the script. If this woman, God forbid, collapsed and died on the sidewalk tomorrow, these loyal cheerleaders — these media prostitutes whose public credibility has, predictably, hit rock bottom — would dutifully repeat the Clinton campaign line and label it a “minor setback” in her “inevitable” path to victory. The American people aren’t fooled. This is a seriously ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” claims. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild flu,” er, “allergies,” I mean “heat stroke,” that is to say “moderate pneumonia” — is clearly the kind that requires a constant personal physician and a mysterious figure who rushes in whenever she has one of her frequent and unexplained “episodes” (or simply freezes up mid-speech with a “mental lapse”). This man has been seen with the Clintons during medical emergencies dating back to 2003 when Hillary had a brain hemorrhage (also hidden) and was holding what some experts believe is a Valium pen. Valium is an IV medication used to treat seizures. The tinted glasses Mrs. Clinton wore during her recent collapse are also worn by people who suffer from epilepsy. These same glasses are also used to ease symptoms of Parkinson’s disease — a neurological condition many doctors suggest Mrs. Clinton may be suffering from (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological exam?). The Clinton team needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll hear the next time she has a seizure and collapses into the arms of calm Secret Service agents who seem to have seen this before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s back pain is just acting up from the 25 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday.” The point is, once again, by covering up her illness, Mrs. Clinton has reinforced concerns about both her physical and moral readiness to lead. She’s shown, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed many of the doubts voters, as reflected in her historically low approval numbers, have about her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own political ambitions and hunger for",1

The Leader, Donald Trump: Bold leader, powerful presence, determined spirit, and fearless. He has always stood with us and we are fortunate he's here. He understands the underhanded tactics of the elite-businessmen, inside and out. No businessman can control him. When the movement began, he stepped up and took on the challenge. He rolled up his sleeves and is ready to lead. Can he deliver what we want? The more we back him, the stronger he becomes. Let me say this to you, Mr. and Mrs. elite-businessmen of the United States. You're lucky to have elections, a peaceful way to change, or we would have made you pay for your actions. Now America, will you stand behind Trump? This isn't just about the Republican nomination. To the elite-businessmen, will you accept our negotiator in a fair way, or do you prefer to face us directly? Why Trump? First, he's the only one who addresses the real issues and offers clear solutions. The others avoid them, following the rules of the elite-businessmen to stay in power. Beyond his personality, he's an insider. He knows the players in that world of elite-businessmen. He sees what's happening and where the problems lie. A strong leader and manager: In this broken system, we need someone who can take charge and restructure things. Someone who can assign responsibilities and create a new working system.

"Dolly Kyle has penned a controversial ""confession"" book revealing the disturbing secrets behind Bill and Hillary Clinton's rise to power. It details Hillary's ruthless treatment of anyone who stood in her way or didn't meet her high standards. When will the press finally expose this manipulative figure for what she really is? Dolly Kyle, who was just 12 when she first met Bill, dated him through high school, and started an intimate relationship after graduation, claims in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books, that the Clinton couple used racist language and played political games. She recounts an incident at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the governor’s mansion grounds during Bill’s time as Arkansas governor, where developmentally disabled children struggled to collect eggs. Frustrated, Hillary reportedly said, “When are those f*****g retards going to leave?” Dolly writes. Upon arriving in Arkansas, Hillary looked down on the locals, whom she called “ignorant hillbillies.” Raised in a middle-class neighborhood in Illinois, she saw herself as superior to the southerners—except when campaigning in New York, where she claimed to be a lifelong Mets fan. Hillary didn’t fit in Arkansas, but she stayed for eight years. During that time, both Bill and Hillary grew weary of the state’s limitations, and Bill decided not to run for re-election in 1990, using the time to plan his next move toward the presidency.

"The controversies surrounding the Clinton Foundation keep growing. We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings while serving as secretary of state—specifically 85 out of 154 individuals—were with people who either contributed to her personal fund or pledged support for one of the foundation’s global initiatives. We also know the Clinton Foundation received money from questionable foreign organizations. Additionally, nearly half of the employees funded through the GSA program also had ties to the Clinton Foundation. We’re aware that Hillary’s former top aide at the State Department, Cheryl Mills, was simultaneously working for the Clinton Foundation. We know that in 2013, the foundation allocated 10 percent of its budget to charitable grants. While the foundation claims that “88% of our spending goes directly to our life-changing work,” it's hard to see how $8.5 million—used for travel, including flights and hotels—actually helps people. Even more puzzling is that $4.8 million, or 5.6 percent of the 2013 budget, went to office supplies. Paper and pens are expensive, I guess. Call it administrative costs if you want, but it's ridiculous. Dig deeper, and you’ll find even more concerning details. If you thought things couldn’t get worse, think again. In 2014, only 5.7% of the foundation’s budget was directed toward actual charitable work. The rest paid for staff salaries, travel, and other expenses. According to IRS filings, the organization spent nearly $91.3 million that year, with just $5.2 million going to charity. About $34.8 million covered employee pay and benefits, and $50.4 million was listed as ""other expenses."" Oh, and $851,000 was spent on professional fundraising. Fundraising isn’t cheap. Hillary understands that well. The Clintons are incredibly generous, donating over $1 million to charity last year! Who cares if part of that went into their private fund? They're so kind-hearted. Just kidding. Even Vice President Joe Biden has refused to call the Clinton Foundation ethical. h/t Daily Caller",1
"Another day, another coded message from Donald Trump that veils racial bias under the guise of concern. As tensions flare in a major city, Trump—attempting to project authority—shifted blame for the unrest to drug use, offering no evidence to support his claim. During a speech in Cleveland, he stated, “You might not know, but drugs are a huge part of what’s going on right now.” While Trump claims to be informed, the reality is that the unrest stems from long-standing racial inequalities and the tragic deaths of unarmed Black individuals at the hands of police. His remarks reinforce harmful stereotypes that paint Black communities as inherently linked to crime and drug use. The truth is that white individuals use and sell drugs at higher rates than Black people, yet they face far less legal consequences. This disparity is well-documented: studies show that white youth are more likely to engage in hard drug use than their Black counterparts. Instead of perpetuating these myths, Trump should look at the opioid crisis sweeping through rural white communities, where addiction is reaching epidemic levels with little national attention. If he truly wants to address the root causes of unrest, he should focus on real solutions—not just racist rhetoric. The question remains: would his administration do anything meaningful to stop the violence against Black Americans, or would it continue to ignore the facts and amplify division? With the upcoming election, Trump may soon find out how his words are being received by Black voters across the country.",1
"While presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton remain closely matched in national polls, the Republican nominee has consistently outperformed his opponent in terms of crowd size and enthusiasm. On Monday, Trump filled an arena in Naples, Florida, with approximately 7,500 attendees inside and many more gathered outside, even amid a stifling 92-degree temperature, as reported by the Naples Daily News. Meanwhile, just hours later, Clinton’s speech at a community center in Philadelphia drew fewer than 150 people, according to a report from The Philadelphia Inquirer. The event was intended to connect with younger voters, a crucial demographic for Clinton’s campaign, but the turnout fell far short of expectations. Photos from the gathering showed few young people in attendance, and those who did show up appeared disengaged. Conservative commentator Eric Bolling shared a social media post that captured the mood of the Clinton event:

A photo posted by Eric Bolling (@ericbolling) on September 19, 2016 at 10:30 AM EDT  

It was unclear whether the lone young attendee or the empty seats were the most striking aspect of the event. Trump has frequently highlighted the contrast between his energetic rallies and Clinton’s smaller, less enthusiastic crowds. “When Hillary comes in, she doesn’t bring the numbers,” he remarked during a recent appearance. In contrast, Trump’s events have drawn massive crowds across the country, signaling strong support heading into the general election. For example, on September 10, a Trump rally in Daytona Beach attracted over 10,000 people, according to WFTV. The Naples event, with its 7,500 attendees, further underscored the gap between the two campaigns, especially when compared to Clinton’s recent rally in Miami, which drew only around 1,200 people, as noted by the Miami Herald.

"Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean the person who wrote this had it in for Obama? What if that person is… Obama? Fox News reported this, taken from a local news source, titled “Kenyan-born Obama eyeing Illinois Senate seat” That was May 2004. Kenyan-born U.S. Senate candidate, Barack Obama, was looking good to win the Illinois Senate seat after his main opponent, Tom Hagan, withdrew on Thursday due to scandalous allegations involving a strip club. The accusations shocked fellow Republicans and caused Hagan’s campaign to collapse in just a few days, giving Obama a strong advantage as the party searched for a replacement. To our knowledge, Barack Obama never denied this story. It's still available online. Here's a screenshot: Here's the lower part of the same article with the source attribution. And the link to the original. This isn’t as strange as an older one from 1992. That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote: Fox News obtained a promotional brochure from 1992, published by Barack Obama’s literary agent at the time, Acton & Dystel, which claimed Obama was “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The brochure, given out to publishing contacts, included Obama’s bio among 89 other authors represented by the agency. It also promoted his upcoming book, Journeys in Black and White—later abandoned in favor of Dreams from My Father. If Obama is contradicting himself, the real question is, which lie should we consider as him cynically playing the public for personal gain? If his birth in the U.S. is true — as we’re told? Why fabricate it? Unless using the ‘foreigner’ angle gave him unfair advantages or lower tuition. In which case, he’s a deceitful person who took something away from someone more deserving. Maybe a Harvard education. Because if that wasn’t a lie… then something else must be. That something being his American birth and citizenship. Which are required for his presidency.

"Really? Hillary Clinton is now claiming to fight racism, and she's starting with our police officers? This woman is clueless. I'm speechless at how absurd this is…because it's just plain ridiculous! She's making all the wrong moves, trying desperately to gain support. The so-called 'racism' problem doesn't start with police or white people… This lady has completely lost it. “We need to address the systemic racism, this terrible shooting again, how many more times will we see this in our country?” she said during an interview on the Steve Harvey show. Clinton was talking about the police killing of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, insisting he had his “hands up” when he was shot. “This is unbearable and must be unacceptable,” she said. Clinton told Harvey that if the African-American community voted for her, she would work to prevent racial shootings by police. “Maybe I can speak directly to white people and say, ‘This isn’t who we are,’” she added. “We need to fix policing, tackle implicit bias. Actually Hillary…what we need is to stop electing divisive, self-serving, corrupt people into the White House…who stir up chaos just to act like heroes when they spout nonsense like this. She wants this chaos, Obama wanted this chaos. It’s a recipe for ‘stupidity,’ and they want the American people to stay ignorant so they can keep control.”",1
"The attacks are here, and they aren’t going away. They’ve been around for years, and they’re only getting more brazen. It’s entirely possible to reduce them to a minimal threat on our soil, but that would require a leadership willing to defy the global narrative—especially when other world leaders are quick to label us as ‘racists’ or ‘xenophobes’ while we struggle with security. A leadership that admits our current policies aren’t working—they’re actually fueling more violence and endangering American lives. A leadership that rejects the dangerous ideology of Political Correctness, which has blinded us to the real threat. None of this will happen. It can’t. Not until our leaders stop playing political games and start making tough decisions. Every day, media outlets, talk radio, and even Hollywood amplify the same tired debates: Who’s lying this time? What’s the latest scandal from Biden or Trump? And a significant portion of the public is left wondering, “Are these really the best options?” The hope for a new, honest candidate to rise up and fix everything is just wishful thinking. The truth is, we brought this on ourselves. We elect our leaders, and they make choices that affect every community, every state, every citizen. One of those choices is how we confront terrorism. I say terrorism because it’s clear that for years, the main perpetrators have been Islamic extremists. After this weekend’s events, America has been reminded that the battle isn’t over. The war against our values and way of life continues, even if it’s not in the headlines. Senator Ted Cruz has issued a statement called “a realistic plan” for dealing with terrorism: “Recent attacks across the country, from New York to Minnesota, signal a new stage in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, who are now targeting both Europe and the U.S. A year ago, a strong military response in Syria and Iraq could have crippled ISIS, but instead, they've been spreading radicalization in the West, hiding jihadists among refugees and using online platforms to recruit Muslims here. At the same time, groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban are determined to continue their attacks on American soil, just as they did on 9/11. As we face this new reality, we must stop pretending these attacks are isolated events disconnected from the larger war on radical Islam. It's time to stop ignoring the enemy and call them what they are: radical Islamic terrorists waging a coordinated",1
"This week, as Americans were reeling from a series of shocking and brutal attacks across the country by extremist Muslim groups, a growing sense of fear and confusion has been fueled by the Obama administration’s ongoing plan to admit 110,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East this year. Hillary Clinton, currently campaigning for the presidency, has promised to dramatically expand this number, claiming she would bring in over 620,000 Muslim immigrants in her first term if elected. Many citizens are stunned by these proposals, given the lack of reliable screening processes to identify potential terrorists or individuals with criminal records among these newcomers. There is no comprehensive database to assess their backgrounds, nor any mechanism to determine whether they are willing to adopt American values and customs.

Despite the rising threat of Islamic extremism on U.S. soil, both Obama and Clinton remain firmly committed to their immigration policies, which have drawn fierce criticism from state leaders and local officials. In particular, several governors, including Texas’ Greg Abbott, have openly refused to allow further resettlement of Muslim refugees in their states, citing security concerns and past incidents of crime linked to previously resettled immigrants in locations such as Salt Lake City, Detroit, and parts of California. These governors argue that the federal government is overstepping its authority and endangering public safety.

More than two dozen states, led by Texas, have filed lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging what they see as unconstitutional executive actions and violations of state sovereignty. Governor Abbott’s recent refusal to accept additional Muslim immigrants has been seen as a direct challenge to federal power, echoing the principles of the Tenth Amendment and the idea of nullification. This issue has resurfaced in recent years, especially as many Americans feel that the federal government has become increasingly unaccountable and out of touch with the needs of the people.

With the rise of movements like the Tea Party and the growing frustration with Washington, state leaders are increasingly pushing back against what they view as federal overreach. Organizations such as ""Free Nebraska"" and similar groups in other states are advocating for a “convention of states” to address these issues. As tensions mount, it appears that a growing number of governors are preparing to take a stand, potentially leading to a nationwide conflict over states' rights and the balance of power between federal and state governments.

With the upcoming presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. The nation stands at a crossroads, facing not only the threat of radical Islam but also",1
"In his final address to the ineffective United Nations Security Council, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah called on Americans to surrender their freedoms and submit to global governance. In stark contrast to founding father Thomas Jefferson, who once warned, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance,” Obama urged the American people to trade liberty for a false sense of security. “We can only fulfill the mission of this institution by having powerful nations like the United States accept limitations,” Obama stated. He then argued that “nations with great power must relinquish some autonomy in order to achieve lasting peace.” “I believe that in the long run, limiting our freedom of action—while still protecting our national interests—will ultimately make us safer,” he claimed. Naturally, Obama was pushing this agenda to elevate the United Nations, an organization that is anti-American, anti-religious, and fundamentally authoritarian. So, what’s the issue? Is Obama’s word enough to make us comply? Didn’t he also claim that the Affordable Care Act would bring affordable health care to all? That didn’t happen either. This man has consistently misled the public throughout his presidency, and we have the proof. Although Obama, clearly a foreigner according to his own statements, his wife’s claims, a Kenyan ambassador, and the records from the Kenyan Parliament (despite what Trump and others say), insists he speaks for the right cause, he also admits that real Americans, those born here, oppose him. These people are correct. “Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for supporting international norms and multilateral institutions, but I believe in the long run…” Obama said. “We need to back up our words with actions.” Yes, but America is not like other countries. She has always been unique, built on biblical principles, not on the pagan ideas of “international norms.” That’s what made this nation great. “At this moment, we all face a choice,” Obama continued after criticizing the construction of a border wall. “We can choose to move forward with a more cooperative and integrated world or retreat into a divided and conflict-ridden society based on old divisions of nation, tribe, race, and religion. I urge you to move forward, not backward.” While I agree with some level of international cooperation—like trade and diplomacy, as George Washington supported—I disagree with how Obama envisions it. His approach rewards bad behavior and encourages dependency, while redistributing American wealth. This is not only unconstitutional,",1
"As if Donald Trump’s proposal to restrict Muslim immigration wasn’t enough to anger liberals, his broader stance on the “Islamization of America” includes a controversial idea: deporting Muslims who advocate for Sharia law. In an unexpected twist, some individuals attempted to defend Sharia in response. On Twitter, liberal commentator Sarah Stewart wrote, “Donald Trump, many moderate Muslims — those we should support in the battle against extremism — follow Sharia!” The irony is that Stewart is a lesbian, a practice that would be punishable by death under Sharia law. While there's no dispute among Islamic scholars that homosexuality is condemned, the method of punishment remains debated. If this is considered “progressive,” it raises serious concerns about what progressivism truly stands for. Many Americans would also reject the idea of executing apostates or amputating thieves. Now, as reported by Michael Stone, it's becoming clear which legal system many American Muslims favor. Fox News visited the Cedar Riverside neighborhood to ask local Muslims about their views on American law versus Sharia. In the video, every person interviewed stated they prefer Sharia law. “If you’re Muslim, you naturally want Sharia,” they said. They claim it’s acceptable to punish someone for insulting the Prophet Muhammad. They also believe it’s normal to arrange marriages for daughters as young as 15. When asked if they’d rather live in America or Somalia, most said Somalia. The most shocking moment came from a young man who admitted, “I’m not Americanized — I just speak English well and can express myself, but culturally, I’m still Somali.” Watch the full interview at video.foxnews.com Fox News previously covered similar sentiments in May, when it was revealed that at least two Islamic schools in the area teach Sharia law. This aligns with a recent poll by the Center for Security Policy, which found that over half (52%) of U.S. Muslims believe they should have the option of Sharia courts or establish their own tribunals. Only 38% supported American courts for Muslims. America prides itself on tolerance, but that doesn’t mean we should accept the intolerance embedded in Sharia law.",1
"Hillary Clinton made a major gaffe on Wednesday. In a recorded message directed at American workers, the Democratic presidential candidate revealed a side of herself that many have never seen before! It was exactly what one would expect from the so-called ""Queen of Chaos""—loud, unhinged and capable of sending shivers down the spines of even the bravest adults. “‘Why aren’t I leading by 40 points?’ you might wonder,” Hillary shouted with a tone that sounded more like a prison riot than a political speech. “The choice for hardworking families has never been clearer. I need your support to expose Donald Trump’s record to the whole country.” “Don’t be fooled!” she snapped, her voice so piercing that it could have shattered glass—and likely did. Throughout the rest of the video, she maintained that same aggressive energy, focusing not on Trump but on the very people she was trying to win over. As a result, instead of boosting her image, she ended up alienating the very voters she needed. You can watch a short clip below, but be warned—don’t show it to your kids, or they might start fearing a “Hillary monster” under their beds. That is one intense woman!! Does she really think this kind of behavior will help her get elected? Take note of this version of Hillary compared to the polished, composed persona she usually shows in public. At campaign rallies or during interviews, she tries (and fails) to come off as friendly, approachable, and likable. The Hillary in this video is far closer to the one described by her former Secret Service protectors. For instance, former agent Mark Smith once called her “unpredictable, volatile, and prone to outbursts.” This Hillary definitely matches the profile of the cold-hearted, ruthless leader many have accused her of being. Smith also recalled that Hillary often yelled at agents, White House staff, and even her own husband, Bill Clinton. Everyone lived in constant fear of her next emotional explosion. That sounds about right…",1
"An independent examiner has concluded that Jamal Carter, a 14-year-old African-American boy who was fatally shot by police in Detroit, MI last Tuesday, was “more likely than not” fleeing from officers at the time of the shooting. This finding appears to challenge the official police account, which claims that Carter was shot during a confrontation after he ""drew a realistic-looking airsoft gun on officers."" The incident occurred at 8:15 pm last Tuesday following reports of a theft involving a group of three African-American teenagers. According to the police report, ""officers pursued the individuals into an alley and attempted to detain them when one suspect pulled a weapon from his waistband. An officer fired multiple shots, striking the suspect."" While the Detroit medical examiner has completed an autopsy, the results will not be released for at least six weeks. This delay led Carter’s family to hire Dr. Lena Thompson, a forensic pathologist from the University of Illinois and a consultant with the Cook County coroner's office. In a statement released by the family's attorney, Thompson stated, “Based on the trajectory of the wounds, it is more likely than not that Jamal Carter was running away from the officers when he was shot.” Although Carter was involved in the theft, his friend Marcus Johnson, 20, who was present and later arrested, said that Carter “wanted to steal something to buy food.” Thompson’s findings support community concerns that the use of lethal force was unwarranted and that the story of Carter pointing a gun at officers may have been fabricated. Johnson’s earlier account also contradicted the official version, stating, “The cops told us to get down, and we did, but Jamal got up and ran. Then the cop shot him.” It's important to remember that stealing a few dollars doesn't justify taking a life in the U.S. While some may argue that Carter deserved what he got for committing a crime, it's worth noting that when white youths are convicted of serious offenses, like assault or sexual misconduct, they often receive lighter sentences or probation. But when Black youth are involved, they’re frequently labeled as dangerous and met with lethal force. The Carter case is part of a disturbing trend of deadly encounters between young Black men and law enforcement, often involving BB guns or replica weapons. Given how common such weapons are among white Americans, the assumption by police that any object resembling a firearm in the hands of a Black teen is a deadly threat is deeply flawed. The",1
"What would you do if you found yourself trapped in a crowd of furious people blocking your path? You slow down, hoping they’ll step aside, but instead, they push forward, clearly intent on stopping you. Recalling the events of a recent protest, you realize you're faced with a tough choice: accelerate and risk harming someone, or stay still and risk being attacked. From what I've seen, when your life is on the line, self-preservation is the only option. It seems I'm not alone in that belief. An incident recently occurred at a university where protesters had taken over a main road. A lone driver, clearly in a hurry, decided to drive through the crowd, knocking over a few demonstrators. Watch the video below to see what happened.  

Some claim the protest was about a recent shooting, but that's not what this was about. The real issue was the offensive graffiti — including the word ""KKK"" and ""Leave N*****s"" — that had been painted on the school’s wall. The message was quickly removed, and the school issued an apology, but it was too late. The Black Lives Matter group was furious. Let’s be clear: it's better to face legal consequences for hitting a protester than to risk your life or lose your belongings to a group that believes they have the right to take from you based on something someone else said or did. The saying “Better to be judged by 12 than carried by six” isn’t just about protecting your home — it applies to protecting yourself, too. When surrounded by an angry, irrational crowd that wants violence, there’s no good reason to stop. What would you do in that situation? Would you keep going, or would you let them take control?",1
"A journalist from *The Intercept* was detained last week while attempting to obtain a press credential from the Trump campaign. Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized *New York Times* reporter David Plotz on social media for unfavorable coverage — a pattern that has become increasingly common during his presidential bid. He has banned numerous journalists from his events, with some forced to leave his rallies under the protection of Secret Service agents. Trump has also called for relaxing libel laws, which could make it harder for reporters to publish critical stories. He previously filed a lawsuit against websites that reported his wife was linked to a scandal involving a Slovenian escort. On Monday, Trump made a statement about the media that many consider one of his most controversial yet. During an appearance on *Fox & Friends*, he discussed the recent terror attacks in New York and New Jersey. After falsely blaming refugees, the hosts noted that extremist ideas can spread online without needing a physical presence in conflict zones. Trump then shifted his focus to the freedom of the press, claiming, “They’re all talking about it so nicely because it’s called ‘freedom of the press,’ where you buy magazines and they tell you how to build these bombs.” He quickly contradicted himself, saying he supports free speech but also accusing the media of “inciting violence.” “They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people who do that because they’re committing a crime. Instead, they say, ‘Oh no, you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.’” He also suggested that internet content should be more tightly controlled, comparing it to China’s approach: “These websites are the same thing — those people should be arrested. They’re encouraging violence, okay? They’re enabling it. They should be arrested immediately… but we don’t want to touch them because of free speech.” While incitement isn’t protected under the First Amendment, proving intent is difficult. If the standards change, Trump himself could face legal consequences for encouraging violence at his rallies or suggesting that “Second Amendment people” might target opponents. His growing hostility toward the media raises serious concerns. Using these attacks to undermine constitutional rights echoes the fear-driven tactics of the Bush administration, which led to significant erosion of civil liberties. Trump’s actions suggest a clear path toward weakening the First Amendment. Free press and expression are fundamental to democracy; without them, the media becomes a tool of the powerful. Only someone with something to hide would fear the truth. Featured Image via Getty",1
"Conservatives often claim that Islam is a religion of peace and compassion. The truth, however, tells a different story. While they criticize others for being intolerant toward the LGBTQ+ community, they conveniently overlook the deep-seated hostility that exists within certain Muslim communities. The growing influence of Islam in Western nations is revealing the flaws in their perspective. Many liberal leaders have welcomed large numbers of Muslim immigrants into their countries, and the consequences have been severe. Sharia law is slowly gaining traction in parts of Europe, and for those who are not accepted by Islamic teachings, this is deeply unsettling. A troubling example occurred in Manchester, England, when a gay man named Daniel Greene was attacked while walking with his partner, Emily Clarke. According to Clarke, they were approached by a group of men who began hurling homophobic insults. The situation escalated quickly — one of the men pulled out a weapon and struck Greene in the face. Clarke recalled, “He was screaming and crying. It was terrifying.” She added, “Daniel is such a kind-hearted person — he didn’t deserve this.” The attacker was seen recording the incident on his phone. This wasn’t an isolated event. Last week, another attack on a same-sex couple took place in London. Could it be a coincidence that as the Muslim population has grown, so too has the number of hate crimes? The evidence suggests otherwise. From violence against LGBTQ+ individuals to increased rates of sexual assault, Europe is facing a serious crisis. The connection is clear: Sharia law condemns homosexuality and considers it a crime worthy of punishment. Groups like ISIS have carried out brutal executions of gay individuals, including throwing them from buildings. It’s no surprise that as Muslim populations grow, the safety of LGBTQ+ people in Europe is under threat. The question remains: will any liberals finally acknowledge this reality — or continue to ignore the growing danger?",1

"As WikiLeaks reveals, the plan was to name Abedin as Secretary of State. If elected, Hillary Clinton would have appointed Huma Abedin as Secretary of State. This comes from leaked emails between Abedin, Mrs. Clinton, and Clinton’s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. Abedin, 40, would have been the first Muslim to hold the position and one of the youngest ever selected. However, she would not be the first foreign-born Secretary of State—Henry Kissinger, now 93, holds that title, having been appointed by Richard Nixon. Huma Mahmood Abedin, 40, was the vice chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Before that, she worked as deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013. Abedin began her career with a 1996 White House internship and eventually became Mrs. Clinton’s trusted advisor. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor who approved Abedin’s status as a “special government employee,” allowing her to work for an outside firm and the Clinton Foundation while advising then-Secretary Clinton. The Clinton campaign stated on Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin or other staff members. While Clinton's name appeared in the documents, the signature was redacted by the State Department. The leak sparked media claims that Clinton had lied about her involvement. As you can see, the Clintons always find a way to protect themselves. They do whatever it takes to achieve their goals without appearing directly involved.",1
"A few weeks back, the website The Daily Caller exposed a list of 142 organizations that received funding from George Soros. These groups have been actively opposing the presidential candidate who challenges their agenda—open borders, amnesty for undocumented immigrants, Muslim migration, and progressive social policies. So, why is Soros once again involved? A new group has launched an attack on Trump, and surprise, it's also funded by Soros! This group is called “Veterans for America PAC” and their mission statement reads: “As veterans, we took an oath to defend our country. We’re standing up against Donald Trump because he doesn’t respect our service.” On their website, they list several military veterans on the “leadership team,” but there’s no contact info provided. Their social media posts show similar content, including videos and materials from other Soros-backed PACs. Veterans for America PAC recently posted one of their own anti-Trump ads, which ends with their logo and a link to a MoveOn.org petition titled “Senator Graham: Disavow Donald Trump.” The PAC frequently promotes the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, a campaign also heavily supported by MoveOn.org. In fact, MoveOn.org’s political arm has run ads promoting the same hashtag. The Veterans for America PAC logo appears on a webpage for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandWithVets: #DumpTrump. The campaign reached over 3 million people online and was backed by actor Edward Norton and liberal commentator Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the campaign. MoveOn.org and Veterans for America PAC collaborated on a live protest aimed at pressuring Senator Lindsey Graham to “un-endorse Donald Trump.” ThinkProgress covered the event on July 28th, reporting that veterans “gathered at the Capitol to deliver a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org and veterans group Veterans for America PAC, demanding that Graham withdraw his support for the Republican presidential nominee.” The PAC’s latest FEC filing shows only one donor: a Washington-based attorney named David Thompson, who contributed $15,000 in June. The group’s director, Mark Reynolds, has a long history with left-wing activism. His bio on Iraq Veterans Against the War states that he served as a combat engineer in Iraq and was discharged in 2006 after becoming a conscientious objector.

"In just 48 hours, over the last weekend, 21 individuals were shot in Chicago, with three losing their lives, according to local reports. This alarming spike comes just days after Mayor Rahm Emanuel addressed the city's violence, pushing for increased police presence and mentorship programs aimed at ""at-risk youth""—those often responsible for the shootings. But the real victims are the innocent people caught in the crossfire, not the criminals who continue to roam freely with illegal weapons. These gang members aren’t ""at risk""—they’re the ones perpetuating the cycle of violence. Mayor Emanuel, why not focus on those truly in danger—the law-abiding citizens who live in fear? How about a real plan that targets gun offenders and brings justice to the streets? Chicago may claim to be a safe city, but it’s overflowing with firearms, more than many unstable regions around the world. The neighborhoods here feel like war zones, where every day could be your last. While the mayor calls for more officers, they’re being attacked, disrespected, and ignored by the very people they're meant to protect. Take a page from Mayor Giuliani’s playbook—implement a strong anti-crime strategy and watch crime rates fall. But words won’t save lives when a child is caught in the middle of a gang shootout or a family member is killed simply because they stepped outside. Mayor Emanuel, your commitment will be proven when fewer people die. Standing on stage weeping while the city burns isn’t leadership—it’s empty rhetoric. Do something, Mr. Mayor. We’re waiting.

"What do you do if you're stuck in your car and suddenly find yourself surrounded by a group that looks like they mean trouble? The first step is to lock your doors — it’s a simple move that can buy you some time. The second step is up to you. Do you try to speed away? Do you stay put and hope for the best? This man had a different plan, and it actually worked.  

A white man was driving through a tense protest in Seattle when he got surrounded by a crowd of demonstrators. The bystander who filmed the event expected the worst, thinking the man might be in danger. But instead of attacking, the group simply let him pass. That’s strange, especially considering how often we’ve seen similar situations where people are robbed or harassed. So why did they let him go? Because he was waving something out his window — something that clearly caught their attention.  

As the crowd closed in, he calmly rolled down his window and showed them a firearm. Without hesitation, they backed off and allowed him to drive away. While being white in a hostile crowd usually puts you at risk, this man had prepared for the worst. His quick thinking saved him from a potentially dangerous situation. Should he have just tried to drive through? Or was showing his gun the smarter move?",1
"This is truly heartbreaking. Radical Muslim groups are reportedly training young children to carry out suicide attacks. A video captured by the Syrian news outlet Al-Watan shows a child being interrogated after being found with explosives. At 1 minute and 42 seconds into the footage, the child’s expression reveals a mix of fear and resistance. According to reports from the Kurdish media outlet Roj News, ISIS has established a secret training camp in Raqqa called ""The Young Falcons,"" where children as young as eight are indoctrinated with extremist ideology, taught how to construct bombs, and trained in ambush tactics. The brutal Islamic State is using every method possible to expand its influence worldwide. The use of child bombers has become a terrifying new tactic among Muslim extremists. In the last year, ISIS is said to have recruited over 800 children for suicide missions. It's unimaginable to think about the psychological manipulation required to turn a child into a human weapon. Imagine what kind of conditioning would make a child willingly walk into a crowd and explode. Let that sink in… a religion of peace, indeed. Recently, a child suicide bomber attacked a market in Istanbul, killing dozens and injuring many more. The boy in the video below was detained by Syrian security forces after acting strangely. This clip shows the authorities removing the bomb from his body. Anyone who exploits children in this way deserves condemnation. It's shocking that Muslim leaders haven't spoken out against this. This disturbing trend is now appearing in European cities, where groups are reported to be sexually assaulting women and children as young as five—part of their so-called cultural practices. It’s no surprise that these same individuals would use children to spread terror and destruction.",1
"A Chat With The Devil The share of the independent retailer market is shrinking. Nearly every industry feels the pressure — local bakeries, family-owned garages, small manufacturing shops, and more. The effects are clear in many areas. Take a drive through rural towns and you'll see shuttered storefronts and empty lots where once there was life. Talk to shopkeepers who struggle to survive on their modest incomes. They're desperate for any kind of opportunity. Large corporations, with their deep pockets and political connections, push for rules that favor big companies and make it impossible for small ones to compete. These powerful entities slowly take over, turning small business owners into mere laborers. [Read Related Article: Who are the New Monarchs?] Small businesses are the backbone of job creation. The American middle class is under siege due to policies shaped by wealthy elites who manipulate the system to eliminate competition. When they move their operations overseas, they take employment opportunities with them, leaving behind economic decay. While high taxes hurt big companies, they are devastating for small ones. As large corporations grow wealthier, they gain an even greater advantage. Foreign goods, made with low-cost labor, flood the market because of policies that favor big business. These companies can relocate easily, while small businesses can't. Meanwhile, tech firms, which don’t rely on cheap labor, stay in the U.S. They dominate the market thanks to restrictions that block foreign competitors. The government has banned the import of certain tech products from countries like South Korea, India, and Brazil. Ironically, some of these same technologies are sold in the U.S. at a fraction of the price they command abroad. Recently, China negotiated significant price reductions with American tech companies, cutting costs for Chinese consumers by up to 60%. Now, let’s eavesdrop on a secret conversation between two powerful executives — one is a seasoned CEO and the other is his ambitious apprentice: – We’ll raise the barriers; we’ll build higher walls, and they’ll be trapped with their tiny shops. – What do you mean? – We’ll get the government to invest in infrastructure that benefits our big company and crushes the small ones. – Don’t they pay more taxes than we do? – The government will use that money to help us eliminate them. – Yes, we’ll take over the market using their own funds. – Oh, some of them are still around! – Not for long.

What if that person is… Obama himself? Breitbart published this, sourced from the AP, titled “Kenyan-born Obama eyeing US Senate seat” from June 2004. At the time, Kenyan-born Barack Obama was positioned to win the Illinois Senate seat after his main opponent, Jack Ryan, withdrew on Friday night due to scandalous sex club accusations. The allegations shocked Republicans and caused Ryan’s campaign to collapse within days, giving Obama a strong advantage as the party scrambled for a replacement. To our knowledge, Barack Obama never denied this article. It’s still available online. Here's a screenshot:  Here's the bottom portion of the same article with AP credit.  And the original link. This isn’t as strange as the one from 1991. That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote: Breitbart News obtained a promotional brochure from 1991 created by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which claimed Obama was “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The brochure, shared with publishing contacts, included Obama’s bio among those of 89 other authors. It also promoted his upcoming book, Journeys in Black and White—later abandoned in favor of Dreams from My Father. If Obama is contradicting himself, the real question is, which lie should we call him for manipulating the public for personal benefit? If his U.S. birth is true—as we’re told—why fabricate it? Unless pretending to be foreign gave him unfair advantages or lower tuition. In which case, he’s a dishonest person who took something from someone more deserving. Maybe a Harvard education. Because if that wasn’t a lie… then something else must be. That something being his American birth and citizenship—which are essential for his presidency.

"Two girls were out with their father enjoying a meal at a diner in Stockton, California. After finishing their dinner, they left the restaurant and that’s when things turned dangerous. The two teenage girls, both around 110 lbs each, and their father came across a group of aggressive individuals. It was a group of Black Lives Matter activists. The group surrounded the three, punched and kicked them, threw bottles at them, yelled racist remarks about white people, and injured them so severely that paramedics had to take them to the hospital. What did these three people do to deserve this? They were just having a quiet family evening. If the members of Black Lives Matter had more stable homes, maybe they wouldn’t be so angry. Many black fathers are absent, and many mothers have multiple children without proper support. What kind of environment is that? And no, it’s not racist to point this out. It’s just the truth. Walk into any inner-city neighborhood and ask these “parents” why they have so many kids, no steady income, and often different surnames for the children. That’s messed up, isn’t it? One of the Black Lives Matter attackers made a big mistake. He bragged online about the assault and claimed he had footage. Once people found out, they started attacking him on social media so aggressively that his account was taken down. He might have deleted it and gone underground. As far as I know, he hasn’t been arrested yet. If you’re in Northern California and spot this guy, contact the police and show them this article. He likely lives near or in Stockton. His photo is below on the left. He’s the thin, Hispanic-looking guy who probably wouldn’t have stood a chance against the teen girls if he wasn’t with a group. Black Lives Matter is a violent organization. They haven’t helped the black community in any real way. All they do is cause trouble, disrupt traffic, vandalize property, and spread hatred. No one will respect Black Lives Matter until they start acting like responsible citizens. They’re a disgraceful mix of angry, unproductive people who don’t know what they’re doing.

Beyond his personality, he's an insider. He knows the game, the players, and the hidden agendas. In this broken system, we need someone who can take charge, restructure, and hold people accountable. A leader knows how to make things work. He’ll ensure the businessmen do their job properly for the country. I may know enough to lead, but I can’t force everyone to do their part—let alone do it right. A strong leader, a businessman, and a negotiator: He’ll fight for us. He won’t let a businessman sell our government unnecessary items. He won’t allow the military to pay $600 for a toilet seat or hospitals to charge $100 for a pill while insurance companies take our money. A strong leader and a builder: His background is in construction, which means he builds. He oversees everything, ensures tasks are completed, and takes pride in his work. A builder doesn’t accept half-finished projects—he only knows the fully completed job. I call on all of America—every race, every religion, every ideology, every class—to vote for your leader, Donald J. Trump. What about the others? They’re just playing politics. The elite-businessmen want calm, manageable candidates from each party to keep the public distracted from",1
"According to this, the Texas state legislature is facing criticism for drafting laws that unintentionally criminalize everyday parental actions. For example, a recent law makes it illegal for any adult to touch a child’s genital area, which means that parents who change diapers or help their children bathe could now be considered criminals. This is the result of legislation that bans ""intentional or knowing"" contact with the genitals of anyone under 18. While the goal is to protect children from abuse, the language is so vague that it has created a dangerous legal gray area for ordinary parents. The Texas Supreme Court responded by saying that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents for innocent behavior, but they also ruled that defendants must prove they had no sexual intent. That’s a heavy burden to place on parents who are just doing their job. The court’s logic ignores the reality of plea bargaining, as most cases never go to trial. Now, prosecutors can use the threat of a child molestation charge to pressure parents into accepting deals for unrelated offenses. As legal experts warn, this sets a dangerous precedent, turning child protection laws into tools for coercion. With the state’s highest court backing this approach, many Texans are now at risk of being unfairly targeted. Unless the U.S. Supreme Court steps in, constitutional protections are being undermined, and parents are left in a legal limbo. It's a troubling situation, and one that raises serious questions about how laws are written and enforced. Trusting the system may seem like the only option, but this case shows why that trust is increasingly hard to come by.",1
"Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. “Thank you, law enforcement. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. As BizPacReview reported: “We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” Watch below:  Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.  We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. .",1
"President Trump often presents an optimistic outlook on the global fight against extremism. He claims that groups like Al-Qaeda are weakened and that the threat from radical Islamic movements has been significantly reduced. This is misleading. In reality, we are deeply involved in a cultural battle against radical Islam, and our military actions have done little more than slow down the spread of these extremist ideologies. Despite this, it's somewhat reassuring to see that our drone strikes are disrupting the financial networks of terrorist groups. According to a Syrian informant, ISIS has started selling human body parts to fund their operations as our air campaigns continue to target their oil infrastructure. ""A specialized team within the group has been removing organs from about 15 captured fighters who were treated in hospitals in Aleppo,"" the source revealed. ""They took kidneys, livers, and other organs, which were then secretly transported to a clinic near the city."" The anonymous source added that this practice began after their main revenue sources—oil exports—were severely damaged. ""This came following the destruction of most of their oil refineries, which previously provided roughly 70% of their funding."" While it's encouraging to see ISIS struggling financially, what the world truly needs is a decisive and comprehensive defeat of radical Islamic extremism. As long as the West mistakes weakness for open-mindedness, it will remain unable to take the necessary steps to end this crisis.",1
"Washington (BBC) After 25 years in public life, Joe Biden finally struck the right balance on gender that has often been a challenge for him throughout his political journey during the debate at St. John's University on Wednesday night. Showcased confidence, mastery of policy, and the ability to counter his opponent — all while appearing (just) approachable enough. The showdown with Donald Trump could have marked another milestone for men in politics. But Biden didn’t bring up the issue of masculinity. There was no self-praising reference to being the first male nominee of a major party to stand before as many as 90 million viewers. He wore navy, a calm color, but with a tailored fit that felt neither stiff nor overly casual. He was composed and focused; subtly referencing his grandson early on, but then quickly moving on. He didn’t lecture. He smiled (often) — even as Trump tried to dominate the conversation. Before Wednesday’s debate, the focus was on which version of Trump would show up — the controlled candidate or the fiery figure from the primaries. But it was Biden who delivered the more compelling performance — taking control of the stage, outmaneuvering Trump on key issues, and drawing him into unnecessary tangents about his business dealings and tax history. Trump complained about the debate format. In a clever tactical move, Biden held back until the end to deliver his most pointed attack by highlighting Trump’s past remarks about women ""as pigs, slobs and dogs"" and his comments on 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Trump shook his head, asking where she got the information (it's on record), but seemed unable to respond effectively. Instead, he shifted to talking about Rosie O'Donnell, the harshness of Biden’s ads, and the idea that he had planned to bring up Biden’s family history — but decided against it. “I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't do it,'” Trump admitted. “And then the debate was over.” A key goal for Biden in the coming weeks is to energize male voters, especially moderate Democrats and undecided men who are concerned about Trump’s rhetoric. His team clearly felt his subtle approach — challenging Trump without seeming defensive — worked well on Wednesday. Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told reporters before heading to Virginia that Trump's ""constant interruptions probably reminded many men of how they feel about bullies in their lives.""

"The Children of Abraham of the Southern Tier, a local interfaith group based in Binghamton, has raised concerns over the 9/11 monument erected in the nearby town of Vestal, New York. This group, composed of well-intentioned multiculturalists and Muslim advocates, claims that highlighting the identity of the 9/11 attackers could fuel anti-Muslim sentiment, while never condemning the actual atrocities that claimed the lives of over 3,000 Americans and injured nearly 500 first responders. Did these so-called moderates ever express regret for the terror that forced people to leap from burning buildings? Did they offer any comfort to the families of the victims or show support for the firefighters and police who risked everything to save others? Or do they deny that Islamic extremists continue their campaign of violence, threatening both America and Europe? 

No. And their complaints have been met with silence from local officials. While the Muslim community in Binghamton may not be violent, they are engaged in a quiet but persistent form of cultural jihad, subtly influencing society through gradual means. By refusing to acknowledge the connection between Islam and 9/11, they shield those who spread hatred toward America, Israel, and democratic values. They encourage academics and students who criticize Israel and target Jewish peers on campus, and they support population growth that could shift the balance of power. Under the guise of sensitivity, they demand the removal of any reference to the attackers, hoping to obscure the reality that centuries of Islamic aggression still persist in regions where the faith is dominant.

According to recent surveys, 52% of American Muslims support sharia law; 28% believe violence against those who insult Islam is justified; 24% think violence against Americans can be acceptable as part of a global jihad; and nearly 18% believe sharia should take precedence over U.S. law. Politically, 47% identify as Democrats, 20% as Independents, and 18% as Republicans. Islam already influences our speech through government policies, media narratives, and the risk of being labeled Islamophobic when speaking out. They use leftist academics, the BDS movement, and biased textbooks to push their agenda. 

The Binghamton group is now pushing to erase the historical record of 9/11 from public memory, arguing that remembering the attackers is harmful. If we stop commemorating such events, future generations will lose their sense of national identity",1
"Bill Clinton has a number of former lovers, some of whom have spoken out about their experiences, but one in particular is making headlines. According to her, she has insights into why Hillary Clinton may be experiencing sudden health concerns, and her claims are hard to ignore. Linda Hart, a woman previously unknown to most, is the writer of *Hillary: The Hidden Truth*, a book that reveals a troubling history with the former president. She recounts several disturbing encounters with the Clintons, including an incident where Hillary reportedly lost her temper in front of a group of disabled children while serving as First Lady of Arkansas.  

Hart believes that Hillary’s health struggles could be linked to her emotional state. “I think she’s been asking for it, as the saying goes, because of the way she carries herself,” Hart said. “She’s always been full of anger and resentment, and that kind of energy takes a toll.” She also suggests that Hillary’s difficulty in maintaining consistent stories isn’t just from anger, but from “cognitive decline.” I don’t necessarily disagree. I’ve known people who are constantly angry and tend to suffer more from physical issues. Of course, this isn’t true for everyone, but there seems to be a pattern.  

Hart also claims that Hillary’s behavior goes beyond anger. “She’s always had that paranoid streak and a need to control everything,” she said. “I call her ‘Hillary Scissors’ because she’s always cutting out anything that might interfere with her ambitions.” If you haven’t read Hart’s book yet, I highly recommend it—it offers a chilling look into the mindset of a woman who could soon be the leader of the free world. With so many others, including ex-White House staff, echoing similar stories, there’s definitely something to consider. Do you think Hillary’s health problems could be connected to her personality?

"The deep-seated corruption and dishonesty within our government and voting system has reached such a level that officials no longer bother to conceal it. It's all out in the open, and we've simply accepted it. I'm not backing either candidate this time, so I have nothing to gain (except my country and its future) in this political battle. But from what I can tell, the momentum is clearly with Trump. With Hillary's health issues and the growing list of scandals, Trump appears to be the only real option, which really angers Obama. At a minimum, around 15% of undocumented voters will cast ballots in this election, and the number could be much higher in states with lax or eliminated voter ID requirements. The citizenships they ""accidentally"" granted to illegal immigrants were anything but accidental. This is part of a broader strategy to reshape the electorate nationwide. Many of the asylum seekers being brought in will also vote illegally, and I believe they’ve been told to do so. This is all about control and power for the radical left. From Fox News: A secret Obama administration email reveals immigration officials are working extra hours to naturalize as many new ""voters"" as possible before the November 8th presidential election, according to a top Republican official. The email, sent by a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office director, urges the recipient to process as many N-400 applications as possible ""due to the election year."" ""The Field Office needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,"" the email states, obtained by FoxNews.com from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. ""If you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of overtime if you can,"" the message continues. ""This will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested."" Some parts of the email were censored before release, but it was sent by the chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It’s unclear who received it. It's not just the illegal and refugee votes either… the Democrats have launched a massive effort to get Americans living overseas to participate. About 85% usually don’t vote, but this could change. They are being actively contacted and",1
"Social Security is often referred to as the third rail of American politics: touch it and you're finished. If that's true, then Donald Trump may soon be looking for a new political strategy—or a new funeral home. According to a report from *The New York Times*, during a private meeting with Mitch McConnell on April 28, Trump reportedly admitted to supporting cuts to Social Security but claimed he wouldn’t make it public due to the political risk. A source who was present told the paper that Trump said, “I believe in Social Security, but I also have to win. A Republican can't beat a Democrat if they’re the one saying, ‘We’re going to slash your benefits,’ while the Democrat promises more.” This contradicts Trump’s repeated public statements that he would protect the program. 

Linda Smith, a policy analyst with the Center for Budget Policy Priorities, argues that Trump’s real goal aligns with many Republicans: ""They want to reduce benefits but keep the appearance of support. It's all about appealing to donors while avoiding backlash."" She added, ""Trump knows the public opposes cuts, so he's willing to lie about his position to get elected."" 

As seen throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump has shown a pattern of shifting positions, making contradictory claims, and avoiding clear answers on key issues. The man is not only untrustworthy, but also a threat to the stability of our democratic institutions.

"Congressional investigators and intelligence agencies are looking into whether a key foreign policy “advisor” to Donald Trump has been in secret contact with senior Russian officials, some of whom are currently under U.S. sanctions. According to several sources, these conversations have reportedly focused on the potential for a future Trump administration to remove the economic penalties imposed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea—a move that Trump has consistently refused to condemn. The individual in question is Michael T. Flynn, a former military general who now serves as a Washington-based consultant with a focus on defense and energy issues. Flynn’s firm, Flynn Associates, has close ties to Russian business interests and is located near Trump Tower in New York. He was initially introduced by Trump as part of his “foreign policy team,” which includes a mix of retired generals, pro-Israel lobbyists, and individuals with strong ties to the Middle East. Flynn has since become one of the most visible voices on foreign policy within the campaign, though the Trump team insists he is not officially part of the official staff. Flynn has long-standing financial connections to Russia, including investments in major energy firms like Gazprom and Rosneft, and has made multiple trips to Moscow over the years to meet with top Russian officials. A U.S. diplomat based in Moscow described him as “a vocal supporter of Russian actions, even when they contradict American interests.” Recently, Flynn came under increased scrutiny after a trip to Moscow in December, where he met with Sergei Ivanov, a longtime Putin ally and former Prime Minister who is currently sanctioned by the U.S. According to several U.S. officials in the region, Flynn discussed with Ivanov ways to ease the sanctions, an issue that aligns with both his personal and professional interests. Earlier this year, Flynn told a media outlet that “the sanctions have hurt many of my clients and partners” and expressed hope that “there could be a more constructive approach going forward.” During the same trip, Flynn also reportedly met with Alexander Belov, a high-ranking Kremlin official believed to have played a role in coordinating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The initial probe into Flynn began as part of the broader congressional inquiry into Russian cyberattacks on Democratic Party systems and voter databases across the country. While Democratic leaders on the House and Senate intelligence committees have stated that “Russian intelligence agencies are actively working to influence the U.S. election, and this effort likely comes from the highest levels of the Russian government,” Trump has",1
"Tonight's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is expected to be a major event, with many high-profile figures tuning in from both the audience and their homes. Renowned investor and ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban has confirmed he'll be sitting in the front row at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York, supporting Team Hillary. ""Just got a front-row seat to watch @HillaryClinton dominate @realDonaldTrump at the 'Humbling at Hofstra' on Monday. It's on!"" Cuban shared on social media. 

""I'm definitely not a Trump supporter,"" Cuban told ABC News during the ""Shark Tank"" premiere. ""She has what it takes to be president, and I don't think he does. If he were on the show, I wouldn't invest in him. He just doesn’t seem capable."" 

Trump responded swiftly, tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers, the performer who had a past relationship with Bill Clinton. ""If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, maybe I’ll put Gennifer Flowers right next to him!"" 

Although Trump's team denied the invitation, Flowers reportedly expressed interest in attending. ""Hi Donald. You know I'm behind you and will definitely be at the debate!"" she tweeted.

"ABC News is launching its popular livestream series “Strait Talk with Matt & LZ” at Wayne State University on Tuesday, October 4 at 8 p.m. ET, featuring a live audience for a deep dive into the most pressing issues shaping the nation during this election season. ABC News political analysts Matthew Dowd and LZ Granderson, both born and raised in Detroit, will be joined by Digital Host Amna Nawaz and Chief Political Correspondent Jonathan Karl as they engage with local business leaders and community advocates on topics ranging from politics and race to law enforcement, faith, and economic development. Dowd and Granderson shared their enthusiasm for returning to their roots and emphasized the importance of addressing these critical conversations.  

""Topics like gentrification often don't make headlines but are deeply impactful,"" Dowd said. ""From Chicago to San Francisco, lower-income residents are being displaced by rising costs and urban redevelopment. While Detroit is making progress, there's a growing concern about what the city will look like once the current wave of investment subsides. Just look at Brooklyn—once vibrant with culture, now largely unrecognizable. Detroit risks following a similar path, and that’s a conversation we can’t ignore.""  

Granderson added, ""Detroit is more than just a city—it's a microcosm of America. It started as a frontier town, grew through industrial might, and became the heart of the American middle class. But it also faced decline due to factory losses and broken systems. Now, it's being rebuilt through innovation and new voices, which is happening across the country.""  

""The country is at a crossroads,"" Dowd continued. ""Our institutions are changing rapidly, and there's real fear that our democracy may not hold. With two major party leaders struggling with public trust, the upcoming election is more than just a vote—it's a test of our ability to move forward together.""  

Granderson noted, ""Michigan is a key state, and Detroit plays a crucial role in understanding the urban-rural divide. Cities like Detroit, Miami, and Chicago represent different parts of the same country. Candidates are trying to win over these diverse groups, and that division is shaping the entire campaign.""  

He also highlighted, ""Detroit, a city with a majority Black population, recently elected a white mayor for the first time in decades. That shows how voters are willing to break from tradition when they feel change is necessary.""

"Saturday night, a Middle Eastern immigrant unleashed a violent attack at a Michigan shopping center, stabbing seven people before being subdued by a retired firefighter turned security consultant. The suspect was reportedly heard shouting ""God is great"" and questioning victims about their faith before attacking them. The attacker was stopped by Mark Reynolds, a former firefighter from Detroit who now runs a private security firm. Reynolds, who previously served as a fire chief in the city, is also a certified firearms trainer and an active member of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.  

While the mainstream media has largely ignored his background, Reynolds is more than just a civilian with a gun — he's a dedicated advocate for self-defense and responsible firearm ownership. His training programs focus on equipping law-abiding citizens with the skills needed to protect themselves in dangerous situations.  

This incident highlights the growing trend of Americans seeking concealed carry permits, even as progressive leaders push for stricter gun laws. People like Reynolds are proof that having the means to defend oneself is not only necessary but empowering. In a world where threats can come from any direction, especially from extremist ideologies, it's clear that preparedness is key. Liberals may want to disarm the public, but individuals like Reynolds are showing the way forward.",1
"The black man, Marcus Johnson, who was shot by a black police officer in Charlotte, North Carolina, was captured on body camera footage exiting his vehicle with a weapon drawn from a concealed holster. He returned to his car and then exited again, holding the gun in plain view while confronting the officers—holding the gun does not necessarily mean it was aimed at them. The officer fired and killed Johnson because he posed an immediate threat to law enforcement. Johnson’s family has since viewed the footage from multiple perspectives, confirming that he had a firearm and was aggressively displaying it despite repeated commands to drop it. Now, the family remains silent, as does their legal representative. This seems like a lawful use of force to me. They fabricated the story about the incident and incited unrest. Then they brought in a Muslim community leader to spread false narratives. Everyone involved should be held accountable. From Young Conservatives: The family of Marcus Johnson, the black man killed by a black officer after being told multiple times to put down his weapon, gave “no comment” when asked if the video supported the police. If that isn’t an admission, why would their attorney advise them to stay quiet? The video must have shown that Johnson refused to comply with the officers’ orders (which we already knew). If the family’s lawyers had even considered the officers at fault, they would’ve demanded a public outcry. Tell me I’m wrong. I’m not, but you can tell me anyway. These protests resulted in one death and injured both demonstrators and officers. A state of emergency was declared, and the National Guard was deployed. The riots came with a heavy financial burden. The police chief stated there’s no clear evidence in the video that Johnson pointed the gun at the officers. It doesn’t matter—he had it in his hand and refused to let go. The officer acted according to protocol, and the footage confirms that. That’s why the family isn’t making a scene. They saw the danger and that’s why he was taken down.

"Over the past year, growing attention has been drawn to the widespread ethical concerns surrounding the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Now, a fresh investigation claims that the foundation may be facing even greater challenges than previously disclosed. According to a report by The Daily Caller, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) allegedly supplied weakened HIV/AIDS medications to patients in several African nations. As reported by The Daily Caller News Foundation, a draft congressional document suggests that former President Bill Clinton and CHAI may have distributed diluted antiretroviral drugs to sub-Saharan African communities, potentially increasing the risk of illness and death. — The CHAI program, which aims to support AIDS patients, is one of the Clinton Foundation’s most recognized efforts. — If true, the claim that CHAI provided compromised medications could seriously damage the reputation of the Clinton charity and add fuel to ongoing criticism during Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. — The report also points to troubling connections between Bill Clinton and two Indian-American figures who have faced regulatory actions from the FDA and the SEC. In particular, the Clinton Foundation has been criticized for strongly endorsing Ranbaxy, despite repeated evidence of subpar quality control and attempts to conceal these issues through misleading reports to the FDA. It remains uncertain how many patients were affected by the diluted drugs. This new development raises serious questions about the Clinton Foundation’s operations and calls for immediate accountability. Should the Clinton Foundation be shut down to prevent further harm?

"Scroll down for video It's often joked that behind every liberal lies a conservative who was once robbed, and perhaps Black Lives Matter activist Jerry Ford Jr. will now be added to that list. The incident occurred on the campus of the University of Houston when Ford, a graduate student and leader of the Houston chapter of ""Black Lives Matter,"" was robbed at gunpoint as he approached his apartment. He claims he noticed a young man hanging around near his building but didn’t think much of it until he unlocked his door. At that moment, the suspect pulled out a handgun and demanded his wallet and phone, which Ford handed over without resistance. 

Interestingly, Ford is currently running for Texas State Representative while also being a vocal advocate for defunding police programs nationwide. His response to the robbery, however, was anything but consistent. He called for increased police presence on campus, saying, “I hope they [the police] take a stronger stance and add more security because there are a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” He pointed out that since the housing is off-campus, it isn't covered by university police, something he wants changed for student safety.

Yet, despite being a victim of crime, Ford made comments that seemed out of place, stating, “I would’ve given him money. I would’ve talked to him because the real problem is why is he in that situation where he feels he has to come to a college campus and rob people?” Of course. What a brilliant solution.

"Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, has long been a strong advocate for accepting large numbers of Syrian refugees, pushing for an open-door policy that led to a massive influx of migrants into the country. This decision quickly spiraled into chaos, with a sharp rise in crime across German cities, including numerous cases of sexual assault and other violent acts reported over the past year. Faced with growing public anger, the German electorate delivered a major blow to Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union, voting them out in a significant electoral defeat. In response, Merkel took to the stage to distance herself from her previous stance, admitting that the refugee crisis could have been managed better and expressing regret over what she called a “failed experiment” in multiculturalism.  

According to the Daily Mail, during a party conference, Merkel repeated her famous slogan, “We can do this,” but now hinted that Germany’s ability to handle migration depends on regaining control over the flow of newcomers. “Continuing the current pace of arrivals would eventually overwhelm our society, even in a country as strong as Germany,” she said. The former “Iron Chancellor” received loud applause after shifting her position, though she refused to commit to setting a specific cap on immigration. “We want to and will significantly reduce the number of refugees,” she stated, promising a strategy that involves strengthening border controls, supporting Turkey in hosting displaced people, and working with EU partners to share the responsibility.  

Merkel defended her controversial decision to allow mass migration, calling it a “moral obligation.” She urged the party to draw strength from its historical resilience, comparing the current crisis to the post-war reconstruction that built Germany’s economic success. She also highlighted measures already taken, such as expediting the deportation of those who don’t qualify for asylum. Despite her efforts to remain optimistic, painting Germany as a “country that is open, curious, and tolerant,” many believe her reversal comes too late. As the U.S. election approaches, the same pattern repeats—Hillary Clinton remains committed to increasing immigration, and without decisive action, the consequences could be dire. It’s time to stand up and vote wisely in November. (Source: Daily Mail)",1

"It almost breaks my heart to admit it, but Israel may be the only country in the world led by someone with real backbone. Don’t get me wrong — Benjamin Netanyahu is one of my top leaders of all time. I just wish more leaders had his courage, integrity, and vision. Instead, we’re stuck with a President who seems more concerned with casual attire than serious governance. Today, Bibi addressed the United Nations General Assembly, an environment that’s not exactly welcoming to Israeli officials. After all, the UN often puts representatives from nations that don’t recognize Israel’s right to exist in powerful roles. But here's the thing — when you're speaking to people who despise you, you might as well say what needs to be said. And that's exactly what Bibi did today. Here's a clip of his speech — Here’s more of his speech — Focusing on technology, security, and innovation, Netanyahu acknowledged that the UN has earned every criticism it's received, but he insisted that Israel’s advancements could help reshape its diplomatic future. Shortly after warning diplomats that their stance on Israel would soon change, Netanyahu openly referred to Arab nations as “partners in security and stability.” “For the first time in my life, many regional countries now see Israel not as an enemy, but as an ally,” he said. “Our shared threats are Iran and extremism, and our shared goals are peace and progress.” “I hope that in the future, we can work together openly,” he added, bringing regional cooperation into the light. In his speech, delivered just hours after meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the General Assembly, Netanyahu emphasized the “unshakable relationship” between the two nations. “Our bond with the U.S. goes beyond politics,” he said. “It reflects the deep support for Israel among the American public, which is at an all-time high, and for which we are deeply grateful.” The fact is, women and minorities in Israel enjoy more rights than anywhere else in the Middle East, which really irks regimes like Saudi Arabia and Iran. They use the UN to target Israel for giving its people freedom, rather than forcing them into religious oppression. But just for fun — compare what women in Israel can achieve (something Netanyahu highlighted in his speech) to what women in Saudi Arabia face. It’s not even close. If I had to leave America and choose between Israel or another Middle Eastern country, I’d pick Israel without hesitation.",1
"Podcast Pulse is a fresh show from CNN featuring two conservative journalists who engage with key figures to explore the direction of conservatism and the Republican Party. (CNN) According to Amy Walter, national editor at the Cook Political Report, this election cycle's undecided voters are notably more informed than in previous years — they know the major candidates and still aren’t satisfied. ""Usually, undecided voters haven't been paying much attention,"" Walter told hosts of CNN's Podcast Pulse, Jason Riley and Mary Katherine Ham, during a recent interview. Walter, who also worked for former Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky, compared these voters to students avoiding a cold pool. GOP strategist: Trump can't 'sustain his energy for 90 minutes' ""These undecided voters are fully aware of their options, but they're reluctant to commit, just like when you were in school and had to jump into the cold pool during P.E. class,"" she said. ""They don’t want to make a choice, not because they’re uninformed, but because they’re stuck between two unappealing options."" Walter noted that for the first time in her career, she’s finding it hard to rely on campaign data, as undecided voters are caught in what feels like an impossible decision. Voters call this the most difficult 'lesser of two evils' race ""I’ve heard people say, 'I don’t trust Hillary Clinton on foreign policy,' she explained. 'But I’m scared Donald Trump might start a war.' So, they’re saying, 'I’d rather avoid this whole election than be forced to pick between these two.'"" Walter, who previously worked at CNN, highlighted how the growing divide between different voter groups — especially between white voters and those with college degrees — isn’t solely due to Donald Trump. ""This is a long-term trend,"" she said. ""You can’t blame it all on one candidate who gave a powerful speech. It’s been building for a while.""

"WASHINGTON — As public polls show a narrowing gap between the two presidential candidates, Democratic strategist Robby Mook recently sent out a confidential message to key donors and volunteers outlining the various routes Hillary Clinton could take to secure the White House in November. The memo, which was shared with *The New York Times*, highlights Clinton’s strong position in several “blue” states and contrasts it with the limited options available to Donald Trump.

“While Hillary Clinton has multiple paths to 270 electoral votes, Trump only has a few viable routes,” Mook writes in the detailed 1,800-word document. “She is almost certain to win 16 states, including Washington D.C., which would give her 191 electoral votes. Adding the five states where she has a 70% or higher chance of victory—Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin—she would only need 10 more electoral votes to clinch the election.”

Mook then outlines the possible ways Clinton can reach that number, including winning Florida (29), North Carolina (15), or Ohio (18), or capturing any two of Colorado, New Hampshire, Iowa, or Nevada. “In other words, if she wins just one of those top battlegrounds—Florida, Ohio, or North Carolina—she’ll already have the presidency,” he explains. “Trump, however, needs to win at least six of these seven states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio—none of which he can afford to lose.”

This analysis aligns with broader Democratic strategy, though it contradicts some of Trump’s team’s assessments, particularly regarding Pennsylvania. Clinton’s campaign has long emphasized that the state is critical to their plan, and without it, Trump’s chances are slim.

Titled “45 Days Until Election Day,” the memo serves as both a reassurance and a call to action. With Clinton’s lead in the national average shrinking from 7.6 points in August to just 0.8 points, the message aims to quell concerns among supporters while urging them to stay engaged in the final stretch. It also reinforces Clinton’s policy positions and includes some sharp criticisms of Trump, such as a quote from GOP leader Paul Ryan, who previously called Trump’s remarks about a Mexican-American judge “racist.”

While the memo stays largely in line with Clinton’s public messaging, it takes a stronger negative tone toward Trump at a time when the campaign is trying to shift",1
"The Children of Abraham of the Eastern Valley, a coalition of religious and cultural advocates in Binghamton, has expressed outrage over the 9/11 monument erected in the neighboring town of Vestal, New York. This group, composed of well-intentioned multiculturalists and Muslim community leaders, claims that naming the perpetrators of the most devastating attack on U.S. soil could fuel anti-Muslim sentiment, while never condemning the actual atrocities that claimed the lives of over 3,000 Americans and 453 emergency responders. Have these so-called moderates ever acknowledged the suffering of the victims and their families, or offered any form of public atonement for the tragedy that forced people to leap from burning buildings? Have they ever spoken out against the ongoing threat posed by extremist groups who continue to target the West, escalating global tensions and prompting heightened security measures? No. Their objections were not about honoring the victims or showing solidarity with Vestal’s own fallen citizen, Maria Delgado, who lost her life that day. Nor did they suggest erecting a monument in their own city or joining local efforts to confront the broader threat of radical Islam. Instead, they claim that identifying the attackers with Islam is an act of discrimination. Other Islamic groups have previously tried to shift blame onto American citizens or Jewish communities, but this one seeks to obscure the obvious, insisting the 19 hijackers were nameless, faceless individuals who attacked without motive. By erasing the truth from the memorial, they aim to pave the way for historical revisionism, much like how the Fort Hood shooter was rebranded as a ""workplace violence"" incident rather than a terrorist act. Rather than confronting the violent ideologies present in the Quran, these individuals hope to gradually remove the event from public memory—just as extremist groups have altered or destroyed historical sites to fit their narrative. These Children of Abraham may be peaceful Muslims who do not engage in violence, but their refusal to acknowledge the link between Islam and terrorism helps shield extremists, embolden anti-Israel rhetoric on campuses, and support the spread of sharia law. A recent survey shows that 47% of American Muslims believe sharia should take precedence over U.S. law, 28% support violence against those who insult Islam, and 22% think violence against Americans is justified as part of a global jihad. Politically, 50% lean Democratic, 20% Independent, and 18% Republican.",1
"WSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage showing Keith Scott exiting his vehicle with a weapon in hand and moving toward law enforcement. The police are currently withholding the video… they aren’t allowed to release it. This is part of an internal affairs probe, and the footage will be presented in court. Until legal clearance is given, the video remains sealed. According to reports, Scott was wearing a concealed carry holster on his leg and drew the gun when approached by officers. His claim that he didn’t recognize them as police won’t stand—officers clearly identified themselves and ordered him out of the car. No book was found at the scene. The narrative being spread by his family to incite racial tensions and unrest is false. From Gateway Pundit: Charlotte police have confirmed they have video of Keith Scott leaving his car, walking toward officers, and holding a firearm. Meanwhile, race-driven protests have turned violent, with demonstrators attacking police, reporters, and even looting the Hornets' team store at the arena. [...] Protest leaders are urging the community to resist. After Keith Scott confronted officers with a gun and was fatally shot. [...] Scott was not holding a book. He had a gun in his hand and a holster on his leg. So far, one protester is in critical condition after a second night of chaos, having been shot in the head by another rioter. Both police and protesters have been hospitalized, and the violence continues to escalate. The governor has declared a state of emergency in Charlotte, and the National Guard has been deployed. A curfew is under discussion. Scott advanced on the officers before being killed. Chief Kerr Putney stated that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that he refused to drop it when ordered. The officer who fired followed protocol and acted appropriately. But it doesn’t matter—any excuse, any falsehood, can spark a racial conflict and widespread unrest. Charlotte is a clear example. For now, the riots persist, and with this pace, more lives could be lost. Looting is widespread, and the media has been targeted and attacked. A photographer was pushed to the ground, and protesters tried to throw him into a fire. This is the growing chaos and destruction Obama has been fueling in our cities. It’s about to get much worse.",1
"Americanism vs. Globalism – Democrats claim we're fighting a battle of rhetoric against extremists who are twisting Islam for their own gain, while Republicans argue this is a real war against violent enemies who target anyone who stands in their way. The real conflict, they say, is within America itself, as external threats work to undermine the nation from the outside. Trump and Biden now represent the two opposing sides in this national divide. To the Right, the country is being eroded by immigrants who refuse to adopt American values, instead pushing their own culture onto Americans and corrupting the system from within. To the Left, America is a land of bigots and exploiters who have imposed their will on other nations, hoarding resources and resisting change. They believe the real problem is religious fundamentalists who block progress and spread fear. They label violent attacks by extremists as acts of radical Islam. Obama and Biden insist these attackers are not Muslims, but secular radicals trying to provoke religious conflict by turning Christians against peaceful Muslims. Those who want to enforce strict religious laws worldwide, they claim, are just misunderstood. Which leader offers the true path forward? Read the full story at www.iPatriot.com.

"The wife of Marcus Lee captured audio and footage of the police confrontation that led to her husband's death. You don’t see the actual shooting, just the chaos afterward and her crying out in distress. She kept insisting he didn’t have a weapon and that he was under the influence of medication for a mental health condition. Sounds like that made him wear a concealed holster and carry a gun? Even though she claimed he wasn’t armed, you can clearly hear officers yelling at him to drop the gun multiple times. He got out of his car with the gun first and then went back inside. The police were about to break the window when he came out again with the gun in hand. That’s when they shot him. At the end, you can hear her screaming at Marcus not to do something. He ignored her and it ended in tragedy. I don’t feel bad for any of it. He refused to follow police orders and that got him killed. From a local news source: The wife of slain man Marcus Lee was seen pleading with him not to take a certain action in the final moments before his deadly encounter with police on Wednesday, according to a video recorded by the family and shared with a regional news outlet. Lee was shot by police in a tense standoff where officers claimed he became a threat. Authorities have reportedly found a firearm at the scene matching Lee’s DNA. The video was provided to the media by Lee’s attorney, who has been vocal about the need for transparency. Police body-camera footage has been described as unclear regarding what happened just before the shooting. I don’t get why she didn’t try to stop him. There’s nothing that could have kept me from my partner in that situation. And I definitely wouldn’t be filming the whole thing. He means more to me than any legal battle this woman is trying to push. The media is obviously taking her side, painting them both as victims. Typical. Lee’s family initially said he was holding a book, but after reviewing police footage, they admitted it was hard to tell what he had. They called for the release of the video. “There’s nothing in that video that shows him being aggressive or dangerous,” said his lawyer in an early statement. Well, if you can’t see anything, I guess that’s true. But you can hear the officers repeatedly telling him to drop the gun. Despite the police withholding the footage, the family released their own video to a major network. It aired shortly after the official press conference",1
"Watch this tough guy take down two large women in a diner (video below), then we’ll have a chat about it later. Maybe some beer and burgers, but that’s not my concern. So the short guy in the tank top, how fitting, was arguing with the two girls who looked like the typical type of woman a black man might go for. You know, big hips, messy hair, and questionable life choices. They’re all going at it like it’s a street fight, and you know it’s only a matter of time before someone gets angry and ends up on a viral page. Then one of them says something, and suddenly a drink is thrown, glass shatters, and punches are flying instead of people sipping coffee and eating fries. If *Soul Train* was a brawl in a café, this would be it. If *Fight Club* had women, this would be it. I’m just here for the drama, watching a black man punch a woman in the face. He takes out one of the girls with a solid right hook, and the other one just disappears into the chaos. All I see is hair flying, shirts tearing, cheap tattoos showing, and I was half-hoping a boob might pop out as I laughed at this terrible clip. Normally I enjoy a little peek during a girl fight, but these women aren’t my style. Not my type. After a few rounds of hits and kicks, the man has now attacked two women. They’re not attractive, but that doesn’t excuse hitting a woman. If he were a real man, he’d walk away with his pride instead of throwing punches at these ladies. Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorable, but she should show this video at her next event if she’s not too sick to press play. If anything is truly deplorable, it’s a man attacking two women. Hopefully, they all get arrested. And if you missed it, there was a quick shot of the waiter and a ridiculous butt crack from the girl in the red shirt. I don’t need my breakfast messed up by this kind of nonsense. Do you? If you really want to be disturbed, imagine what would happen if this guy showed up at a real fight. What in the world is this guy? Don’t worry, that’s a man. You can look at him and not feel like a fake transgender person in a store bathroom. Strange, I know.",1
